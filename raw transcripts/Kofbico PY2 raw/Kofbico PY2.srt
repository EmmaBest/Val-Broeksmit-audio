1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Right now. Good.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay. Yeah.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Where are my phones?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Uh-huh. Where am I?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Deployed.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Deployed.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, why don't you take these out for a second?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One, two, three.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't think I like these jeans.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They're really great.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, very.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, especially when we run the run.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you, baby.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're kind of...

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Normal guy.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Normal guy?

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, good.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Cool.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Cool style.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Like, very stylish.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Nice.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't...

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't wear this stuff.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Huh?

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, my cigarette.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, yeah, my check.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I need that mask.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And my cigarette loaves.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are you using now?

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Uh, later.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Like a small one.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, I think I have one in my bag, actually.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, perfect.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This one scares me.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's not good.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can put that somewhere else.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
One, two, three.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Courage, huh?

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do you want to give me back all the other stuff?

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The, um...

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The bad greeners?

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah.

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you want that back?

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, this one.

54
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay.

55
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can't do this one.

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is it bad?

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah.

60
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't do this.

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know if it's...

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's good.

64
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's good?

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

66
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's beautiful.

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, that's beautiful.

68
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You...

69
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm gonna picture you in your beauty.

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wow.

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay.

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's all.

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's all.

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Um...

76
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Maybe you can meet me if you come downstairs now.

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why don't you go by the building?

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Come here.

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come here.

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, no, in front of the building.

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Just get in there.

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Just...

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just get your best friend in the building, please.

84
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why are you both doing that with your top?

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That would be that, no.

86
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is not France in 1992.

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Both shoulders off.

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's better.

89
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's what I'm talking about.

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What?

91
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm telling you to come down and meet me.

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
See, he's supposed to come down and meet me.

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You have to sneak me in, remember?

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's heading down now.

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, I'll say Marie wants me...

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you do well?

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you need to do well?

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, I do.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm saying you just want to briefly meet him and say hi.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Sure.

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sure.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll miss you.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll keep you.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You want me to put some of this on this guy?

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He's covered in this.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm going to tell him we're outside in the parking lot.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You said it's cool to meet him, you can meet him.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're outside in the parking lot.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Drop off your air.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, too.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Drop off your air.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Red Mini, you can't do this here.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Where is it?

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Here.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's up?

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Where is that?

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm worried.

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Aw, thank you.

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Perfect.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, yes.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Good idea, baby.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What?

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's a good one.

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I like the pie.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Nice.

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're not switching too much.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I am so hot.

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There will be air con inside.

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
My story.

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a cool thing because it's like an internet joint.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah?

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Look.

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Super elegant.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You look super cool.

141
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Super stylish.

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Super fashionable.

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I like it.

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I need you.

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's the best thing.

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Not as bad as me.

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you want one of these or do you have another one?

148
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, good.

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well done.

150
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Perfect.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Good, good, good.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's what I'm talking about.

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Smart.

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
See you again.

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you so much.

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you.

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll give myself a bit.

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Pipe.

159
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's what you can't use.

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You have a band on your arm.

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is it your boyfriend?

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is it your husband?

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is it your boyfriend?

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No, no, no.

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Is it your controlling boyfriend?

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They looked at me.

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They were like...

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Who?

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Nothing.

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What was the thing?

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You have a band.

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I just...

173
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I did not know what it was to me.

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Look, what did they...

175
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it like...

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, I was cooking and...

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They mean anything about it?

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, no.

179
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They just looked at me and looked at me and looked at me.

180
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hello.

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
How's my hair?

183
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's okay.

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What's it?

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's okay.

186
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't worry about it.

187
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It just makes my hair look a little stupid.

188
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's okay.

189
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's weird.

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's okay?

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We need some sun.

192
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I know.

193
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We need some sunglasses.

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh my God, yeah.

195
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Maybe we can do that today.

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, can you make appointments at the Apple Store for us?

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Soon after your...

198
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Your thing, we can go directly to the Apple Store.

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You get a new pair of glasses.

200
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We can go directly to the Apple Store.

201
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You get a new phone.

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So we're not being hacked by everybody.

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, you do, because you're hacked by everybody.

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, but in your ear.

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, yeah?

207
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Did you get them?

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't...

209
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are you doing?

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No, but they're in there.

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, okay.

213
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I know, it's annoying, but...

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Not helpful.

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's really loud.

216
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's really, really super loud, baby.

217
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You just can't blow my ears like that.

219
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All right, so where are the plans today?

220
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Today's plans.

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

222
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're gonna do this.

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Y'all on goes.

224
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You might pick me up.

225
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You might not.

226
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So I'll take Uber and then go to...

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, shit.

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, no.

229
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I left it inside.

230
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, I need my keys.

231
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, there's the Fanta.

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The pineapple Fanta?

233
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

234
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ah.

235
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wonderful.

236
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you.

237
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Perfect.

238
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, no.

239
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
One, two, three.

240
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I got it.

241
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Do you have to go?

242
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, well, he's gonna come.

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All right?

244
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I told him Red Mini, you can't miss us.

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Good night.

246
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, just leave it here.

247
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah.

248
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Put on the hazards.

249
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Put the hazards on.

250
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Nice.

251
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Lock it, yeah.

252
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mr. Reed.

253
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mr. Reed.

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mr. Reed.

255
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hello, Mr. Reed.

256
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There are four lights.

257
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Do you have the lights on?

258
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

259
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, running.

260
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's going right now.

261
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What about this back?

262
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
See the back?

263
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It sticks out?

264
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't have the key.

265
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No.

266
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't have the key back.

267
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't have the key.

268
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't have the key.

269
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you sure?

270
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't know.

271
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know.

272
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can fix that.

273
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You did great.

274
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You did great.

275
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, here we are.

276
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hello.

277
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey.

278
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's Daniel.

279
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
David.

280
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
David Koh.

281
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Nice to meet you.

282
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Cheers.

283
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is Mary High.

284
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry?

285
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, good play.

287
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
All right, Bo.

288
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Nice to meet you.

289
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, good to be here.

290
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Remember I spoke the other night?

293
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

294
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's all right?

295
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's all right.

296
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's all right.

297
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
She almost killed me like five times getting here.

298
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
She's French and a woman.

299
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She's got two cliches against her.

300
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
French and a woman.

301
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, there's your first go.

302
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Enjoy.

303
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Enjoy.

304
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I got it.

305
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I got it.

306
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, careful.

307
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Remember to shake on my back.

308
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you.

309
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right, guys.

310
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thanks.

311
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How's it going?

312
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Good, good.

313
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Boeing.

314
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Is that your name, is that it?

315
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

316
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Like the...

317
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, where's my mask?

318
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

319
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The company, right?

320
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

321
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Look at it.

322
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Do your parents...

323
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Is that the one staff that comes down?

324
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, my God.

325
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There was some, but not for LA.

326
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay.

327
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Really weird.

328
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So easy.

329
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Cool.

330
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

331
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, it was part of our strategy.

332
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Lightened up a little bit.

333
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Sorry I'm late, though.

334
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, come on.

335
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's like LA.

336
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're from here.

337
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's...

338
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're not from here.

339
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, no, no.

340
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Not me.

341
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Not from here.

342
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We're going to get you a visitor, guys.

343
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What?

344
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Is there a visitor?

345
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Come on in, sir.

346
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have a photo of it.

347
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I need a physical ID, unless you guys are okay with that.

348
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is actually my fault because I lost my drugs license a few days ago.

349
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know where it is.

350
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's in a bookshelf.

351
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's on my bookshelf.

352
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's okay.

353
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You guys are okay with that?

354
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay.

355
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Just go ahead and place all your items here in the bin for me.

356
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay.

357
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, now do you want to let you know you were entering the federal facility?

358
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, we are conducting.

359
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sir, one second.

360
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay, listen to me.

361
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not done with this inspection, okay?

362
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay.

363
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We are inspecting for weapons and explosives.

364
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You have nothing like that on you?

365
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No, I don't.

366
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You can still carry any tools, knives, pepper spray, nothing like that?

367
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay.

368
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Let's do your belt off.

369
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, great.

370
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay.

371
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm going to have you take off your coat.

372
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sure.

373
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sure.

374
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No problem.

375
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You guys, what are you doing?

376
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Do you have any electronics?

377
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

378
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, they're all in here.

379
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, put them separately, boss.

380
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Separately from your bag.

381
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

382
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can put them right here with your document.

383
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Put your document here.

384
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Put your document right there, okay?

385
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

386
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll leave them in the bag.

387
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You want to take them out of there?

388
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Take them out of there.

389
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay.

390
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I brought some stuff.

391
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He said don't bring anything.

392
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I thought you marked it.

393
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I thought you were just being polite.

394
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I brought a little stuff for you.

395
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay.

396
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

397
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

398
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And nothing else on you?

399
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Nope.

400
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay.

401
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just go ahead and...

402
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, wait.

403
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't mean anything.

404
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, everything out of your pocket.

405
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay?

406
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

407
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So you have nothing with your name on it?

408
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I do.

409
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

410
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But I'll show it to you on my phone.

411
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm going to have my wallet full of cards.

412
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, okay.

413
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Just hang on to it for now, okay?

414
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's fine.

415
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Stand right over there, okay?

416
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Give me one second.

417
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
One second.

418
00:11:46,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I didn't know how to play dirty support.

419
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay.

420
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Go ahead and walk through, sir.

421
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Straight through, okay?

422
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay.

423
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There we go.

424
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay.

425
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You said you have a picture of your ID or something like that?

426
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, I do.

427
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay.

428
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm going to give you...

429
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just my recessions.

430
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to see that because they can make you a badge.

431
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Of course, sir.

432
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here's my phone.

433
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

434
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Give it to the receptionist.

435
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, wait.

436
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
They're going to want my phone.

437
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay.

438
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Give it to the receptionist.

439
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

440
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Give it to the receptionist.

441
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, wait.

442
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They're going to want my phone.

443
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay.

444
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Okay.

445
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Give it to the receptionist.

446
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, wait.

447
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They're going to want my phone.

448
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay.

449
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay.

450
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are the rules for the mask?

451
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Keep it on.

452
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
All times?

453
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Sure.

454
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

455
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

456
00:12:39,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Ma'am, thank you for following me.

457
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's much, much, much easier than it was last time I was here.

458
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sorry?

459
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This is me.

460
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's new, huh?

461
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

462
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's why.

463
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This used to be called a coffee.

464
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, yeah.

465
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And there's a guy selling coffee over here, too.

466
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Right?

467
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.

468
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If that doesn't, I'm not going to go.

469
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Anyway.

470
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, okay.

471
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Is there still coffee inside?

472
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

473
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, do you need coffee?

474
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm going to get some coffee.

475
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah.

476
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't have to go through all this again, do I?

477
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No.

478
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay.

479
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You guys want anything?

480
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, I'm good.

481
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay.

482
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No?

483
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

484
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Um, coffee.

485
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

486
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Sorry.

487
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Just, you know.

488
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you need it on your bag?

489
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I like that.

490
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

491
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a gift from Marie.

492
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, cool.

493
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah.

494
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
She's a good friend.

495
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah.

496
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
She's a good friend.

497
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah.

498
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah.

499
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
She's, uh – she's learning.

500
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She's very jealous.

501
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Really wanting to come and hang out with you guys.

502
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, yeah.

503
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She's so married.

504
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
She's like, but I speak eight languages.

505
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You know?

506
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Eight.

507
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Which languages?

508
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, uh, uh, English, I know, right?

509
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
English, Swiss, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian.

510
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Huh?

511
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And I think she – uh, Chinese.

512
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I apologize, I think because of like Chinese pandemic stuff, usually they're coming here.

513
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, oh really? In the break room upstairs to the floor?

514
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, you know what there is.

515
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, perfect, okay.

516
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Good morning gentlemen.

517
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Good morning. We have a visitor here, and he's from...

518
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Thank you.

519
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Cheers.

520
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Can you see my partner?

521
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thanks.

522
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You guys want to do this again?

523
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, okay.

524
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Thank you.

525
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Thank you.

526
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Cool.

527
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Does everyone make fun?

528
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Um...

529
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Really, huh?

530
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, usually you'll feel comfortable here because of your game console.

531
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh, dang it.

532
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You know, I get to meet about a fun man or two different people.

533
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I remember this tent floor.

534
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I handed my stuff, we go to another one over there.

535
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Exactly, same thing.

536
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And then what we just handled over there used to be handled on a tent floor.

537
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah.

538
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

539
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So that girl's no longer working here?

540
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's a floor lady?

541
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, it's always changing.

542
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
She's so nice.

543
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Super nice.

544
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, that could be it.

545
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

546
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Still not.

547
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Are you guys there?

548
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So, some of you are special agents?

549
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yep.

550
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And you are DC3?

551
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Uh, I'm not...

552
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not...

553
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know, I'm not part of their...

554
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, no.

555
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Their hierarchy.

556
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No, I'm not.

557
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's not the...

558
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's the general hierarchy.

559
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
In New York.

560
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's everything but Russia.

561
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
DC3.

562
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, so it usually doesn't work in the same way.

563
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh.

564
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah.

565
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So different...

566
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Different to a lot of different things.

567
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Cool.

568
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, there.

569
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I see what you're saying.

570
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

571
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

572
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You remember that?

573
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I do.

574
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, wait.

575
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's my natural that's supposed to...

576
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, right.

577
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Thanks.

578
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay.

579
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What's going to do with it?

580
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I wonder if we're all thoroughly...

581
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What's going on?

582
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Did you get a chance to...

583
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There were four lights.

584
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Clever.

585
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I liked it.

586
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I liked it.

587
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'd love you to get the reference.

588
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, I got it.

589
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I got it.

590
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's what it is.

591
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's supposed to make a random number.

592
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah, that's good.

593
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.

594
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I was surprised you spelled out four, though.

595
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, I think...

596
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Because I never thought we'd take anything.

597
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, it was?

598
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, okay.

599
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, that's how it is.

600
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's good.

601
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, you read the call of Winston.

602
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's from Winston.

603
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And he's being tortured.

604
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Right.

605
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Writing in the floor.

606
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a portless floor.

607
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
A two-plus-two-plus-four.

608
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Interesting.

609
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No.

610
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's the one where there are five lights.

611
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And he makes cards saying that there are four.

612
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, no.

613
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He makes them say that there are five lights.

614
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know, but that's...

615
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But it's taken from 1984?

616
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

617
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Right after the record.

618
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Right after the record.

619
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Nice.

620
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Cool.

621
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He probably grabbed all the stuff.

622
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay.

623
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Is there another room?

624
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah.

625
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think I might have a bigger...

626
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, it's okay.

627
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I like the other side of the room.

628
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Sorry, this side.

629
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's a big one.

630
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's gonna be good.

631
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hang on there.

632
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't...

633
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Cool.

634
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, this is...

635
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is Thailand.

636
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Thailand?

637
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How do you do it?

638
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Nice to meet you.

639
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Can I take a hand?

640
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, I know, it's a...

641
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The virtual way, right?

642
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Sure, sure.

643
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Patty, are you from Houston as well?

644
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No.

645
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
LA?

646
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's from LA.

647
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay.

648
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Do you like your coffee?

649
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Lots of milk sugar.

650
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Milk sugar?

651
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, please.

652
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Can I take off my mask?

653
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Good.

654
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We casual here?

655
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Okay.

656
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have one.

657
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Take it really.

658
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I just can't get the frogs up my glasses.

659
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah.

660
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You do it with your fogger.

661
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I know.

662
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You know?

663
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I've got some people with a mask.

664
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, yeah.

665
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I've got a clear one.

666
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, like a face shield.

667
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah.

668
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But now they're saying,

669
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
oh, are you in the mask?

670
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, I think so.

671
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Right, right.

672
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's very, really.

673
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do you need both of them?

674
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't know.

675
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
There are some.

676
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There are some.

677
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, that's a lot.

678
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't wait for the last time.

679
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm just gonna leave this.

680
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Believe it or not,

681
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Russia just did the other vaccine yesterday.

682
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Of course they did.

683
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I saw that.

684
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I saw that too, right?

685
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's propaganda.

686
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's propaganda.

687
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, I'm sure.

688
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I saw that too.

689
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Thank you.

690
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Good to care.

691
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So I'm so excited to hear what this is about.

692
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't think I can take it anymore.

694
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's like so thrilling.

695
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I've got four guesses.

696
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Can I guess?

697
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Sure, you can guess it.

698
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay.

699
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Does it have to do...

700
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't think it has to do with things.

701
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It probably doesn't have to tell you.

702
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It doesn't make you feel like that.

703
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No, I'm just gonna double.

704
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
All right, let me see if I can read you.

705
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Based on my guesses.

706
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't think it's related to banking.

707
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay.

708
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay.

709
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think it's related to hacking.

710
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay.

711
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think it has something to do with Emma.

712
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay.

713
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How am I?

714
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm close?

715
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I couldn't read you.

716
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, no, you're getting a different one the first time.

717
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Your eyes went to the right.

718
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Usually, eyes up to the right,

719
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
you're creating something.

720
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Down to the left, it acts as a memory.

721
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So, everything I've read and studied about that

722
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is actually co-pulsion.

723
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It is co-pulsion.

724
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You've got to know the person who does that.

725
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It is true.

726
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You've got to get a baseline with the person first.

727
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Whatever.

728
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's not like global.

729
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Because you think about it,

730
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
if that was true.

731
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

732
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Every co-returnment,

733
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
you'd be able to find out immediately

734
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
who's blocking the business.

735
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's true.

736
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's true.

737
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Because detection of deception

738
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
is incredibly difficult, unfortunately.

739
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Well, do you think so?

740
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I think it's pretty easy.

741
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's a research issue.

742
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If you know how you are deceptive,

743
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
then you will know how someone else is deceptive.

744
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Except for certain type.

745
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I would have to see.

746
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Lisa?

747
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So, there's different types of liars, too.

748
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
There's Machiavellian liars,

749
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
who will lie just a lot.

750
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
They'll lie because that's just what they did

751
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
every single day of their life.

752
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Trump.

753
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Then, on the other side of the world,

754
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
there's what you can call the Catholic school

755
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
boy or girl.

756
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
They've grown up with a fear of lying,

757
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
where anytime they lie,

758
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
they're like,

759
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I just said that my name is David.

760
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What does he think my name is?

761
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The shame associated with guilt.

762
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So, those are, yeah, exactly.

763
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So, those are two very distinctly different types of liars

764
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
who lie very distinctly different.

765
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So, for example, the Machiavellian liars

766
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
is harder to detect on the line.

767
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Because it's constant lines.

768
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
There's no baseline.

769
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And the opposite would be the Catholic school boy or girl

770
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
is harder to detect because they're constantly triggering.

771
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, they honestly think that they're lying about something

772
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
even when they're not.

773
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What about the sort of desperate liars

774
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
that are trying to stay alive?

775
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot.

776
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's what it means.

777
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I've read a couple books on it,

778
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and we've taken a couple classes.

779
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah, that's what I was curious about in your classes.

780
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Do they teach that?

781
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Do they teach a chronicle or something?

782
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Like, that's a thing that I'm sure

783
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
can be used to see someone's life

784
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and there are things that we'll do.

785
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And there's things that I do

786
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
as part of my normal daily life.

787
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah.

788
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Well, what I do is I ask you questions.

789
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I know you'll post your name

790
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
when it's your birthday,

791
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
because they're at low.

792
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
No.

793
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then I'll see how you react to the honest question.

794
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And then I'll ask you something I know you don't know,

795
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and I'll see how you react to that.

796
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And that's how I establish a baseline.

797
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's my method, though.

798
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's a good thing.

799
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's how I do it.

800
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What about you?

801
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You have polygraph, huh?

802
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What's a polygraph?

803
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
No, no, I'm not.

804
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm not.

805
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm never taking polygraph.

806
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I would like to if you guys weren't helping out.

807
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It'd be fun.

808
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But no, I just, you know,

809
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I like people.

810
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Well, actually, I hate people, but I like...

811
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I love and I hate people,

812
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
but I like to study things.

813
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't know.

814
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Very cool.

815
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Very cool.

816
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That was nice of you,

817
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
we're going to bring you down here.

818
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah.

819
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I guess you can call me

820
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
if you want to head back out or something.

821
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm sorry?

822
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Do you have to give her a call?

823
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, it's just got to work at one.

824
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So she said,

825
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
is you going to go out

826
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and just to write this letter

827
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
into the judge?

828
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah.

829
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, he got screwed over by his fucking lawyer.

830
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's got to be Mike Kretzmer.

831
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Mm-hmm.

832
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He went so far as to...

833
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He emailed Jim and Tammy

834
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
saying,

835
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I am Val's counsel.

836
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I am Val's attorney.

837
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm Val's attorney.

838
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm Val's attorney.

839
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Interesting.

840
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, because I saw your text this morning.

841
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I saw that.

842
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You know, he said he'd like to represent you,

843
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
but he's not, so...

844
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah, we had to fire him.

845
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

846
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He was very condescending.

847
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And there's something really wrong.

848
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You see, I thought it was in L.A.

849
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I mean, it's like a mafia.

850
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
They know each other

851
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and they do whatever

852
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the other person says.

853
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's very disturbing.

854
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They want to mess it up however you want,

855
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but you have to have it.

856
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's perfect.

857
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Thank you.

858
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Wonderful.

859
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
All right.

860
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, I tried to guess what this is all about.

861
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It says,

862
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
nothing to do with banking.

863
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay.

864
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And I think that's something to do with hacking.

865
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And the name is Emma.

866
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh, look.

867
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I think I got the honor of being here.

868
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You know what I mean?

869
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You know what I mean?

870
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You know what I mean?

871
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Well, I mean, to the third guest.

872
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

873
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
No, no, no.

874
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Another guest.

875
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Interesting.

876
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Who's the third guest?

877
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I think he's the fourth guest.

878
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
No, no, no.

879
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay.

880
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes.

881
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, there's a guest.

882
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's a match.

883
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's a match.

884
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's a problem.

885
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Cool.

886
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I guess, so,

887
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
what we're here for is mainly to see

888
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
how we can help you, right?

889
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Because we need to find out.

890
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So, you and I have talked,

891
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I've talked with Patty and Bowling

892
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
about it lately,

893
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
but you should probably

894
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
re-match a little bit about

895
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
what the situation is right now,

896
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
how the hearing went,

897
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and everything else.

898
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Just make sure that we're all on the same page.

899
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Because like I told you,

900
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
like, if we are going to be able to help,

901
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
we have to know how we can help

902
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and how best to help you.

903
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Okay.

904
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That way, we can go forward.

905
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But at the same time,

906
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
if you're going to help us,

907
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
you also have to know,

908
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
okay, well, is this going to be

909
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
dependent on something else?

910
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Right.

911
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, that's why,

912
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
why don't you just tell me

913
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
first what you want.

914
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And then I'll go from there.

915
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Well, I mean,

916
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the thing is like,

917
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm not going to tell you

918
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
what exactly we want.

919
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm telling you that right now.

920
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I've already told you,

921
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
on the phone,

922
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm giving you my word,

923
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
because you, Tim and Jami,

924
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
recommended you.

925
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I said,

926
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll help you if you need my help.

927
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No matter what.

928
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Even if it's,

929
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
even if it's not anything related

930
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
to you helping me,

931
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I will help you the best

932
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
in my ability.

933
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Okay.

934
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Just because of Tim and Jami,

935
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
because I date,

936
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
their word is very,

937
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
they carry a lot with me.

938
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It goes far with me.

939
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So I've already told you that,

940
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
so I'll stick with that.

941
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You don't have to worry about

942
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
anything too transactional with me

943
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
right now.

944
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay.

945
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
If you guys are coming out here

946
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
to help me,

947
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
that's great.

948
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay.

949
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'll tell you,

950
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
what do you need to know?

951
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The whole story from the beginning?

952
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yep.

953
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Different deal.

954
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay.

955
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Go.

956
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Um.

957
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Um.

958
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't even know where to start

959
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
from the beginning.

960
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Uh.

961
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Okay.

962
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So,

963
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
you don't know my story though.

964
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It doesn't really matter, does it?

965
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Um.

966
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You can't even trust it.

967
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You can't even trust it.

968
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, please don't read it.

969
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
David Ennerinches article.

970
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's terrible.

971
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Um.

972
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay.

973
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So Marie and I,

974
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm that,

975
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
you know,

976
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
you can't even trust it.

977
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You can't even trust it.

978
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You can't even trust it.

979
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You can't even trust it.

980
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Marie and I met,

981
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
uh,

982
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
because I thought she was a spy for my mom,

983
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and I thought she was spying on me.

984
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So I,

985
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
uh,

986
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
confronted her,

987
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and she was,

988
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
uh,

989
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
had a show in Australia

990
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
doing,

991
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
selling a bunch of,

992
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
uh,

993
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
she had a personal,

994
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
like her first cool show in Adeline,

995
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I think,

996
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
with her,

997
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Sydney.

998
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I don't remember.

999
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So,

1000
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
um,

1001
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
she ends up,

1002
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
she knows my mother,

1003
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
because my mother,

1004
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
um,

1005
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
she know that story, right?

1006
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So he killed himself,

1007
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and my mother needs something to do,

1008
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
after she,

1009
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
uh,

1010
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
robbed me and everyone else in the family

1011
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
of all our money.

1012
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Um,

1013
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
went to,

1014
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
back to,

1015
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
uh, art school in New York,

1016
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and,

1017
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
uh,

1018
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Marie was just about to leave her husband,

1019
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and she went to art school in New York at the same time.

1020
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So my mom's like 64,

1021
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Marie was like 34 at the same time,

1022
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
but they hit it off,

1023
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
became friends.

1024
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You know,

1025
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Marie actually stayed on my mom's house,

1026
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
she knows my sisters,

1027
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
she did like cocaine with my mother,

1028
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
which is weird.

1029
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You could imagine,

1030
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
with stories,

1031
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
it's very weird.

1032
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Um,

1033
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
anyway,

1034
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
so,

1035
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and not to incriminate me.

1036
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's a joke,

1037
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
you guys say.

1038
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Having coffee with friends.

1039
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Right, right.

1040
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So,

1041
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
um,

1042
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and then we hit it off,

1043
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and she came back to LA,

1044
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and she lived in LA fortunately,

1045
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and,

1046
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
uh,

1047
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and David needed somebody to,

1048
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
um,

1049
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and my mother's side was not talking,

1050
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and at this point,

1051
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I was still friends with David,

1052
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
David Unridge,

1053
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and he is someone on my mom's count,

1054
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and so I said,

1055
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
you know what,

1056
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I think I got the perfect person,

1057
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm gonna,

1058
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm gonna flip her,

1059
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and take her from my mom's side,

1060
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
bring her to our side,

1061
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
it's a good side of the force,

1062
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
right,

1063
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and I did,

1064
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
you know,

1065
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and I did,

1066
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and she became a source of the book,

1067
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and she told David

1068
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
all the blanks he,

1069
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
uh,

1070
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
was missing,

1071
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and we moved in together,

1072
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
you know,

1073
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
all my life,

1074
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I've been like a bachelor,

1075
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
you know,

1076
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
kind of spoiled brat,

1077
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
mostly too,

1078
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and my dad,

1079
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
kind of financed my life,

1080
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
so I,

1081
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I made music,

1082
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I had 36 albums in a single,

1083
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I had a lot of girlfriends,

1084
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I fucked around,

1085
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I went on tour,

1086
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I had fun,

1087
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you know,

1088
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and that all,

1089
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
went to zero,

1090
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and it all stopped,

1091
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
immediately,

1092
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and January 26, 2014,

1093
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and I learned,

1094
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I learned a lot since then,

1095
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
a lot of things have changed for me,

1096
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and I've never dated a girl

1097
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
with a kid,

1098
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and I was like,

1099
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
you know what,

1100
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I really love her,

1101
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and I really like this kid,

1102
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
so why the fuck not?

1103
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I mean,

1104
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
my father,

1105
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
my mom,

1106
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
when I was a kid,

1107
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
you know,

1108
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and,

1109
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
he's a good kid,

1110
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and it's not that,

1111
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I mean,

1112
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
it's hard to raise a kid,

1113
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
believe me,

1114
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was,

1115
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you know,

1116
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
especially when he's a good kid,

1117
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
you know,

1118
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
he's really happy,

1119
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
but, you know,

1120
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and like,

1121
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
most of that's really from me.

1122
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They say it's a much stronger love.

1123
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That you'll ever love,

1124
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
yeah,

1125
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
it's true,

1126
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
it's true,

1127
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
but I also have like,

1128
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm also not,

1129
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I mean,

1130
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm like the boyfriend,

1131
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
so I mean,

1132
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm the father figure,

1133
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
as well,

1134
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
but I guess I don't have the burden

1135
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
that Marie has,

1136
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and that's,

1137
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
like I could see hers,

1138
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
she is really upset

1139
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
over little things all the time.

1140
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm like,

1141
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
why are you getting so upset?

1142
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
She'll fuck you.

1143
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Anyway,

1144
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
we,

1145
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
we,

1146
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
everything was sort of going fine.

1147
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I got a bit depressed

1148
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
when Peggy died,

1149
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
a very close friend of mine

1150
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
died January 1st.

1151
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And now,

1152
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Is it?

1153
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
No,

1154
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
it's 2019,

1155
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you know,

1156
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
but,

1157
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
that's another story.

1158
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's a good story,

1159
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but a long story.

1160
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Neil Young,

1161
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
his wife,

1162
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Peggy,

1163
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Neil Young is a real dick,

1164
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
a real fucking asshole.

1165
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
When I was at the funeral,

1166
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
he stood up there on stage,

1167
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it looked like he had won,

1168
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
like Peggy had died,

1169
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and he got his girl,

1170
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
his daughter back,

1171
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
who was,

1172
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
he was,

1173
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
this,

1174
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
this strange from,

1175
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and all the money that Peggy took in divorce,

1176
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and he said,

1177
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
there's like,

1178
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I won,

1179
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I got it all back.

1180
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I had to leave early,

1181
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I don't know,

1182
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
about what I said.

1183
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The point of that story is

1184
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
because you need to know

1185
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
that Steve,

1186
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
so Steve Tolst,

1187
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
okay,

1188
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
he's an Australian,

1189
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and he is a writer.

1190
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
He won like a second prize

1191
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
in a beauty contest,

1192
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
you know,

1193
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
like a runner-up

1194
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
for the Booker Prize,

1195
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
but not even

1196
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
when the Booker Prize,

1197
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and he only did it

1198
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because his father

1199
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
is a very well-placed guy

1200
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
in Sydney,

1201
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and a very wealthy family

1202
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
of lawyers,

1203
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and they did

1204
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
whatever they could.

1205
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So,

1206
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
he's sort of like,

1207
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and I don't say

1208
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
it's just a little bit

1209
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
of the angry boyfriend,

1210
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
he's kind of,

1211
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
he's running the capacity,

1212
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
he's running sort of like,

1213
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
he's not the brightest guy around,

1214
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
but he can fool you

1215
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
into believing he is,

1216
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
you know,

1217
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and I think he did that

1218
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to Marie for a long time,

1219
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and when she sort of caught on

1220
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
what was really happening,

1221
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
she left.

1222
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But,

1223
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
when I met her,

1224
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
he was still emailing her

1225
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
20, 30 times a day,

1226
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
texting her,

1227
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
sorry,

1228
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
the equivalent,

1229
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and she thought she

1230
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
had to respond,

1231
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and I remember

1232
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
being in a car in like,

1233
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
2018,

1234
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm like,

1235
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
why are you responding to this?

1236
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Why are you doing this?

1237
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Like, every time you have

1238
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
an issue where you have to

1239
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
say, oh, you're going to be fine,

1240
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
she's like,

1241
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't know,

1242
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I just feel guilty if I don't.

1243
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm like,

1244
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
well, okay,

1245
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
we don't have to,

1246
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and then she was

1247
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
like, you're right,

1248
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I don't,

1249
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and then she stopped,

1250
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and that's when it all started.

1251
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So,

1252
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
he's a kind of guy,

1253
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I was telling Kim,

1254
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
would rather burn

1255
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
the world down

1256
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
than to

1257
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
allow her to leave him.

1258
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay,

1259
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and I never met these

1260
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
attached people before.

1261
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
This is new to me,

1262
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
right?

1263
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Like,

1264
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
first of all,

1265
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm dating a girl with a kid,

1266
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and now there's a boyfriend,

1267
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
like,

1268
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
the kind you see in

1269
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
freaking television shows,

1270
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
you know,

1271
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
it exists.

1272
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I didn't know.

1273
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I didn't know.

1274
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I thought she was like,

1275
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I thought Marie was over exaggerating.

1276
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm like,

1277
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
come on,

1278
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
can't it be that offensive?

1279
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
She shows me the best.

1280
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm like,

1281
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
wow,

1282
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
you know,

1283
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
you have to really be crazy.

1284
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So again,

1285
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
the reason,

1286
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
what you don't know,

1287
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is that when they first met,

1288
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
it was sort of normal.

1289
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
She was waiting for him to leave,

1290
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
but he stayed

1291
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and moved into her house.

1292
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Then he got sick,

1293
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and aneurysm in his back.

1294
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It did something to the spinal nerve,

1295
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and L4,

1296
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I don't know,

1297
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm not out of position,

1298
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
so I don't know exactly,

1299
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
but it severed the nerve,

1300
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
pinched the nerve.

1301
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It was something where it paralyzed.

1302
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Neck down,

1303
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
fully paralyzed.

1304
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
She,

1305
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Marie is such the type where,

1306
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
she actually wrote a letter to

1307
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Sarkozy saying,

1308
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I need your help,

1309
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
is that Australian,

1310
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and he even paid for his medical bills.

1311
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And Sarkozy fucking responded,

1312
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and said,

1313
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
okay.

1314
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah,

1315
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that's Marie.

1316
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So Sarkozy actually paid for his bills?

1317
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Sarkozy paid for his bills.

1318
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Probably started to write

1319
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Sarkozy for health and planning.

1320
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Right?

1321
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah,

1322
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
what am I doing here

1323
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
when I talk to Sarkozy?

1324
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
No.

1325
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But

1326
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
what's really weird

1327
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
is that Steve's father

1328
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
could have paid for it,

1329
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
but they didn't,

1330
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
because they were that type of people.

1331
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
They can get it for free,

1332
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
then they'll take it, right?

1333
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It doesn't matter that they're taking someone else's

1334
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
scholarship,

1335
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
someone else's

1336
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
fund for their thing,

1337
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
they don't care.

1338
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So Marie nursed him back to health

1339
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
after a couple years,

1340
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and he could walk with him.

1341
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Miracle,

1342
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
it was a 4% chance of walking,

1343
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
you walk.

1344
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh no,

1345
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
sorry,

1346
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
not 4% chance.

1347
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That was,

1348
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that was having Marlowe's 4% chance.

1349
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It was like a very low

1350
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
percent chance of walking,

1351
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
but he was up and walking.

1352
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But

1353
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
he would forever have to wear a catheter.

1354
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think it costs me back,

1355
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm not sure how long that lasted,

1356
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
but of course,

1357
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
the guy,

1358
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
no hard on,

1359
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
cannot get it up,

1360
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
no sex.

1361
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So Marie

1362
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
just was in her,

1363
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
she's very loyal,

1364
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and she was 22,

1365
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and she met him,

1366
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
very young and naive.

1367
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So,

1368
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
what am I doing?

1369
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I guess,

1370
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
can't,

1371
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
you know,

1372
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I have to stick with this guy.

1373
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You know,

1374
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
she did last as long as she could,

1375
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and his mind

1376
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and body deteriorated further and further,

1377
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and then she just left.

1378
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
She couldn't take it much,

1379
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
she left.

1380
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Now,

1381
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
between us,

1382
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
they separated in,

1383
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think 2013,

1384
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
but for the lawyers,

1385
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
it's 2018.

1386
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Just so you know,

1387
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
because she's,

1388
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you know,

1389
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
for the,

1390
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
you know,

1391
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't know any about divorce either,

1392
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
but the lawyer said,

1393
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
let's just say 2018.

1394
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay,

1395
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
so I don't know.

1396
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So,

1397
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
when,

1398
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I met him for the first time,

1399
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
he seemed,

1400
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I mean,

1401
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I was like,

1402
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
oh, hello,

1403
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
my name's Val,

1404
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm the guy that's fucking your wife.

1405
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
He's like,

1406
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
ah, ha, ha,

1407
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
very funny.

1408
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It was a joke,

1409
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and he laughed,

1410
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and he took it well.

1411
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
He did?

1412
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah.

1413
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
He took a chance.

1414
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I did,

1415
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I did.

1416
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Everyone else laughs,

1417
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
you know,

1418
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
but,

1419
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
he became more obsessive.

1420
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The text increased

1421
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
tremendously.

1422
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I mean,

1423
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
we're talking like 50 to 60,

1424
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
answering me,

1425
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
what are you doing?

1426
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't understand.

1427
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And they were like,

1428
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
really negative.

1429
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's all designed to make her hurt,

1430
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
feel like shit,

1431
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
feel guilty,

1432
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
you know,

1433
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
or feel sorry for him.

1434
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Every single one is designed for that.

1435
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I printed them all out,

1436
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
gave them to the lawyer.

1437
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's,

1438
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
just to read them,

1439
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
it's like weird.

1440
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You guys,

1441
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
it's a fun read,

1442
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
if you ever want to,

1443
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
if you're bored.

1444
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'll send it to you if you want.

1445
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But it's disturbing,

1446
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
too,

1447
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
because it's a sign of obsession,

1448
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and that's never going to end well,

1449
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
you know.

1450
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So,

1451
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
fast forward to a bunch of stuff,

1452
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
on April 10th,

1453
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
or,

1454
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
sorry,

1455
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
before April 10th,

1456
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
COVID hit,

1457
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and Marla had to be

1458
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
taught home,

1459
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
homeschooled now,

1460
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
so he had the logins

1461
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
to the computer,

1462
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
you know,

1463
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
such a nightmare at first.

1464
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It was such a nightmare.

1465
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh, man, yeah.

1466
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Trying to get him to do homework,

1467
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and he's lying,

1468
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
now he's lying all the time.

1469
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And this kid,

1470
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
he never lied.

1471
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
He like,

1472
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
was so honest and happy,

1473
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
he couldn't put him anywhere,

1474
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and he would start talking to everybody,

1475
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and everyone would be

1476
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
in trance by his conversation.

1477
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
He is a smart kid,

1478
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
he's so smart.

1479
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But now,

1480
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
he's lying.

1481
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I mean,

1482
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
why is he lying?

1483
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Is he trying to hide something?

1484
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He's depressed,

1485
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
he's something's wrong,

1486
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
he doesn't either,

1487
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
but Marie always blames Steve,

1488
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
no matter what,

1489
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
it's always Steve.

1490
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And I kind of learned

1491
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that she's,

1492
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you know,

1493
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
almost always right too,

1494
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
you know,

1495
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
because he comes,

1496
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
it's a 50-50 custody at this point.

1497
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Sorry,

1498
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
for a year,

1499
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
it was 50-50 custody.

1500
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Before that,

1501
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
it was 80-20,

1502
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Marie, okay?

1503
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But for the last year,

1504
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
they tried 50-50.

1505
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Steve says,

1506
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and I have a lot of records,

1507
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
saying I cannot take care

1508
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
of Marla for more than a week

1509
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
at a time.

1510
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
All he does

1511
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
is he sits in the little office,

1512
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and he writes the books.

1513
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
He works for screenwriting

1514
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
for some comedy TV show,

1515
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
it's not very funny.

1516
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Two police officers

1517
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
are detectives in a car

1518
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
the whole time.

1519
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Security?

1520
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Something security?

1521
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't know.

1522
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's not that good.

1523
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's not that good.

1524
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So that's why he's in the country.

1525
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Not Tim and Jamie.

1526
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I needed,

1527
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Marie wanted to divorce him,

1528
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
she's been wanting him

1529
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
for so long,

1530
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
but she can't,

1531
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
because,

1532
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
but because of the visa

1533
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
that she was on,

1534
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
she was tied to it,

1535
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
she could not work in America,

1536
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and she was trying to do,

1537
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
you know,

1538
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
she would still

1539
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
do some cash jobs,

1540
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
or she'd teach French,

1541
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
or art,

1542
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
to the mothers,

1543
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
to go to a school called Lila,

1544
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
it's a French,

1545
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
for French people.

1546
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And there's something

1547
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
we were going on about that

1548
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
school too,

1549
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
you guys should be aware of.

1550
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Very,

1551
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
something's off.

1552
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But,

1553
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
what was I saying?

1554
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Sorry,

1555
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you know that Lila,

1556
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
French school,

1557
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and it brought up,

1558
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
80, 20, 50, 50.

1559
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, the custody,

1560
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that's right.

1561
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah.

1562
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And then COVID.

1563
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's right.

1564
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah, she's,

1565
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
well, now Marie works in rehab.

1566
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
She works at arts,

1567
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
which is another crazy thing

1568
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
about DCFS.

1569
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
She works in rehab,

1570
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
which is randomly drug tested

1571
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
every week, right?

1572
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So,

1573
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but I'll get to that.

1574
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
She teaches art therapy

1575
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
to all these drug addicts.

1576
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
She's able to work,

1577
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and Marla's able to work,

1578
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and everything's going fine,

1579
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and then Steve,

1580
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
one day, comes over,

1581
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
because we're a day late,

1582
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
or there was some misinterpretation,

1583
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and this,

1584
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
something happened,

1585
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
someone didn't communicate

1586
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
with someone about Marla,

1587
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
one who was supposed to be picked up.

1588
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Steve knows to never come

1589
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
by place, or loft.

1590
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
He knows to never come by,

1591
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and we don't go to his place either.

1592
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's an unspoken rule.

1593
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
He comes over,

1594
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and he,

1595
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
he's wearing a mask

1596
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
that was white,

1597
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
but he drew,

1598
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and this was really weird,

1599
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I thought, he drew teeth.

1600
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He's a 50 year old man,

1601
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
okay, and he drew teeth

1602
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
on the mask.

1603
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He came over,

1604
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and I had a security camera,

1605
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
so I had the whole thing on tape.

1606
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It was wonderful,

1607
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
this is fucking hilarious.

1608
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But,

1609
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
he goes,

1610
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
he comes over,

1611
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and you know,

1612
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
you see pedestrians throw by,

1613
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and they're just normal people,

1614
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
when you can see someone going for a run,

1615
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and someone just walking the dog,

1616
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but then you see a slow,

1617
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
perambling,

1618
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
what the hell is this?

1619
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And it's, of course, Steve.

1620
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I mean, I don't know if he's high,

1621
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy.

1622
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But he makes it to the front door,

1623
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
he knocks,

1624
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
he blows up his one sleeve,

1625
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
he's preparing for something, obviously.

1626
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And,

1627
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
no, I don't,

1628
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I don't really see this in retrospect.

1629
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
At the time,

1630
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm upstairs having a joke

1631
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and laughing with Marla and Marie.

1632
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like, we're like on the floor laughing

1633
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
about word Al Jankiewicz,

1634
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
because Yoda,

1635
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
you know what I'm saying, Yoda?

1636
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Why Yoda?

1637
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yoda is great.

1638
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But Marla just learned it,

1639
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
so he was laughing.

1640
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And then the door is,

1641
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
someone's knocking the door,

1642
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and it's around five o'clock, I remember,

1643
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
because that's when Steve's always on time,

1644
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
perfectly.

1645
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And I'm like,

1646
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
what the fuck?

1647
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So I said,

1648
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'll go check,

1649
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and I open the door,

1650
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and I see Steve,

1651
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and Steve goes,

1652
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Marla,

1653
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Marla,

1654
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
he starts screaming for Marla.

1655
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Marie is so freaked out,

1656
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
she takes Marla,

1657
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and she hides in the bathroom.

1658
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's the only door in the loft as a lock,

1659
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and it's like,

1660
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
just the furthest,

1661
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
it's the furthest from the front door,

1662
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
actually, too.

1663
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And I was like,

1664
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
wow,

1665
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
like she really,

1666
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
she was fucking scared.

1667
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And I don't want her scared,

1668
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
it's just like a little,

1669
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
you know,

1670
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
puny guy can barely walk,

1671
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
so I,

1672
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
but he starts,

1673
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
he says,

1674
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I want him to,

1675
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm here to pick up Marla,

1676
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and I say,

1677
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
no, you're not,

1678
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
you cannot be here,

1679
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
you're not supposed to be here.

1680
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What are you doing here?

1681
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You gotta go.

1682
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
No, I'm picking up Marla,

1683
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
it's five o'clock,

1684
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
look, just,

1685
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
let me put on some shoes,

1686
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and some socks,

1687
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and a jacket,

1688
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and I was,

1689
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I wasn't fully dressed,

1690
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I was like,

1691
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
sweatpants,

1692
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and shirt.

1693
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Let me come outside,

1694
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and I'll,

1695
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and I'll talk to you about it.

1696
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He said,

1697
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
well,

1698
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
there's not much to talk about,

1699
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
but okay,

1700
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
so he goes back,

1701
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I close the door,

1702
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and now,

1703
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
what I learned later,

1704
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
is when I closed the door,

1705
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
he whipped out his cell phone,

1706
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and he opened up an app,

1707
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and he starts flipping through porn.

1708
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Normal, right?

1709
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
No, not,

1710
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
very odd behavior.

1711
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I was like,

1712
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
what the fuck,

1713
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
but it wasn't like porn porn,

1714
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
it was like dating site porn,

1715
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
with the couples.

1716
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It was fucking weird,

1717
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
right?

1718
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
To come over to the house,

1719
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
not gonna be angry at me,

1720
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
because he was kind of like,

1721
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
his voice was raised,

1722
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm telling you,

1723
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
like a really brief version,

1724
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
but then just like,

1725
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
not chill out,

1726
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
like,

1727
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
it was very strange.

1728
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I tell him,

1729
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
look, it's okay,

1730
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm gonna handle it,

1731
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and Marla says,

1732
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
you know what,

1733
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
my dad,

1734
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
he just needs to be reassured,

1735
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and Marla's like,

1736
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
no, no, no,

1737
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
no reassuring,

1738
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
just stay here with me in the bathtub,

1739
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and like,

1740
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
you guys are just gonna be fine,

1741
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm just gonna talk to him,

1742
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and you'll leave.

1743
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So I get dressed,

1744
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I open the door,

1745
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and the door opens up this way,

1746
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and then as my door,

1747
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
as the door's open,

1748
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
he comes in,

1749
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
shoulder,

1750
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
right here,

1751
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
to break my,

1752
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
my,

1753
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
my grip,

1754
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
on the door,

1755
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
but I,

1756
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
he's not that strong,

1757
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
so I,

1758
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
he doesn't break my grip,

1759
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
he just makes me upset,

1760
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
so I grab,

1761
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and I pull him out,

1762
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and he doesn't quite hit the car,

1763
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
his first reaction is,

1764
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
oh, my back,

1765
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
right,

1766
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
like a,

1767
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
sort of like a,

1768
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
childish thing,

1769
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
very strange,

1770
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
for a 50-year-old man,

1771
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and I said,

1772
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
oh, shut the fuck up,

1773
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and now you can hear me,

1774
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the profanity's out,

1775
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm like,

1776
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
are you stupid,

1777
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
are you that stupid,

1778
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I mean,

1779
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
to fight a,

1780
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
you know,

1781
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and I said,

1782
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
this is California,

1783
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
this is,

1784
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
you know,

1785
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
good thing I'm not like California,

1786
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
because,

1787
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
you know,

1788
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
they carry guns,

1789
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
like,

1790
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
people can have guns,

1791
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't even have a gun,

1792
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
you know,

1793
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
things like this,

1794
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and then he,

1795
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
he,

1796
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I said,

1797
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
look,

1798
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
this is on camera,

1799
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
then he's like,

1800
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
you just lost,

1801
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
you just lost the divorce,

1802
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
you just lost everything,

1803
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
you fucked up man,

1804
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
you gotta go now,

1805
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
he's like,

1806
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm not leaving,

1807
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
so,

1808
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
short version is,

1809
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I throw him out to the sidewalk,

1810
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I push him until he's in the,

1811
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
it's still private property,

1812
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
but I just sort of say,

1813
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
now you're in the streets,

1814
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
you can leave us alone though,

1815
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and I tell you,

1816
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I will,

1817
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and I made him a promise,

1818
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I will bring Marlo out,

1819
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
you can say hello to Marlo,

1820
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I will bring him out,

1821
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and you have my word on that,

1822
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
but you have to be by your car,

1823
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
you cannot be on our property,

1824
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and you can agree to do it,

1825
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
go to his car,

1826
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
so Marlo,

1827
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
please do me a favor,

1828
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
can you come out with me,

1829
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
but just don't let go of my hand,

1830
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and Marlo says,

1831
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
okay,

1832
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and he does not let go of my hand

1833
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
all the time,

1834
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
because I know he's gonna try and steal him,

1835
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and he tried twice,

1836
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
the whole time,

1837
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I recorded everything on my phone,

1838
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
it's all,

1839
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
it's all there,

1840
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and the video camera,

1841
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
so when that incident occurred,

1842
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Marie and I sat down and talked,

1843
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and she said,

1844
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the deterioration has gone severe,

1845
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
this is a line that's crossed,

1846
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and Marie's in the middle of the forest,

1847
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and to cross this line,

1848
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
in the middle of the forest,

1849
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
is very stupid,

1850
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
okay,

1851
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
so that means the brain has deteriorated

1852
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
further than we even imagined,

1853
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
so Marie is very concerned,

1854
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and she's like,

1855
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm not giving Marlo back down,

1856
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
so she holds on to Marlo

1857
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
for the last five months,

1858
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
so we had Marlo,

1859
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and we were like,

1860
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
it's fun to have like,

1861
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
now we're like a family,

1862
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
for five months,

1863
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
we found Marlo,

1864
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
you know,

1865
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
we all got to know each other,

1866
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and Marlo,

1867
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
you know,

1868
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
it's really funny,

1869
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
it was nice.

1870
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
How long have you been living with Marlo?

1871
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Two and a half years now,

1872
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but you know,

1873
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
you see Marlo every other week.

1874
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Like five months?

1875
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah, yeah,

1876
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
it was a lot at first,

1877
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
especially for me,

1878
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but I got used to it,

1879
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
it wasn't,

1880
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it wasn't so,

1881
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
you know,

1882
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I thought it was going to be even worse for me,

1883
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
but you know,

1884
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
expect the worst.

1885
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It's a good day,

1886
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
it could go any way.

1887
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah, it's true, it's true,

1888
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
but you know,

1889
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and we'd see Steven,

1890
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and the fear,

1891
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
see the fear and the lying,

1892
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and we'd try to teach him to not lie,

1893
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
like he starts lying,

1894
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
like he talks,

1895
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I said,

1896
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Marlo,

1897
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
why are these lies?

1898
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And we know where they come from,

1899
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
because Steve,

1900
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
this is how Steve talks,

1901
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
he lies constantly,

1902
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
he's always,

1903
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
he's always,

1904
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and we felt like we made some progress,

1905
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
you know,

1906
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
he was,

1907
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
he had more self-confidence,

1908
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
like he was afraid of dancing,

1909
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and eight year old,

1910
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
afraid of dancing,

1911
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
because he's self-conscious,

1912
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
he's fucking silly,

1913
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
so we started dancing more

1914
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
to make him less self-conscious,

1915
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and we did these kung fu outfits,

1916
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
so we pretended we were kung fu fighting,

1917
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
you know,

1918
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
saw him kung fu fighting,

1919
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
he loves it,

1920
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
so his confidence is back,

1921
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
he's happy,

1922
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and he fucking said to me,

1923
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
three days before this,

1924
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
all went to shit,

1925
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
he said,

1926
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
well,

1927
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I wish you were my father,

1928
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
he said to me,

1929
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and it broke my heart,

1930
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
it broke my heart,

1931
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I mean,

1932
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I felt great and warm,

1933
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
but it also broke my heart,

1934
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
you know,

1935
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and I know that feeling,

1936
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
because I grew up in foster care,

1937
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
you know,

1938
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I know that feeling,

1939
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I've been to two different,

1940
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
different families,

1941
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and different mothers,

1942
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
and different fathers,

1943
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I had two brothers once in foster care,

1944
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
you know,

1945
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
you know, home.

1946
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You remember it pretty well?

1947
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah, yeah,

1948
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and one I don't,

1949
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
two I remember pretty well,

1950
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
the last one I remember very well,

1951
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
because there was,

1952
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
there wasn't the horrible system

1953
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
that you hear about,

1954
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
this is a nice happy Jewish family,

1955
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
a loving family,

1956
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
they're like good people,

1957
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
you know,

1958
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
even in Chicago,

1959
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
in Cook County,

1960
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Carol and Larry Payless,

1961
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I remember,

1962
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
it's not like the shoe store,

1963
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
it's Payless,

1964
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I said,

1965
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
oh,

1966
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
sometimes for a different climate,

1967
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
it's a lot like a craft shoe,

1968
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I see.

1969
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah,

1970
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I got lucky,

1971
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I got lucky,

1972
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
because I heard the stories,

1973
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
you know,

1974
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
so,

1975
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
it's still,

1976
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
it's still in the middle, yeah.

1977
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
No, nothing,

1978
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
there's fighting,

1979
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and Steve is using this now,

1980
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
as a tool in the divorce,

1981
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
everything that just happened is,

1982
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
weaponizing DCFS,

1983
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
he just did it,

1984
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and it forgot it limited capacity,

1985
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I know that it wasn't him,

1986
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
it's gotta be the lawyers,

1987
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
his lawyers are pretty smart,

1988
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
because he's got money,

1989
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
he's got like seven lawyers,

1990
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
you know,

1991
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
you have one guy

1992
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
that barely leaves his office,

1993
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
we do most of the work,

1994
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Marie and I.

1995
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Anyway,

1996
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
so Marie and I are like,

1997
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
we've gone through two cleaning ladies,

1998
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
one live in the brewery,

1999
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and one girl,

2000
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
she's great,

2001
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
she was like too cute for me,

2002
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
because,

2003
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
why is she doing it?

2004
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Marie,

2005
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
why is she doing it?

2006
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm not staring at her,

2007
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
why does she have to worry

2008
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
about these tight pants?

2009
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm like,

2010
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
no, I didn't ask her,

2011
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
it's not my fault,

2012
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and then one day,

2013
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
she's like,

2014
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
you know what,

2015
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I don't want to clean,

2016
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I want to sing,

2017
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I want to make music,

2018
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm like, okay,

2019
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
go make some music,

2020
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
so she quit,

2021
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
so we start cleaning,

2022
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and in Richard,

2023
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
you know,

2024
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Marla gets in trouble,

2025
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
we're like,

2026
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
oh,

2027
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
you gotta do the dishes,

2028
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you know,

2029
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
you have to wipe and clean,

2030
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
and he doesn't like that either,

2031
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
so we thought,

2032
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
why not do,

2033
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
get a nanny slash,

2034
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
a housekeeper,

2035
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
okay,

2036
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
somebody can do both,

2037
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
watch Marla,

2038
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
we can have some time alone,

2039
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and they can clean the fucking house.

2040
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So we do put the feelers out,

2041
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Marie puts them out

2042
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
on some next door,

2043
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
it's a couple other websites.

2044
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I ask everybody,

2045
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I know,

2046
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
oh,

2047
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
sorry,

2048
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I forgot,

2049
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I almost forgot Patel.

2050
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Patel is a labor,

2051
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
one,

2052
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
two,

2053
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
three,

2054
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
three doors down,

2055
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
four doors down,

2056
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I thought she'd just moved in,

2057
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
in like July,

2058
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
or sorry,

2059
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
mid June,

2060
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'd never seen her before,

2061
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but all of a sudden,

2062
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
she's there,

2063
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
everywhere,

2064
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
very loud and boisterous,

2065
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and she,

2066
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
outside,

2067
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
look,

2068
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
at our place,

2069
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
there's a little park

2070
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
across the way,

2071
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and Marla always hangs out there,

2072
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
and so everyone,

2073
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
sort of,

2074
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the brewery,

2075
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
the brewery,

2076
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
artist loft,

2077
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
it's like an artist community,

2078
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
so it's a campus,

2079
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
more or less,

2080
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and it's just 300 lofts,

2081
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
with a whole bunch of it,

2082
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
with six or 900 people in it,

2083
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
it's a different spot,

2084
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
so everyone hangs out

2085
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
in the sort of park areas,

2086
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
where we are,

2087
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
because it's closest to us.

2088
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
She says,

2089
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
she saw him in the park,

2090
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and she showed him his jewelry,

2091
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and he said,

2092
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
oh, I want to make this,

2093
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
just some jewelry,

2094
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and I was like,

2095
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
you want to make crystal jewelry?

2096
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
He's like,

2097
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
yes,

2098
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I want to make crystal jewelry.

2099
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Like, okay, Marla,

2100
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
you can make some crystal jewelry.

2101
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So we take him over there,

2102
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and she seems sane, right?

2103
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I know something's off,

2104
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
you know,

2105
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I mean,

2106
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I can sense it,

2107
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I know something's wrong,

2108
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
but I figure maybe this is like,

2109
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
she's in a,

2110
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
just got her parents' house,

2111
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
or she's moving,

2112
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
trying to make her life,

2113
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
or start a new world.

2114
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I mean,

2115
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
there's no way she's making money

2116
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
selling crystal jewelry, okay?

2117
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It's,

2118
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
first of all,

2119
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
it's shitty jewelry,

2120
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
no one's buying it,

2121
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and it's way too expensive.

2122
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's not $4,500 a month,

2123
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
on that place.

2124
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I know what she's paying too.

2125
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So,

2126
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I figure there's some parents

2127
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
paying for it,

2128
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
or something,

2129
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
or maybe a brother,

2130
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
definitely not a sugar daddy type,

2131
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
because she's the most unattractive

2132
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
woman I've ever seen.

2133
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Like,

2134
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
you see her,

2135
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and you're like,

2136
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
whoa,

2137
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
okay,

2138
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and it's unfortunate for her,

2139
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but it is true.

2140
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So,

2141
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
anyway,

2142
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
she,

2143
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
we brought her over,

2144
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and we approved

2145
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
for like two hours a day.

2146
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
We thought that couldn't be,

2147
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
literally,

2148
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
you can walk in 10 seconds

2149
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and get to her house,

2150
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
or something.

2151
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's like,

2152
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
there's no danger,

2153
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
you know?

2154
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And Miles said,

2155
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
please, please,

2156
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
can I have that crystal jewelry, please?

2157
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Okay,

2158
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
yes,

2159
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and we get two hours to ourselves now.

2160
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So,

2161
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
we're happy.

2162
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So,

2163
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
for five days,

2164
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and he makes crystal jewelry.

2165
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
He comes back for lunch.

2166
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
He eats with us.

2167
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Sometimes,

2168
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Marie brings them lunch.

2169
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Sometimes,

2170
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'll go over there

2171
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and just see what's going on.

2172
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Everything's friendly and copicetic.

2173
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You can always,

2174
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
she's no problem.

2175
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
She's a talker.

2176
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
She likes to jab her

2177
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
about herself.

2178
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
She will not ask you anything

2179
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
about how you are,

2180
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
where you're from,

2181
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
or anything.

2182
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
She'll just tell you everything

2183
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
she knows about everybody.

2184
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Gossip,

2185
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
gossip, gossip.

2186
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
People live like that.

2187
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah,

2188
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
yeah.

2189
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's,

2190
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
well,

2191
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it's because that's what she thinks

2192
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
her value is,

2193
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and that's why we're,

2194
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
you know,

2195
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
it's very,

2196
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I understand it,

2197
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
but,

2198
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
but I mentioned,

2199
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Marlo,

2200
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
like,

2201
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
making crafts.

2202
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Anything,

2203
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and we found someone,

2204
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
like,

2205
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'll talk to him, too.

2206
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And that was like,

2207
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you know,

2208
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
it was so,

2209
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
it was interesting,

2210
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
but he loved it.

2211
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And he even said,

2212
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
down,

2213
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
down Marlo,

2214
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
bye,

2215
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
have you liked my whole life?

2216
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I've already made crystal jewelry.

2217
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Your whole life,

2218
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
figures on.

2219
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
He's like,

2220
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
it's a huge revelation,

2221
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
yeah.

2222
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
All right, Marlo,

2223
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
you go for it.

2224
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Of course,

2225
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
he got bored with it,

2226
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
you know,

2227
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
four days later.

2228
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But on Saturday,

2229
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Patil decided to sell the jewelry

2230
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
that she had been making with Marlo.

2231
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So,

2232
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
they go and they set up

2233
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
a thing in the park,

2234
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
like,

2235
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
just a table,

2236
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and all the people from

2237
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
the community come over

2238
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and they see Marlo,

2239
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and he's fucking adorable,

2240
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
selling jewelry,

2241
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
so people buy jewelry.

2242
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Of course,

2243
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I buy most of it,

2244
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
you know,

2245
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
so,

2246
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and I have to buy some Patil's jewelry, too,

2247
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
because it looks bad,

2248
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
but she's not really selling any.

2249
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So,

2250
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I buy some of her,

2251
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
so I spend like 250 bucks

2252
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
on this useless jewelry

2253
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
that's already broken,

2254
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
right?

2255
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Um,

2256
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Steve is $250.

2257
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I don't know.

2258
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
No,

2259
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
no,

2260
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I've not,

2261
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
but it's like 30 pieces,

2262
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
you know,

2263
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
it's ridiculous.

2264
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah,

2265
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
you don't need it,

2266
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
trust me.

2267
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It's not necessary.

2268
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But,

2269
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
but Steve,

2270
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I invite Steve,

2271
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
because I'm a nice guy.

2272
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So,

2273
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm like,

2274
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Steve would like to see this.

2275
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
His son is making money

2276
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
on something he created

2277
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
on his own.

2278
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
He's better than with his first $20.

2279
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So,

2280
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
he's ever earned.

2281
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Steve would like to see this.

2282
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I think it would be a good idea.

2283
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And Marie's like,

2284
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
no.

2285
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I say,

2286
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
come on,

2287
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
let him,

2288
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
he's got to,

2289
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
he'll enjoy this.

2290
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Because we give him visits every week

2291
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
or whenever he wants to,

2292
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
well,

2293
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
not whenever,

2294
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
basically once a week,

2295
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
but whenever he wants to talk tomorrow,

2296
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
we let him talk,

2297
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
unless tomorrow does not want to talk

2298
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and not as often.

2299
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And he does not want to accept that.

2300
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Um,

2301
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
so,

2302
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I invite him over

2303
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and he comes over

2304
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
and,

2305
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
um,

2306
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and,

2307
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
oh, shit.

2308
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Um,

2309
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I forgot I'm working today too,

2310
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
but it's okay.

2311
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I put on an option

2312
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
because I don't have to worry about it

2313
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
till next week.

2314
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Um,

2315
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
so,

2316
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
he comes over

2317
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and he's

2318
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
instantly in the mood changes.

2319
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You'll,

2320
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
if you ever meet him,

2321
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
you'll see for yourself.

2322
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You know,

2323
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
it's one of those people,

2324
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
everything's sort of down,

2325
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
now I'm depressing

2326
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and self-conscious.

2327
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You know,

2328
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
because that's what he,

2329
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
that's what he emulates.

2330
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Um,

2331
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
he seems somewhat immune

2332
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
to it right now,

2333
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
but he won't be in the future.

2334
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I know it.

2335
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I could see it happen.

2336
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Um,

2337
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
he asked Patille

2338
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
for her number.

2339
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Steve.

2340
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Steve does.

2341
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Which I thought was strange.

2342
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Um,

2343
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
but not too strange.

2344
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Marie said

2345
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
he never asked people

2346
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
for her number.

2347
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This is not a good idea.

2348
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Okay.

2349
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And I said,

2350
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
well,

2351
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'll trust you.

2352
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Um,

2353
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
later that night,

2354
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Patille,

2355
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
uh,

2356
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Marie and I are,

2357
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
uh, walking.

2358
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
For some reason,

2359
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
we didn't walk to the,

2360
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
now we weren't doing the laundry,

2361
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
we had to walk past the park.

2362
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I can't remember why.

2363
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Um,

2364
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and we see Patille

2365
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and three other girls

2366
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
sitting in the park

2367
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
by candlelight talking.

2368
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And I go,

2369
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
hey,

2370
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
nice to see you guys.

2371
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
We're going back,

2372
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
going to bed,

2373
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
cause I had to wake up early

2374
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
for some reason.

2375
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Um,

2376
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I can't remember why.

2377
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I had to wake up early.

2378
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I was upset at Marie

2379
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
for making me stay up so late.

2380
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You know,

2381
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I was like,

2382
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I had to,

2383
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
he promised me

2384
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
to get to bed before,

2385
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and I had to do extra shit

2386
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
for something.

2387
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So she says,

2388
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
okay,

2389
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
don't worry,

2390
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
let's just have a quick talk

2391
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
with Patille

2392
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
and talk about the day.

2393
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So,

2394
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
you know,

2395
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
okay,

2396
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
fine.

2397
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But that quick talk with Patille

2398
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
means she's going to talk

2399
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
to you at you for an hour.

2400
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You know,

2401
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and of course,

2402
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'm,

2403
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and Marielett does it,

2404
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
so I'm the one that says,

2405
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
okay,

2406
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
enough,

2407
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I've got to go to sleep.

2408
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Right?

2409
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm going to have to be the asshole.

2410
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So I say,

2411
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
okay, fine.

2412
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
She comes into our place

2413
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
for the first time.

2414
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
In our entrance living room, we have a loft, there's an upstairs, back room, there's a whole bunch of fucking space.

2415
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And I'm like, okay, great, let's just go outside and smoke a cigarette and have a go.

2416
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
She says, okay.

2417
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Go outside and we're underneath now my surveillance camera, okay?

2418
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And I have a 30-day fucking break point.

2419
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Marie is typing a letter now to send to LogiCircle to get this fucking tape because this will change everything.

2420
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Patille and we're smoking a cigarette and Patille goes on a tirade about how much she sees evil in Steve.

2421
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I looked in his eyes and all I saw was pure evil.

2422
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You know, like they're really dramatic.

2423
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.

2424
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
She's like really, she gets in my face like, I don't really, I got in his eyes and I saw nothing.

2425
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It was blank. It was evil.

2426
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I said, no, Patille, what you saw was emptiness. There's just nothing in there.

2427
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
He's not very smart.

2428
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
She was, no, no, no, it was evil.

2429
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
This was our conversation for like a good 15 minutes, right?

2430
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So not only are we confident that Patille hates Steve, you know, that she's not going to sell us out or do anything stupid.

2431
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
We were like, okay, she's, you know, we believe her.

2432
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
But, you know, I don't realize and I'm stupid because I forgot this is classic bipolar.

2433
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
That's what I picked up on.

2434
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
This woman is fucking classic bipolar.

2435
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And I've seen this so many times and I was dumb to not listen to my instinct that first day when I knew something was wrong.

2436
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I didn't know what it was.

2437
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I didn't think about it hard enough.

2438
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I think that's where I fucked up because that's what she is.

2439
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And now I see it because they flip one extreme to the next and that's exactly what happened.

2440
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Now in her report, she says she reached out to Steve via Instagram.

2441
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Not true.

2442
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
They have, she's got a phone number.

2443
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Okay.

2444
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:05,000
She wrote a report because we stopped seeing her after this because also there was something she was fucking dancing naked with Marlowe, supposedly.

2445
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Marlowe says she was dancing, but she may or may or not have been naked.

2446
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So Marlowe doesn't really understand.

2447
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
He's going either way.

2448
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Right.

2449
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So I don't know what that means with Marlowe, but I don't like it.

2450
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
He said he felt uncomfortable.

2451
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
He tried not to look.

2452
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
All he said, all I wanted to do was finish making the jewelry and she wanted to dance.

2453
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So that was enough for us to think this is enough of this.

2454
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Okay.

2455
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
We put him in camp the next day.

2456
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
He goes to a beach day camp for the next two weeks.

2457
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Now we don't hear from Patel for a long time.

2458
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
We think something's wrong.

2459
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Why is she like say hello?

2460
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
We don't see because she's not voice person friendly.

2461
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then we get hit with Steve's lawyers.

2462
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Like a dossier.

2463
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
They send like a thing saying here are the witness statements I have.

2464
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Why yours is a terrible person.

2465
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Here's why I'm great.

2466
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Not quite enough to do.

2467
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It's like an aggregate.

2468
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, summary of what she wanted and other people saying that me is a terrible person.

2469
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I want to say July 30th approximately July 30th.

2470
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So we see this and what we read is so fucking outrageously crazy.

2471
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:37,000
She said that Marlowe is walking around without a shirt barefoot and is combing through garbage for fucking food.

2472
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Seriously.

2473
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
He's going through dumpster for food.

2474
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And he says Marie is doing the same thing.

2475
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Or sorry, she says Marie is doing the same thing.

2476
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And then she says that Marie is walking around itching and scratching with sores all over her body.

2477
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
A classic junkie.

2478
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
She named every single drug in the world from fucking crystal meth that PCP did.

2479
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Some exotic crazy shit.

2480
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You remember in the heart of, you know.

2481
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
She says that there is a secret hidden room in her loft where all the drugs are stored in the paraphernalia.

2482
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Okay.

2483
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:16,000
She says I have 40, I'm not exaggerating, 40 to 50 cell phones scattered on the tables.

2484
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Okay.

2485
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Not fucking exaggerating.

2486
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And it's even worse.

2487
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
They're worse crazy shit.

2488
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But those are the ones I remember right now.

2489
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And we're like what the fuck.

2490
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You know, and immediately I think that Steve paid her.

2491
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
He had to pay her.

2492
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
But this is before I figured out the bipolar thing.

2493
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
What is the lawyer asking for?

2494
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
They want nothing.

2495
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
The lawyer said nothing.

2496
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
This is like a tactic.

2497
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
At this point you guys are full custody.

2498
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Well, see the custody arrangement as far as I understand it.

2499
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Again, I'm not a lawyer and I've never been through it.

2500
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
But since they're still married they both have equal rights to Marla.

2501
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
But no one has any, there are no rules set.

2502
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So it was a verbal agreement to say 50-50 for a year.

2503
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So when Marie said no 50-50 it was perfectly legal for her to do that.

2504
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And then she felt bad and she thought well maybe I should give him to,

2505
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
and also we could want it some time alone after a couple months or like,

2506
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
maybe we should give him to Steve for like a month,

2507
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
or sorry, for a week.

2508
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And then our lawyer said no.

2509
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Because there was no rule to stop him from keeping Marla.

2510
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
You know, just as you did he can do the same.

2511
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So we're like okay, so we keep him.

2512
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So when we see this thing from Utila it just freaks us out.

2513
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Like what the fuck.

2514
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And then DCFS comes over.

2515
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And I never heard of DCFS.

2516
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I don't know what the acronym stood for.

2517
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm sure I was visited by them as a child.

2518
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Because it seems like I remember something.

2519
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I did have a social worker I remember.

2520
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But the first woman that came over was named Priscilla.

2521
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And she was very nice.

2522
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
She came over and she, I let her in which is stupid.

2523
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And I realized now you should never let them in if they ever come to your house.

2524
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's a thing you can take.

2525
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
They can never take away a child if you don't let them in.

2526
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
That's what I was told by Laura.

2527
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
But she came in.

2528
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
She viewed the house.

2529
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
It was safe.

2530
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It was loving.

2531
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It was fun.

2532
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It was a good fucking home.

2533
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And she reported that.

2534
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Okay.

2535
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Now Marie said to her in her interview that there was an incident that she was worried about.

2536
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And I remember very well.

2537
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
We came home from shopping one day.

2538
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And Marlo just starts telling us like a confession.

2539
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
This crazy story about touching penises at the Mark and Bobax house.

2540
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
These people that sort of turned on Marie.

2541
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
They were friends of Marie.

2542
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And then some reason they were not.

2543
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
They just turned and then chose Steve's side.

2544
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Because people would need divorce.

2545
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
People would pick sides.

2546
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's shitty.

2547
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
People are fucking shitty.

2548
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You call someone a friend.

2549
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I mean, it really hurt her.

2550
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It really hurt her.

2551
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And the things they said were so fucking ridiculous and stupid.

2552
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Anyway, it's the...

2553
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
What was the point of that?

2554
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Sorry.

2555
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I need some more coffee.

2556
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I'm talking too much about coffee.

2557
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Okay.

2558
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So what was it just before that?

2559
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Oh, DCLA.

2560
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So what comes to the house?

2561
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
She says, are you willing to take drugs to us?

2562
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And we say, yes, you're willing to take drugs to us.

2563
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Great.

2564
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
We don't hear back from her for about three or four days.

2565
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Actually, we've never heard back from her.

2566
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That was the last we saw at Priscilla.

2567
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Next thing we know, police are at the door.

2568
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
This is actually the second time police came.

2569
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
They came before Priscilla came.

2570
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And then they came.

2571
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Then Priscilla and then the police came again.

2572
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And then...

2573
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
No, this is Sabah Abta.

2574
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And Erasmo...

2575
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Aguilera.

2576
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Aguilera.

2577
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Not Aguilera, but Aguilera without the A.

2578
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Those are not the police?

2579
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Those are not the police.

2580
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
These are more DCFS.

2581
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
DCFS?

2582
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah.

2583
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And now it's 10.30 at night and they're coming knocking door at 10.30 at night.

2584
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And so, Marie's not home.

2585
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
She's at Amy's.

2586
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And she's all under your camera.

2587
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
She'll put it on YouTube or something like that.

2588
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And they are...

2589
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You know, first they wake up Marlon.

2590
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
They're banging on the door.

2591
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And Marlon was asleep.

2592
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I was asleep.

2593
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Because I woke up fucking early to the trade options.

2594
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
You know, like 6 o'clock, 6.30.

2595
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
The market's open at 6.30.

2596
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I have to be awake and ready at 6.30 a.m.

2597
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So, you know, I'm half asleep.

2598
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And Marlon's like,

2599
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Someone's at the door.

2600
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Someone's at the door.

2601
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm like, Marlon, why aren't you asleep?

2602
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You're supposed to be asleep.

2603
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
They woke me up.

2604
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
They woke me up.

2605
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's okay.

2606
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So I go out and I open the door.

2607
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And I see...

2608
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And I say, where's DCFS?

2609
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
We're going to talk to you.

2610
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm like, I just spoke to you guys.

2611
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You were just here, you know?

2612
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And he's like, well, you got another call.

2613
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And I'm like, fucking...

2614
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And I know it's Patel calling every day.

2615
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Patel and Steve's together calling every day.

2616
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Just to fuck with us.

2617
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You see where they can get.

2618
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I know it.

2619
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
You know?

2620
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And they know it too.

2621
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So I'm like, you know, I'm just sort of sick of it.

2622
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I don't really want to do this anymore.

2623
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But I talk to them.

2624
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
We have a conversation.

2625
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'm very friendly.

2626
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You know, I'm not...

2627
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I don't give them any shit.

2628
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And they just...

2629
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I don't remember legally if they...

2630
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
If I invited them or they just walked in the house.

2631
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So they ended up getting in the house.

2632
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I don't remember saying, yeah, go ahead, please.

2633
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Come in for another round.

2634
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But they did.

2635
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And they did the rounds.

2636
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And we joked and we laughed.

2637
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Now, here's...

2638
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
No.

2639
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
This is where I...

2640
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
We broke down.

2641
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Marie and I have been doing this for three days.

2642
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Like, nonstop.

2643
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Working on this thing that you guys sent.

2644
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You know, breaking every single word by word,

2645
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
every line by line.

2646
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Where the lies are and what we can prove.

2647
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
We have documentary evidence for it when we don't.

2648
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Right?

2649
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
For example, she says, I knocked on the door

2650
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
and took about ten minutes to come to the door.

2651
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It took two minutes and thirty-two seconds.

2652
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Okay?

2653
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Two minutes and thirty-two fucking seconds.

2654
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
She says, we went through the house.

2655
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
There was no food in the refrigerator.

2656
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It was scarce.

2657
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
We had just ordered about three hundred and fifty-four hundred dollars

2658
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
from Amazon delivery.

2659
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Fresh, direct.

2660
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
To come fucking two guys full of...

2661
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
car full of food.

2662
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It was overflowing.

2663
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We made jokes.

2664
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I joked them.

2665
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I said, look, ha!

2666
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Guess you can't say where you're going.

2667
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
So we're starving him.

2668
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And we all laughed about it.

2669
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
In the report, it says, scarce.

2670
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Those are just, like, too little things.

2671
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
No, I'm not even getting into the big ones.

2672
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
It was delivered the next day.

2673
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
No, it was there.

2674
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
It was already there.

2675
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
The night before, we had got ordered it.

2676
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And we had packed up the fridge and the pantries.

2677
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
All right?

2678
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It was like, what the fuck?

2679
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
We couldn't believe what we were reading.

2680
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And if you read that thing, the first fourteen, fifteen pages are like,

2681
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
okay, fine.

2682
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So it's normal.

2683
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Nothing's wrong here.

2684
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And then we become, like, the worst people you've ever heard.

2685
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It's like fucking crazy shit.

2686
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And somehow, I don't give her the number.

2687
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
She has Tim's number.

2688
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
How the fuck does she get Tim's number?

2689
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And she says, and there's a little note at the end,

2690
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
because she's trying to discredit me as much as she can.

2691
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And you can see that it's really hard.

2692
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Worse than David Enridge did at The New York Times.

2693
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Like, really come after me.

2694
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
But I don't understand.

2695
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I'm what I did to anger her.

2696
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I have a recording, because I've learned to record pretty much everything.

2697
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You know, it's smart, because no way people can fuck with you.

2698
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And another question, why?

2699
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Like, I am.

2700
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm joking.

2701
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm just going to steal it from your cloud later.

2702
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But what was I saying?

2703
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I recorded her saying, well, obviously, you know, the house is great.

2704
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Obviously, Marlo loves you and you love Marlo.

2705
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's not, you know, you guys are great.

2706
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Just, we want you to take a drug test, and that's it.

2707
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And I'm like, okay, that's it.

2708
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I agreed.

2709
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And then I said, and then there's another phone call later,

2710
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
because the next day, four police officers came.

2711
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And that's where I was just, I had enough.

2712
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'm like, look, more fucking police officers.

2713
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Ed, this is the fourth day in a row, and you're still doing this.

2714
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
At what point is this harassment?

2715
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
This is like a few weeks ago.

2716
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah.

2717
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, this is much, what's today the 12th?

2718
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So today, yeah, we're in August now.

2719
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
We're in August.

2720
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2721
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I was looking at the footage last night again.

2722
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It was July 29th.

2723
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
This must be the 30th now.

2724
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
30th or August 1st, right around there.

2725
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Yeah, I think so.

2726
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Because the police came the next day, so it must be the 30th.

2727
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
How many days are in July?

2728
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
July 31.

2729
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So it's 30th or 31st.

2730
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

2731
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I didn't even know.

2732
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I didn't even know.

2733
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I had zero ideas when I asked.

2734
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So, yeah.

2735
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So all of this stuff that's happening,

2736
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
is that what was court on, what was it, on Monday?

2737
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
No, no, no.

2738
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
It gets worse.

2739
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It gets worse when you get to what happens on Sunday.

2740
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So I'm like, I say, Savva, look,

2741
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
and I read her this email.

2742
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I said, look, nothing personal against you.

2743
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You seem like a good person.

2744
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I just, I'm tired of everyone of you guys believing this woman

2745
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and accepting this as fact and not even investigating the caller.

2746
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Clearly, this woman is out of her mind.

2747
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And how can you not delineate saying from insane,

2748
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I think that's your job, but I didn't say it like that.

2749
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I said it very kindly.

2750
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I have a copy of it.

2751
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I supported you.

2752
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And I said, look, I'm just going to say we'll do the drug test,

2753
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
but that's it.

2754
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
We're going to put our foot down.

2755
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
We're not going to do anything else after the drug test.

2756
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
All right.

2757
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
We're just going to, we're not going to, we're going to stop.

2758
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So you tell us what the next move is and we will oblige.

2759
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And that I can quote.

2760
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I mean, I said that tell us what the next move is

2761
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and we will oblige.

2762
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
That's a quote, right?

2763
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And then I didn't hear from her.

2764
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And then Tuesday of that week, we interviewed a clean lady.

2765
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
She came to us from, see, I still think Patel sent her this woman

2766
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
because I asked Patel, do you know anyone that it will clean and babysit?

2767
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Because I feel bad that you, I don't want you to think

2768
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
we're sending Marla over to your place to babysit.

2769
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Okay.

2770
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So I was trying to overcompensate by saying,

2771
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
please give me the name and number of a fucking babysitter.

2772
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
You know, so that way she wouldn't think that.

2773
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
You know, so I still suspect it came from her,

2774
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
but Marie thinks it came from somebody else.

2775
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
So I don't know.

2776
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
But she called us and said, I heard you're looking for a babysitter.

2777
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And I said, yes, we are, but also a cleaning lady too.

2778
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Like you need to be able to clean.

2779
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So she says, I can do that.

2780
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And so we meet her on Tuesday.

2781
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I honestly have no memory of this meeting.

2782
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
But Marie says we met on Tuesday.

2783
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I don't know.

2784
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I don't remember it.

2785
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I mean, briefly, I remember saying, okay, thank you, shaking a hand.

2786
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But I don't know, maybe because I didn't sleep much the night before.

2787
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Cause I mean, it's really weird when you don't sleep, you know,

2788
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and then, you know, cause I'll take a nap at like 130 when the market closes.

2789
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And then my mind will refresh itself.

2790
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But sometimes I don't get that nap.

2791
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So, but Marie showed me and she said, look, right here,

2792
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
you can see the text between Lori and us.

2793
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
She was here on Tuesday.

2794
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
So she went back home and she came back on Friday.

2795
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And that was her first day.

2796
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
She worked Friday and she was good.

2797
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And we paid her 80 bucks in the center on Saturday.

2798
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
She comes back, but she comes late.

2799
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Okay.

2800
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
She is like very late.

2801
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And she says, I went to the dentist and had an abscess.

2802
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And she showed pictures to prove it that she was at the dentist.

2803
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I said, okay, fine.

2804
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So she does all the cleanser of the kitchen,

2805
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
does all the dishes and does the sheets, half the sheets of laundry.

2806
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It takes Marla with her.

2807
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
One interesting thing happened.

2808
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Marla was freaked out in the laundry room.

2809
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And he said to his mom and friends that she,

2810
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Lori turned white and really white.

2811
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And he thought she was going to die.

2812
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
This is Marla.

2813
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So he was very scared for her.

2814
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And we sat her down.

2815
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
We asked her, are you okay?

2816
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
She said, I'm fine.

2817
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I'm fine.

2818
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It's a COPD she has.

2819
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's called, it's some sort of pulmonary thing.

2820
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I don't really know.

2821
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Apparently.

2822
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Yes.

2823
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Apparently she has machines at home.

2824
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
She has a machine, like a little machine that helps her breathe.

2825
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Which I'm like, okay.

2826
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And she had a bunch of these things.

2827
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
The inhaler.

2828
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And it's strange.

2829
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Everyone has an inhaler.

2830
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
She knows, but there's a different looking one.

2831
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It's very odd.

2832
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And it has the date and a wheel.

2833
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So I don't know that much about that one.

2834
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
She doesn't want to go home.

2835
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Okay.

2836
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
She's like 60 years old, mid 60s actually.

2837
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Found out how old she was.

2838
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
She was born in 1960.

2839
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So she's exactly 60 years.

2840
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And then the reason I did that math really quick is because I already knew the answer.

2841
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Okay.

2842
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I knew the answer.

2843
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So she starts crying.

2844
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
At first it was a laugh.

2845
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I heard them both laughing upstairs and I said, what's so funny?

2846
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
What's the joke?

2847
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I want to know the joke.

2848
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And I go, oh, you won't get it.

2849
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You're a man.

2850
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'm like, oh, okay, fine.

2851
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And then I go to the bathroom and then I come out and the crying turned to sobbing.

2852
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Severe fucking sobbing.

2853
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
She was hugging Marie and Marie looked at me like, you know, she also gave me like the

2854
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
go away.

2855
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It's a girl thing.

2856
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
You're not going to let me handle it.

2857
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It's okay.

2858
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
So I go downstairs and Marie says, look, let's let her stay.

2859
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
She doesn't want to go home.

2860
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So we'll put her up in the, we have in the little room at the top of the, if you see the layout,

2861
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
come over.

2862
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
You guys will see the layout for yourselves.

2863
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So she stays in the little room upstairs.

2864
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I don't think much too much about it.

2865
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's not a big deal.

2866
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
She wakes up, she takes a bath, which is odd.

2867
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You know, you don't do that.

2868
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's a weird behavior.

2869
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
She takes a bath and she starts cleaning again.

2870
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And we're like, okay, fine.

2871
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Clean again.

2872
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Sunday was the last, a third day anyway.

2873
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
We did a three day trial and it was the final day.

2874
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So we knew she was gone for good no matter what on Sunday.

2875
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
She's always going out to her car.

2876
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Okay.

2877
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Which I did not think was too suspicious.

2878
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I just thought she was going to join or something because she came back a little, you know,

2879
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
different, but happy, always happy, not miserable.

2880
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And she would talk about her life a little bit.

2881
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
She told us about her daughter in Italy and she married a very wealthy Italian guy.

2882
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And then it gets to be around 9.30, 10.

2883
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And I'm like, Marie, you handled the hours.

2884
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I don't, we're not going to pay her for the time she slept.

2885
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Right.

2886
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
We're not paying her.

2887
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So you take care of this.

2888
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I don't want to deal with it.

2889
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I'm going to the number and I'll send her the money.

2890
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Marie goes, says, okay.

2891
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Next thing I'm in my office area.

2892
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Marie is not hit with her.

2893
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
She comes in and says, I'm really tired.

2894
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Do you mind if I lay down for a few minutes before I drive home?

2895
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And I say, sure, fine, no problem.

2896
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
So she's wearing like a jacket getting ready to, she's ready to leave.

2897
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And then I look at her and like, she's actually ready to leave.

2898
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It's good.

2899
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Take a nap.

2900
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Go for it.

2901
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
She lies down.

2902
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
She doesn't wake up.

2903
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
She dies.

2904
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
She fucking died on her bed.

2905
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
She's fucking dead.

2906
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Like fucking dead.

2907
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Right.

2908
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
And the only reason I knew she was dead was later because I mean, I thought she was alive

2909
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
because at any moment I thought she was going to pop up and we're pushing her and stuff like that.

2910
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And I tried to feel for a pulse and I sort of remember what to do.

2911
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And I swear to God, I felt the pulse and there was warmth in her wrist.

2912
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And it was, unless I was feeling my own pulse in my fingers, which people do that too.

2913
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I don't know.

2914
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
But it wasn't until she, like, I don't know anything about it.

2915
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I mean, I saw my father dead, but I never saw that this happened.

2916
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Like her face turned, it was like a bruise color.

2917
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It was a purplish.

2918
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It was not natural.

2919
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And that's when we knew, like, holy shit, this woman is dead.

2920
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And now it's fucking scary.

2921
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So we were freaked out.

2922
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Marla did not see anything.

2923
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
He was asleep.

2924
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
He was asleep.

2925
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
He's got his little treehouse room on the other side of the wall.

2926
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh, thank you.

2927
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Of course.

2928
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Jesus.

2929
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I mean, we didn't want him walking in either.

2930
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
So at all times, I had someone had to be in front of that door just in case he came down.

2931
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Like, yeah, he doesn't want some more Cheerios, you know, kind of like TV.

2932
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
But of course, this morning, Marla, you can watch all the TV you want.

2933
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
You go upstairs and you watch TV.

2934
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
This is TV morning, right?

2935
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
You watch as much as you want.

2936
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And Marie called the ambulance.

2937
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And then all hell broke loose, man.

2938
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Is it?

2939
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
The ambulance came.

2940
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And what we learned later from the report, because it's in the report,

2941
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
was that, supposedly, Sabah, Sabah, hate with a B, having to,

2942
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,000
was talking to Patel at 9.30 a.m. in the morning on a Monday, which is weird.

2943
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Because Patel did not, she either did not sleep in that before or this is all a lie.

2944
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Okay.

2945
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And calls and says, holy shit, there's an ambulance going to Val's and Marie's.

2946
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Come over now.

2947
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
And then she calls Steve.

2948
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And Steve comes over.

2949
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
So LAPD is there.

2950
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
The ambulance people are there.

2951
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Steve is there.

2952
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Patel is there.

2953
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And not only is she there, but she is screaming at him.

2954
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
He's calling us murderers, saying profanities.

2955
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Throwing fucking rocks.

2956
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Throwing fucking rocks.

2957
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
All right.

2958
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That's how fucking crazy she is.

2959
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Not only did she show up, but all the people that hate us in the building are there.

2960
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Just like really enjoying this.

2961
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Not in the building, but the campus.

2962
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And there's a, there's three or four of them.

2963
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
You know, and one of them is the management.

2964
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
We're in a huge fight with the management.

2965
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
A woman named Ashley Madison.

2966
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Ashley Madison.

2967
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Ashley Madison.

2968
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Ashley Madison.

2969
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Ashley Madison.

2970
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Oh, no, no, no.

2971
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I didn't hack that.

2972
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Actually, something, she's just a pain in the ass.

2973
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And she decided, oh, can I just tell you, police officers that Val, we always thought Val was on drugs.

2974
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
We always thought Marie was on drugs.

2975
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And Bob, Bob, Bob.

2976
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Okay.

2977
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And she, and then this guy named Stosh.

2978
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And I'll tell you, he's like one of these people that always wished he was a Marine, you know, the types.

2979
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
They're like, they wear like the clothes, like they pretend that they were served in Vietnam.

2980
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And they pretend they served in Afghanistan, but they never did anything.

2981
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And they never even left their town.

2982
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And he works at the building too.

2983
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
He opens the door for the cars, basically.

2984
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
He's like a dormant for cars.

2985
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But the attitude, and he's very, he's got this racist fucking thing too.

2986
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And he was there too.

2987
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And he said, excuse me, officer, I would like to talk to you in person a little longer afterwards.

2988
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Yeah, I know exactly.

2989
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
He's just going to talk shit about me.

2990
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And I just was like, what the fuck is happening?

2991
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
The film crew that's following me around, they came.

2992
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And they said, there was so much animosity in the air.

2993
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
They said, we knew, and we don't want to tell you this, but we feel like this was the whole setup.

2994
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
This was planned.

2995
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Like there was people, there was evil there.

2996
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
There was something hatred there for you.

2997
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

2998
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
My name's Rocco.

2999
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It wasn't obviously not now.

3000
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And I've been told about this, Adore.

3001
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But Rocco Castoro, he was the former editor-in-chief of Vice.

3002
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And he's doing a documentary.

3003
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
No.

3004
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Sorry?

3005
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah, I think I saw it on YouTube.

3006
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Oh, you didn't?

3007
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
It's on?

3008
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Formerly.

3009
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Yeah.

3010
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Sorry, you have a new channel.

3011
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yeah, anything with some other, some dude named Tim Pool, which I don't know him,

3012
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
but I heard bad things.

3013
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So I'm trying to distance myself from that name, is what I've been told.

3014
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's like, well, whatever you do, don't associate yourself with that name.

3015
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
But he's financing this project for some reason.

3016
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Yeah, trying to recreate Vice magic.

3017
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Exactly.

3018
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
He was fired, actually.

3019
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah.

3020
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
It was the way he tells the sexual harassment thing that they were covering up in HR.

3021
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And it was a whole mess, because the sexual harassment was from wines,

3022
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
the head of HR worked for Harvey Weinstein as well.

3023
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This is a whole fucking mess.

3024
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
It's like a real fucking crazy shit.

3025
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Anyway, don't believe everything Rocco says, because he exaggerates and bellishes a lot.

3026
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
But he did say, like, we were not welcome.

3027
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
They told us to leave right away.

3028
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And not dating the police, the building.

3029
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So they had to take all this stuff and go.

3030
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And then Marie also said, I felt like we were set up.

3031
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I felt like, how did the fuck did Sabah already have a court date ready on the back of her car when she came?

3032
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
How is that possible?

3033
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
How did she have that court date for Monday?

3034
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And I was like, I don't know.

3035
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I don't know how DCFS works.

3036
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Apparently, the due process is not a thing there.

3037
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
There's no such thing as due process.

3038
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

3039
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And that is fucking terrifying.

3040
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And if you read that report and you were me, you would see.

3041
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
If you could see from my point of view, which I don't know if you'll be able to because you're not me.

3042
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
You don't know what I'm like and what Marie's like and Marla's like and Patel and Steve.

3043
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It's fucking terrifying that this is in the public record.

3044
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And there's a judge that yesterday, the judge heard this.

3045
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And I'm sorry.

3046
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I'm scared to have Hava, the social worker.

3047
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
She comes.

3048
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Marie is fucking in tears.

3049
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
She is crying.

3050
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
She's inconsolable.

3051
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
She is barely in our reality at this point.

3052
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And this woman comes up to her and says,

3053
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
so did you kill her?

3054
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So was it an overdose?

3055
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Are you drugs?

3056
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Yeah?

3057
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Tell me how many drugs did you do today?

3058
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And she's like this.

3059
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Right there.

3060
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And Marie is just uncontrollably sobbing, telling her to fuck off as nice as she possibly can.

3061
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
But she's answering the question.

3062
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
She's like, no, of course not.

3063
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Where's the cleaning supply?

3064
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Show me the cleaning.

3065
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And the LAPD would not let her in the house.

3066
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So that was good.

3067
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
They wanted this woman out there.

3068
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Now, I have some footage of her screaming at Marie because the security camera did get a pretty good view of it.

3069
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I have not gone through any yet because I've been going through all this other shit.

3070
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I will do that later today.

3071
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And I'll find out exactly what the fuck happened.

3072
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Now, everything was fine.

3073
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And the coroner, we had to wait for the coroner.

3074
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And the coroner comes in and he's like, he comes in like a superstar.

3075
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
He's like, everyone's waiting for the coroner.

3076
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
He shows up.

3077
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
He's like, well dressed, well groomed.

3078
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
He's like, hey guys, I'm here.

3079
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And I was like, OK, good.

3080
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Interesting.

3081
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
He was like a personality, which was strange and interesting.

3082
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And then the whole mood changed.

3083
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And all suspicions toward me just sort of dissipated.

3084
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And the guy did his job and he was very thorough.

3085
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And he said, Val, here's the case number.

3086
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Any questions you call me?

3087
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I'm sorry to tell you, but when people die, there's a blood barrier thing in your nose.

3088
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And the blood drips out the nose.

3089
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So there's blood on the bed.

3090
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I was like, no, OK, it's disgusting.

3091
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
He said, you're probably going to want to get rid of the sheets.

3092
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I was like, yes.

3093
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
They will take them for us.

3094
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
They can take the fucking sheets, man.

3095
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
But Saba, during this time, takes Marlowe and gives him the Steve

3096
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
and decides that Marlowe cannot be with us.

3097
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
She makes this decision.

3098
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
She's screaming at Marie.

3099
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Marie is inconsolable and she takes Marlowe.

3100
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
She does not tell Marie, OK, until later.

3101
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And then Marlowe, and if Marie comes to me, I'm inside talking to police officers.

3102
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
She took them.

3103
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
They took Marlowe.

3104
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
They took Marlowe.

3105
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So I start running out there.

3106
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I get to the fucking park and I see Marlowe and he's sitting down.

3107
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I see Saba and they're going about to approach Marlowe.

3108
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I see Steve behind her.

3109
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Just fucking.

3110
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Steve's so sick, he's smiling.

3111
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
He's fucking grinning.

3112
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
He's fucking smiling.

3113
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
He's so happy about this shit.

3114
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And I go there.

3115
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I say, you're not taking Marlowe.

3116
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
No.

3117
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
You're not taking Marlowe.

3118
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I get between her and Marlowe and I say, no.

3119
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Marlowe just comes with me.

3120
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
He grabs my hand.

3121
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
OK.

3122
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And Steve is not like this.

3123
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Saba is fucking upset.

3124
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And she goes, it's like this.

3125
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It makes me work hard.

3126
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It's sort of the sigh.

3127
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
And then she walks over to the police officer and tells him something.

3128
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
He comes over.

3129
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
It's like, you have to release the child now.

3130
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You have to let him go now.

3131
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I don't even know who this woman is.

3132
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
She comes here.

3133
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I don't even see a badge.

3134
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I have no paperwork.

3135
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I have his card with court date on it.

3136
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
OK.

3137
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Nothing.

3138
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Do you see a badge around her?

3139
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
She's just a social worker.

3140
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
She's not a fucking officer.

3141
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And the guy says, listen, you have to let go of the child now.

3142
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So I'm like, OK.

3143
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
So Marlowe is going to be fine.

3144
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
We'll figure it out.

3145
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Don't worry.

3146
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Et cetera.

3147
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Steve takes him off.

3148
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Takes him away.

3149
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And we haven't seen him since.

3150
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Now, we get this fucking shitty lawyer.

3151
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Here's a problem.

3152
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Sorry.

3153
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It's so convoluted.

3154
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But I just want to make sure you got it.

3155
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I want to be thorough.

3156
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Right?

3157
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I don't want to miss any details.

3158
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
This is important.

3159
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Marie is so upset that she doesn't care a woman just died on the bed.

3160
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
She gets a blanket and just goes on the bed and sleeps.

3161
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And I'm like, wow.

3162
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I didn't think she had that in her.

3163
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I was like, there's some coldness in her.

3164
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I'm like, Marie, use that coldness.

3165
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Later I am.

3166
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You've got to use that now.

3167
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
You cannot lose your shit like you did today with Salva.

3168
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Because she was screaming and crying.

3169
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And Marie's not a weak woman.

3170
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
But something happened at that moment.

3171
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
The woman really worked her.

3172
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
And then we immediately called this woman named Dorothy Gibbons White.

3173
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And she is a lawyer that represented a famous friend of Marie's that was an NCIS actress named Zoe.

3174
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And she did the most horrendous thing that he could do.

3175
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
But you know what?

3176
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
She fucking fights dirty.

3177
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
She accused the husband of Zoe of being a child rapist.

3178
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Like raping the son, Sebastian, every day for like a year or something.

3179
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And I'm like, wow.

3180
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Let's fuck that.

3181
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And Marie's like, fuck that.

3182
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I don't think it's true.

3183
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I'm like, what?

3184
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And I'm like, I don't think it's true.

3185
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Like really?

3186
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
It's like, we've got to get this woman.

3187
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You need to fucking hire her.

3188
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Because now we're so pissed off.

3189
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
We need someone to fight dirty.

3190
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So we call her.

3191
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And she says, you know, Sebastian got off.

3192
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But he was held for four months in Kentucky.

3193
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
The police caught him trying to go across state lines.

3194
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
The FBI was involved.

3195
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It's a thing.

3196
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
He really is this dirty.

3197
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And we start to believe her more.

3198
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And we want to believe her.

3199
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Right?

3200
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Because we want her help.

3201
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Because we know that she fights dirty.

3202
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
We want some of the fucking women.

3203
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And I'm here at any cost.

3204
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Whatever the fucking cost is.

3205
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
We want Marlo.

3206
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
You know?

3207
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
And she starts saying, does Steve ever hang out with JP?

3208
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
JP is the name of the guy that's this child rapist.

3209
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
And so he was the wife.

3210
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
So if you look at the internet, if you Google those two names,

3211
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
you'll see the story.

3212
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And as a matter of fact, Steve is friends with this guy, JP.

3213
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And all gravitates around this fucking school called Lila.

3214
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
And the guy that's the head of that school is named Nordeem.

3215
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I filed a police report on him in May for being way too handsy

3216
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
with Marie and all the women at that fucking school

3217
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and the children.

3218
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Because he is grabbing them, hugging them, everybody.

3219
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
He's very handsy.

3220
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
And it's a French thing to do.

3221
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I get it.

3222
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
But we're not fucking friends.

3223
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
All right?

3224
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And Marlo doesn't like it.

3225
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
He does not like it when the guy grabs his fucking shoulder

3226
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
all the time and rubs his back.

3227
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
He doesn't like it.

3228
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And I tell Marlo, well, tell him not to do it.

3229
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You know?

3230
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
If I'd see him, I'll fucking tell him.

3231
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
But I've never seen him do it.

3232
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Marlo tells us.

3233
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
So I was pissed off.

3234
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And on top of that, this guy says to Marie right to email,

3235
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Marie wants to have a meeting with the teacher

3236
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
because we're worried about Marlo's work

3237
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
because he wasn't doing his math and work.

3238
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
He's lying to us about it.

3239
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And she wanted to set up a meeting.

3240
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And Nordeem said, he's the head guy.

3241
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
The guy that's too handsy says, Marie.

3242
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
He's the principal.

3243
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
He's the principal.

3244
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Yeah.

3245
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
He says, Marie, I would go, but you have to go.

3246
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I'll tell you when the meeting will be.

3247
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And Steve is going to be there.

3248
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And Marie says, I'm not.

3249
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I can't be in a room with Steve.

3250
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I do not want to be meeting with Steve.

3251
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I'll do my own meeting.

3252
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Steve can do it.

3253
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I have his own meeting.

3254
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And then he says, and I shit you not, Marie,

3255
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
if you don't go to the meeting with your husband,

3256
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I will call Child Services on you.

3257
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
In an email.

3258
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And we have that email.

3259
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
OK.

3260
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
And then that's when I lose my shit.

3261
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And I fucking call the police.

3262
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I said, this guy's harassing us.

3263
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
He's being fucking handsy.

3264
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
He just threatened my girlfriend.

3265
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And what he does with the kids is fucking strange.

3266
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Now, take that completely unrelated.

3267
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I had no idea that Dorothy Gibbons White, the prosecutor,

3268
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
also had a file on this guy.

3269
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Apparently, there is something fucking weird shit going on down there.

3270
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
How much of it is real?

3271
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I don't know.

3272
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
How much of it is fake?

3273
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I don't know.

3274
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Because she is, again, fights dirty.

3275
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
But she blends fiction with fact, but she does it well.

3276
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And I can't even fucking tell the truth anymore.

3277
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So I don't care at this point.

3278
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Maria doesn't care.

3279
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
We're going to have to go to that level and accuse Steve

3280
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
of hanging out with a known fucking kiddie fiddler.

3281
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
How to file.

3282
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
If that's what's going to win, then let's just fucking do it.

3283
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So she says, all right.

3284
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
But here she says, and I have, and I'm

3285
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
happy if you guys want to take this further and go for it.

3286
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Because I have, I recorded all of it.

3287
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
So you have her on tape saying to Marie,

3288
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
do you think Marlo, could you get Marlo to say this?

3289
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Could you get him to say this?

3290
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
She's like, probably.

3291
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Yeah.

3292
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
This is what we need Marlo to say.

3293
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And Marlo's eight.

3294
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
She's fucking saying that on the phone.

3295
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
She says, if I were you, it was my family,

3296
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I would want Mike Kratzmer to represent me.

3297
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
It's like a mafia down there.

3298
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But he's in the mafia, but he's like a spy.

3299
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
He's a good guy.

3300
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I'm like, OK.

3301
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So that's the guy we call.

3302
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
He immediately wants $15,000.

3303
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And he is a fucking piece of work.

3304
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And he's the worst lawyer I've ever fucking seen.

3305
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
He's the one that reached out to jamming

3306
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
and said he was representing me.

3307
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
All right.

3308
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
No, there's one thing I missed.

3309
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I thought it was $15,000.

3310
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
No, we did not.

3311
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
No, not at all.

3312
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Fuck yeah.

3313
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
That's $700 an hour for three days of work.

3314
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And what he did on Monday was nothing.

3315
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
He did not say a fucking, he did not defend us.

3316
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
He said, I don't even have to show up on the camera.

3317
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
OK.

3318
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Just Marie's going to sit there.

3319
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
So I set up this whole thing with lights,

3320
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
beautiful.

3321
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And you have to call him.

3322
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Yeah, you have to call him.

3323
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah.

3324
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And a proper camera with a proper lens.

3325
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So she looked good.

3326
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Like everyone else was looking good, right?

3327
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But the lawyer, no, he fucked up.

3328
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Sent us a link at the last second.

3329
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And she had to do it from her phone.

3330
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It looked terrible.

3331
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And we were the only ones, or she was the only one

3332
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
holding the phone.

3333
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Everyone else was at their computers.

3334
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Well-dressed.

3335
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Everything looked good.

3336
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And Marie's, we just looked unprepared.

3337
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
And Clumsy Inn just, it was terrible.

3338
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And the lawyer did not defend us.

3339
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
He did not say that none of this is true.

3340
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
He didn't say that the teal was crazy.

3341
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
He didn't say that Steve was using this as a tool for anything.

3342
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
He just said one thing.

3343
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
He said, all I ask is that the child is not sleeping

3344
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
in the same bed as the father.

3345
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And I say, oh shit, I know who he's going for.

3346
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I know who he's building up, what he's going to build up to.

3347
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
But he doesn't defend us.

3348
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And that's when I start losing, then I start texting him

3349
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
and say, what are you doing?

3350
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
You didn't put anything into evidence.

3351
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
You didn't mention anything about all these disdainless litany

3352
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
things I've sent him.

3353
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And he just screams at me and tells me,

3354
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm not listening to him.

3355
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

3356
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
If I was a brain surgeon, would you tell a brain surgeon

3357
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
what to do?

3358
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You know, et cetera, et cetera.

3359
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And then it was just-

3360
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Did you submit a brief to the court?

3361
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I don't know.

3362
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
We don't even have it.

3363
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
As far as I know, he submitted nothing.

3364
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
He said he didn't give the court anything.

3365
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
He just asked the late, did you read the documents?

3366
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And she says, not yet, give me a few minutes.

3367
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
That's all I remember.

3368
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And then she read the documents.

3369
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And then she said, I want to see this guy dial.

3370
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Because I'm painting out to be this controlling, fucking asshole

3371
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
that is like, you know, Marie is too weak to speak for herself.

3372
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And Marie is so fucking sick of hearing from men telling her

3373
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
how weak she is that she needs another man to speak for her.

3374
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Like, if you guys don't ever tell that to her,

3375
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
because she's slacking.

3376
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
All right.

3377
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But that's how she's painted out, not only by Steve,

3378
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
but by everybody.

3379
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
All right.

3380
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And now I am the controlling Spangali that is controlling her.

3381
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
For what purpose?

3382
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I don't know.

3383
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
You know, it's not like she has money.

3384
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
There's nothing I want.

3385
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I'm trying to get for her.

3386
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
But apparently this is what I'm painting out.

3387
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
There's one more important thing after that.

3388
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It's where I forget.

3389
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
It's really important.

3390
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Lori, the woman, she took out the garbage once.

3391
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I wish there was one more than one.

3392
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
But there was this one time, I think it was Saturday.

3393
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
There were three of that.

3394
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Lori's the one who passed the law.

3395
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Yes.

3396
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Yes.

3397
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
But three different bags of black garbage.

3398
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
And I wasn't, this is told to me by Marie.

3399
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
It's the second hand.

3400
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Marie will tell you the full story, much better than me.

3401
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And Marie felt something was wrong.

3402
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Something suspicious, because she was watching the bags

3403
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
from upstairs, which she thought was great.

3404
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
So Marie said, I'll just take these bags out.

3405
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
And Marie and Lori was trying to tell her,

3406
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
no, don't do what I'll do.

3407
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
And she's like, no, that's okay.

3408
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I'll take them out.

3409
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And I think Marlowe goes with her.

3410
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I don't remember.

3411
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
She goes outside.

3412
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
She opens the garbage.

3413
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
And in Garbage Bag A are my files from when

3414
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I was in Cook County, foster care.

3415
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
It's a stack of this big that I got when David was

3416
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
doing my background.

3417
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And so we got all this stuff from Cook County in Chicago.

3418
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
And it's a huge stack of papers of my own,

3419
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
tired childhood, in the misery of it all.

3420
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Included in that is a notebook that I wrote in,

3421
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,000
like poems and songs from when I was like 16 or 17.

3422
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And there was another screenplay that was really

3423
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
terrible, shitty screenplay, but I don't know

3424
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
why she chose that.

3425
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
But you had to go to get this file.

3426
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
You had to know where they were.

3427
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
They were in my library.

3428
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And you have to go and scrap them.

3429
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It was not something that was accessible.

3430
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Now bag number two was the same thing,

3431
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
but for Marlowe.

3432
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
It was Marlowe's school assessments,

3433
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
all the teacher assessments, all his grades,

3434
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
everything he's ever gotten from school.

3435
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It's all in this one dossier sort of thing.

3436
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
In the third bag, there wasn't anything interesting.

3437
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
She said there was, there might have been something,

3438
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
but not like this, something else.

3439
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And so Marie flipped out, you know,

3440
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
what this means.

3441
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I still don't know what this means.

3442
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's very strange.

3443
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So she was taking out the trash,

3444
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
but it hadn't gone all the way yet?

3445
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
No.

3446
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Well, she was going to steal it.

3447
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
So she was pretending, this is how she was going

3448
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
to get the papers out in the garbage cans,

3449
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
in the garbage bags, and then pretend that she was...

3450
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Yes, yes, this stage.

3451
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And that's why maybe she was going to her car all the time.

3452
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And we found out that she did steal some shit from us,

3453
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
which is funny enough, the Crystal Jewelry.

3454
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I shit she not, I shit she not.

3455
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
She stole the fucking Crystal Jewelry that Marlowe made.

3456
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Yes.

3457
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Okay.

3458
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So that's the short version.

3459
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Yeah?

3460
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Cleaning up.

3461
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Cleaning up.

3462
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Yeah, and then I got...

3463
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Actually, yesterday, I got a text from Rocco,

3464
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
who's the guy...

3465
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
The film...

3466
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
The film...

3467
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Yeah, the ex-Vice News guy.

3468
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
He said...

3469
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
He did some background on Lori,

3470
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and he said that she was...

3471
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Rocco.

3472
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Okay.

3473
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
It's Lori Roth, date of birth, 117, 1960.

3474
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
She has an extensive criminal history,

3475
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
breaking and entering, distribution and trespassing.

3476
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
If your neighbor was watching Marlowe

3477
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
and claiming he had bruises around the times,

3478
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
we were shooting, I can refute that with footage.

3479
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Okay, let's...

3480
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Yeah, she claimed that he had bruises and a black eye.

3481
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
That Marlowe had a fucking black eye.

3482
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Never.

3483
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Never.

3484
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Never.

3485
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Never.

3486
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
He never had bruises other than falling off his bicycle.

3487
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
You know, his scraped knee.

3488
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
What did the judge finally decide on Monday?

3489
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
The judge said...

3490
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
The judge said, okay, great.

3491
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
So, I want to see this Val person.

3492
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Can we please see Val?

3493
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And so, he recalls me and I sit down.

3494
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I don't say a word,

3495
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
because our lawyer says, don't talk.

3496
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So, I listen to the lawyer.

3497
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And she looks at me.

3498
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
There's a pause for like three or four seconds,

3499
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
and she says, I'm going to recommend

3500
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
that the child does not see Val Brooksman at all

3501
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
and has minimum visits with the mother.

3502
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Minimum visits.

3503
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Minimum.

3504
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Like, the bare minimum that they have to...

3505
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
The minimum.

3506
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
They could give away a few hours, three days a week.

3507
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
You know?

3508
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Is there a deadline that someone not acquires

3509
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
or wouldn't go back to court?

3510
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Nope.

3511
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
We had no paperwork.

3512
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
We did nothing.

3513
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I had no paperwork from anyone.

3514
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
No one from fucking DCF asked.

3515
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
From the courts.

3516
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Nothing.

3517
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Can you tell me on September 29th,

3518
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
you guys have the follow-up hearing

3519
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
where they'll make a more firm decision?

3520
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Or is that...

3521
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yeah.

3522
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
So, on September 15th,

3523
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I thought that was the court,

3524
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
that if it's not,

3525
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
it's when the investigator has to hand in his paperwork.

3526
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And then the next trial date is the 29th.

3527
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And if there's no amicable decision made,

3528
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
October 1st is the real trial,

3529
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
like a trial trial,

3530
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
where people will get witnesses,

3531
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
like the television or something.

3532
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Okay.

3533
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
So, yeah.

3534
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
So that's...

3535
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
All right.

3536
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
The short version.

3537
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
It's pretty crazy.

3538
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
It's like the cop said,

3539
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
he's like,

3540
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
you got hit with a double wham.

3541
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
A double wham.

3542
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And that's been stuck in my head ever since.

3543
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
He was very right.

3544
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
He was a double fucking triple wham.

3545
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Sorry.

3546
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I'm sorry.

3547
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Speak my language.

3548
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
How often does that film feature,

3549
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
you know, sector guys?

3550
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Not often.

3551
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Not anymore.

3552
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
So they've filmed...

3553
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So David Enrich,

3554
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
you know,

3555
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
he tried to get a film deal

3556
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
during this whole thing,

3557
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
very unethical,

3558
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
and he held on to...

3559
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
You probably don't want to hear any of this shit,

3560
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
but I'll tell you anyway,

3561
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
because it's so fucking political.

3562
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
If you're like Tim and Jim,

3563
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
you don't want to hear it.

3564
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
But Trump has these loans

3565
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
with Deutsche Bank, right?

3566
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And David sat on them

3567
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
for a very long time.

3568
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
And I'm like,

3569
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
why did you sit on them?

3570
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
He said,

3571
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
well, Deutsche Bank told me they were fake.

3572
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I'm like, no.

3573
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
You listen to Deutsche Bank told me.

3574
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
He has a deal set up with Deutsche Bank.

3575
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It's kind of Eurgen.

3576
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I forgot his last name,

3577
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
but he's the head of the PR.

3578
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's a, you know,

3579
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
scratch on my back,

3580
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I'll scratch yours.

3581
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And for example,

3582
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
with Tom Bowers,

3583
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
remember Tom Bowers?

3584
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Tom Bowers was

3585
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Rosemary Vibraleck's boss

3586
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
at DBTCA.

3587
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Rosemary Vibraleck

3588
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
was Trump's private banker

3589
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
at Deutsche Bank.

3590
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So he died.

3591
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
His death was very suspicious.

3592
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It was suicide.

3593
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
He hung himself in Malibu.

3594
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
It was similar to my father.

3595
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Very similar.

3596
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
And then the coroner,

3597
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
there was a huge problem with the body.

3598
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
We couldn't get the police report

3599
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
because the body had melted

3600
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
mysteriously on Christmas Day

3601
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
and they shipped it to Virginia

3602
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
for some reason.

3603
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And that's, so we can't,

3604
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
it's cause of death,

3605
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
no one can tell anyone.

3606
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Very fucking weird, right?

3607
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Of all the bodies in the world,

3608
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
of all the deaths in the world,

3609
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
this is death.

3610
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
That is, no evidence.

3611
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It's just fucking strange.

3612
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And that was the last time

3613
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I spoke to Jim and Tammy as well.

3614
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I bring up Tom Bowers

3615
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
because, why do I bring up Tom Bowers?

3616
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Oh, because he knows about the lungs, right?

3617
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
That was David's source.

3618
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And I know that can be a whole mean source.

3619
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And then when he died,

3620
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
David tweeted out,

3621
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
it was a sad day,

3622
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Tom Bowers died today.

3623
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
He said, he's a good man.

3624
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
He's got a family, sir.

3625
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
He left out the most important bit,

3626
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
suicide, right?

3627
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Because he has to deal with

3628
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Deutsche Grange.

3629
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
They said, do not imagine the suicide.

3630
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So it was myself and Scott Steadman.

3631
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I told Scott about it.

3632
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And Scott is a,

3633
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
he's like a Twitter,

3634
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
forensic music,

3635
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
he runs this thing called forensic music.

3636
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It's like a Twitter phenomenon.

3637
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It's like 20 years old,

3638
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
he's got a million followers.

3639
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Because he handles

3640
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
the Trump-Russia thing really well.

3641
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
So I tell him this story

3642
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
and he gets on.

3643
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
He's a genius with public information.

3644
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
He finds anything in the public domain

3645
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
and he gets the cause of death.

3646
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And then we do a story about the cause of death.

3647
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And now we're in a battle against David.

3648
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
As I've always,

3649
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
as I've been since that fucking article came up.

3650
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Sorry, that's,

3651
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I don't know why

3652
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
it felt that was important

3653
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
for you guys to know.

3654
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
So you said David was,

3655
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
you began by saying David was sitting on the,

3656
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
sitting on the wall.

3657
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Yeah.

3658
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
The Trump bill, you know.

3659
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
But then,

3660
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
forensic news,

3661
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
did they have their own?

3662
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I mean, I guess the,

3663
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
the George Bank of data,

3664
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
seems like you shared it with Tim,

3665
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
with Tim and more?

3666
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I did.

3667
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I gave it to Tim and Jeremy.

3668
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
And then,

3669
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
David also had a copy of it.

3670
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
No, I never,

3671
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I never gave David a full,

3672
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I would never,

3673
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I do not,

3674
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
you know,

3675
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I gave him a doc,

3676
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
a selective amount of documents.

3677
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
But then,

3678
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
he's had the Trump data.

3679
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
No.

3680
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
No, no, no.

3681
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So how did,

3682
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
how did David know about it?

3683
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Tell him about it.

3684
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Okay.

3685
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Now, if you remember,

3686
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
there was a guy,

3687
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
he's a pundit,

3688
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
he's like a liberal-ish,

3689
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
not Chris Matthews,

3690
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
but,

3691
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I can't remember his name.

3692
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
But he went on the air one,

3693
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
one night and said,

3694
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
ladies and gentlemen breaking news,

3695
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I have the Trump loan documents,

3696
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
from the Russian banks.

3697
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And they are very well,

3698
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
very much exactly what you thought,

3699
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
you guys all thought.

3700
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Stay tuned,

3701
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
et cetera, et cetera.

3702
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Next day,

3703
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
he says,

3704
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
ladies and gentlemen,

3705
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I have to retract my statement,

3706
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
from the other night.

3707
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I don't have them.

3708
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Turns out they were fraudulent.

3709
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And so,

3710
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
what the fuck.

3711
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And Deutsche Bank's lawyer

3712
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
has got ahold of this guy.

3713
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
He's a famous name,

3714
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I just can't,

3715
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
it's not coming to my mind.

3716
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
And told him that

3717
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
these are fraudulent documents

3718
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
and if you go,

3719
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
you're gonna fucking see the shit out of you,

3720
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
you're never gonna work again.

3721
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
And that's what you got scared

3722
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
and backed out.

3723
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Now there are some fraudulent documents

3724
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
out there,

3725
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I've seen them on Scribd.

3726
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
They're terrible,

3727
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
frauds,

3728
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
but these aren't the ones.

3729
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
These are different documents.

3730
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Fraudulent documents are more...

3731
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Not in my data set.

3732
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Not just Deutsche Bank.

3733
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Well,

3734
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
my data set's grown substantially

3735
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
since 2014,

3736
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
but it's not from my data set.

3737
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Please.

3738
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
It's like no one's talking about

3739
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
the best way that we can help people.

3740
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
There's a couple options right now

3741
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
that we already have to talk about a little bit

3742
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
as far as the investigator goes, right?

3743
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
What are the allegations against you?

3744
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I mean, I know we've talked about all of them,

3745
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
but you have like some where you've,

3746
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
like if you see the lack of food

3747
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
and you have cell phones everywhere.

3748
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Yeah, I don't really know what the allegations are,

3749
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
other than drug addicts.

3750
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
You know, but it's easy to call them drug addicts.

3751
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I am very open about my past.

3752
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Right.

3753
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
You know, I've taken drugs.

3754
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It's a big deal.

3755
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You're not undergoing now,

3756
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
because you said you know a drug test.

3757
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Yes.

3758
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
So that should be,

3759
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
that should probably solve itself, right?

3760
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It should, but it doesn't.

3761
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It didn't,

3762
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
because then the,

3763
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
our lawyers just don't take any drug tests,

3764
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
don't talk to them if they call,

3765
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
you hang up.

3766
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
If they're at the door,

3767
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
you don't open it.

3768
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
They're like, okay, fine.

3769
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Do you recommend that safe thing?

3770
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I don't know.

3771
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Well,

3772
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
he's the lawyer.

3773
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I just decided,

3774
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
he knows more than me.

3775
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
So I trust him,

3776
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
blindly,

3777
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
until yesterday.

3778
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
My,

3779
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
my,

3780
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
so that's what I did.

3781
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
And that was stupid of me.

3782
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Very fucking stupid of me.

3783
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And Marie did the same thing.

3784
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And if I had not trusted him,

3785
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Marie would not have trusted him.

3786
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Does Marie also get a drug test

3787
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
after her work you said?

3788
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Yes,

3789
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
randomly.

3790
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Yes.

3791
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I would imagine that.

3792
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
It wouldn't be a huge issue,

3793
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
because if Marie already got a drug test,

3794
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
there would be one after the last.

3795
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Right.

3796
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And it's perfectly okay to go with your own doctor,

3797
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
because you don't trust these DCF people

3798
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
and give your own fucking drug test.

3799
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
You're overseen by doctor,

3800
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
and your doctor will hand it to you.

3801
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
That's fine too.

3802
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I read it online.

3803
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
But the Saba woman would not allow that.

3804
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
She didn't want that.

3805
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And I also said,

3806
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
no,

3807
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Saba,

3808
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
and I have it on the table.

3809
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Saba,

3810
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I said I was willing to take a drug test.

3811
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I didn't say I was going to be there

3812
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
at 3.30

3813
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
and Beverly Hills

3814
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
on fucking Friday.

3815
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
That I did not say.

3816
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
It was,

3817
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
well,

3818
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
you know that if you don't take a test,

3819
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
it's going to,

3820
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
that means that you are called,

3821
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
quote, dirty,

3822
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
they call it.

3823
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Well,

3824
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
that's a,

3825
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
well,

3826
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
you know that's a bunch of bullshit.

3827
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
It's a lie.

3828
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Why would you do that?

3829
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
That's just the way it is.

3830
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Can she get what you want

3831
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
in Beverly Hills?

3832
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
She said anytime between nine

3833
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
and five

3834
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
on a Friday,

3835
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
on Friday,

3836
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
yes,

3837
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
in Beverly Hills.

3838
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Okay.

3839
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And then I was,

3840
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
we're both ready to go

3841
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
until Thursday night

3842
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
before police come.

3843
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Okay.

3844
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
And then we're pissed off.

3845
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
And we're like,

3846
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
you know what?

3847
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I'd help that Mike

3848
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
recommend not.

3849
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Yes.

3850
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Yes.

3851
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So it's like,

3852
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
you know,

3853
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
we weren't even supposed to call her

3854
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
and say no,

3855
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
we're just,

3856
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
but we picked up the phone

3857
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
or stupidly even talked to her.

3858
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
But this woman is,

3859
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
it's like,

3860
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
something's wrong.

3861
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Something's really wrong.

3862
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
We don't know what it is.

3863
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I know what I don't know,

3864
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
which is a substantial.

3865
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Are you guys,

3866
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
do you guys know anything even,

3867
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
that I don't know?

3868
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
What can you help me with this?

3869
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
What is happening?

3870
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I don't know.

3871
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I don't know.

3872
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I don't know.

3873
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I have no idea.

3874
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
No one's told me anything.

3875
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Even Mike,

3876
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
the lawyer is supposed to be

3877
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
the greatest ever.

3878
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
He doesn't,

3879
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
he told me shit.

3880
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
He fired him.

3881
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That's right.

3882
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Interesting.

3883
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Do you guys have things

3884
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
for another lawyer?

3885
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Well,

3886
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
that's what I was going to find

3887
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
out today.

3888
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
See what you guys can do.

3889
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And if you could save us,

3890
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
you know,

3891
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
you know,

3892
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I don't know.

3893
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I don't know.

3894
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I don't know.

3895
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I don't know.

3896
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I don't know.

3897
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I don't know.

3898
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I don't know.

3899
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
If you could save us,

3900
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
you know,

3901
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
$15,000,

3902
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
it would be great.

3903
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
But I'm trying,

3904
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I have to gauge what you can do

3905
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
to see if I need a lawyer.

3906
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
That's why I'm

3907
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
making this right now.

3908
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So not only you're gauging me,

3909
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
but I'm gauging this.

3910
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
It's a tough call.

3911
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Like,

3912
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
we're not going to send

3913
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
an FBI lawyer to represent me.

3914
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Right.

3915
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
The things we can do,

3916
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I mean,

3917
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
if there's a question of money,

3918
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
sometimes we can

3919
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
get you some money.

3920
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
But obviously I can't.

3921
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
We have,

3922
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,040
You know, obviously, we're not wealthy, but we can do this.

3923
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,440
Yeah, remember what you were saying,

3924
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,160
and I mean, you've missed your wealth yourself.

3925
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,560
You said trade didn't end one time.

3926
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:12,960
Yeah, I mean, I've lost more than you made, but yeah, I got it.

3927
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,160
You know, don't tell, don't tell Mary.

3928
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,160
You're doing the last few more.

3929
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:24,000
Actually, that's probably my best, when crisis, time, and crisis.

3930
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,920
So there's that type of stuff.

3931
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,360
The other thing that we talked about, too, is we have to keep

3932
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:30,600
our relationship secret.

3933
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,680
Yeah, that's the only way that we can do it.

3934
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:36,320
So if, you know, I call a shop, stop, or something like that,

3935
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,880
and say, hey, we've got the deal, so we'll tell you why you want to know.

3936
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:40,240
Sure.

3937
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,320
You have to stay small on it, right?

3938
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,840
So our relationship with you is going to be limited in scope, right?

3939
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,560
Like we talked about, it's likely going to be something where, you know,

3940
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,320
it's going to be something.

3941
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,840
You know, I look at electronic cigarette thing, I just can't believe it.

3942
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,800
Are you going to know all this smoke, electronic?

3943
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,720
Really? Inside?

3944
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,520
It's just, but it's not real.

3945
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,680
I'm not aware of it.

3946
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:08,240
So the main thing that we would call it, the main thing that we would be able to

3947
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:11,040
help with is, like, everything's going well, right?

3948
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,120
We can't change what's going on in the past, right?

3949
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:17,440
Because we can't change what, you know, Isala said, or what your neighbors have

3950
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,240
said, or anything.

3951
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,440
Sure, right.

3952
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:23,040
But going forward, we can help you with the investigator, right?

3953
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,640
Because the investigator is going to assess you and Marie to see if you

3954
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,920
get the two full parents.

3955
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:30,960
So those are things that we can help with.

3956
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,800
I'm trying to think there are other avenues that would like you.

3957
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,920
I made a whole list of stuff.

3958
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,160
I've been studying law for like a week, okay?

3959
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:40,200
I'm not a lawyer, but I figured there's some things that they've done very

3960
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,720
illegally, all right?

3961
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:45,120
Due process still exists, even in that court, all right?

3962
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,920
Even though some lawyers say no, some lawyers say yes, it does exist.

3963
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:53,080
We read online on reputable law websites.

3964
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:56,200
They're not supposed to invite themselves in and walk in.

3965
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,720
They did.

3966
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:07,240
This woman is clearly, the lies are so ridiculously, too many lies.

3967
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:14,000
And the only reason for that is to paint a picture because you have an agenda.

3968
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,800
Why, why she has this agenda?

3969
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,920
Why she wants to destroy me or Marie?

3970
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:21,840
I don't know, I mean, I get it.

3971
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,240
I've encountered people like this before.

3972
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:26,640
I don't know why they do it, but they want to do it.

3973
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:29,640
It's either, Marie always says I'm going to kill this, you know?

3974
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,160
I don't think it's jealousy.

3975
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,200
I think it's something else.

3976
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:36,520
I don't know what it is, but there's some reason that she wants us destroyed.

3977
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:41,920
And she, and you have to, what I've learned is that this system,

3978
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,520
just the DCFS, is very corrupt.

3979
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,200
There's some, they know each other.

3980
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,640
It's ancestral, they all know each other.

3981
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:55,280
This guy that worked there, our lawyer and customer, he was threatening Marie.

3982
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:59,000
Okay, when we left, he fucking threatened her and said, you know what?

3983
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,560
If you don't get a vow, because I was calling him out, I said, why didn't you do this?

3984
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:07,440
If you don't get a vow to stop acting like a bully and know everything,

3985
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,600
you're going to have to make a choice between your son and Val.

3986
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,560
We have that on tape, too.

3987
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,560
You got to hear this fucking, too.

3988
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,560
It's crazy.

3989
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,320
Okay.

3990
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:22,520
Full soldier, too, I've dealt with this and other cases that are similar to yours.

3991
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,400
With DCFI?

3992
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,600
With DCFI?

3993
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,600
In Texas.

3994
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:27,600
Oh, okay.

3995
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,600
In some organizations.

3996
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:32,440
But we don't, the thing is, I'm not an expert either, right?

3997
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:36,200
We've worked with some things in the past that have been successful stuff,

3998
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,200
and we actually got some good work out of it.

3999
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,560
Everything turned out fine.

4000
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,960
So that's my experience with it.

4001
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,080
I'm not an expert in custody law and now across this work,

4002
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,200
I learn something new every day.

4003
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:53,320
So the primary issue I see is this, like, if we're going to help, right,

4004
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:58,120
we're going to help and be effective in our job, but also be effective for you.

4005
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:05,400
So trying to uncover a conspiracy with Saba makes it, like, I mean,

4006
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:09,120
I don't think there's some weird stuff going on, but that's what I'm saying is that

4007
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:12,080
if the investigator does his job properly or her job properly,

4008
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,600
they should see that you guys are successful parents who can help raise Marlowe

4009
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,000
in a very productive way.

4010
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,280
But here's the thing.

4011
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:24,560
Any competent person, whether you're a DCFS or a police officer,

4012
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,960
anyone that is trained to deal with people,

4013
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,200
can delineate a same person from an insane person, right?

4014
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,840
You should be able to do that.

4015
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:41,400
Now, when you meet Patel and you read her shit, she's obviously fucking nuts, right?

4016
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,160
Sorry for this, but clinical terms, she's fucking nuts.

4017
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,320
She's out there.

4018
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:51,760
And for Saba, I know is able to determine the difference between saying and not saying.

4019
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:57,440
So she purposely, I suspect that she's a smart person,

4020
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,960
that she purposely included this woman's testimony for a reason.

4021
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,680
She's against it, because she must know that she's fucking nuts.

4022
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:05,680
They're using her.

4023
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:08,360
It's sad for this woman.

4024
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:12,640
I'm not that sympathetic for her anymore because she's did it, but it's, you know what I mean?

4025
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,600
I'm not saying it's very simple.

4026
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,920
It's the first time I've heard it.

4027
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,680
So you're saying that she's clinically insane, right?

4028
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,600
She's got a frontier bipolar.

4029
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,320
Maybe not insane, but that's exaggeration.

4030
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,240
Mentally unstable, for sure.

4031
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:27,120
Classic bipolar.

4032
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,240
I'm willing to bet you anything you'll find bipolar medication.

4033
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,840
But just for reference, right?

4034
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,560
We probably wouldn't want to make that claim, right?

4035
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,920
You would, yes.

4036
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,360
Or you would not.

4037
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:44,040
Because if it's one, easy to tell that someone is clinically insane, and two,

4038
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:48,280
you know that she's insane, and three, why would you give custody to her

4039
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,960
for several hours a week?

4040
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,000
Because we didn't know it at the time.

4041
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,840
He just hurt himself, right?

4042
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,800
So like, you know at the time, he's same argument to the lady with the investigation.

4043
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,880
So that's an avenue I think would be dangerous for you than anything else, right?

4044
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,560
So we get her to retract her statement.

4045
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,240
Well, here's the thing.

4046
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:10,120
So again, are we going to go over there and break her off to retract the statement?

4047
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:12,520
Yeah, I'm ready to go to the Armenian.

4048
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,920
I'm like, let's go find the Armenians.

4049
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,040
They handle this shit, right?

4050
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,560
Luckily, we're lucky for you.

4051
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,200
The FBI doesn't do that, right?

4052
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:25,520
I mean, we are on the side of good because we're not going to influence people in that way.

4053
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:26,480
It's just not how we work.

4054
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,080
And like I told you on phone, I'll be honest with you.

4055
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,480
What we can and what we can't do, I'm not going to make a story for you to say like,

4056
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:35,640
oh, we can turn the world around immediately for you right now.

4057
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:36,440
No, I know.

4058
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:36,960
I know.

4059
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:37,800
I don't expect that.

4060
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:41,880
But I'm trying to work with you to see what avenues we can best help with.

4061
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:48,720
So like I said, the best thing I can think of right now is influencing how you're perceived.

4062
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:53,360
And not in a negative way, not in a way that's illegal or anything, but just saying like,

4063
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:59,760
hey, if you have these issues, if you have, they say, oh, there's not enough food in the house.

4064
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,040
And then we just show receipts, you get an Amazon delivery every week or something like that.

4065
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,720
Yeah, we have the receipts.

4066
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:10,920
So all those things would be easily refuted by evidence that you can show.

4067
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:15,520
And there's no evidence that the FBI is helping you or, you know, if we give you money to do that,

4068
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,920
that's just cash that you have, right?

4069
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,920
So all those things are ways that we can help your view in the court size.

4070
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:27,720
Because what we talked about too and what we talked about on the phone is that it's very rare

4071
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:30,680
that they take custody completely away from the parent.

4072
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:35,080
It can happen in very extreme cases, but at least the ones that I've been involved in,

4073
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,960
the judge almost always favors.

4074
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:40,640
And what we talked about, the mom almost wouldn't have a father or whatever.

4075
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,400
I believe that you believe that.

4076
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,920
But what I've read and studied in the last few days about this specific system in Los Angeles

4077
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,640
and these people, it's not that.

4078
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:49,560
It's the opposite.

4079
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,920
They give it to the perpetrator.

4080
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:56,760
They give it to the person that has the most money or the person that's been doing the illegal fake calls.

4081
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:02,560
Because this is, obviously you can imagine, this is a tool used in many, many divorces.

4082
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,400
That's the complicated part of it.

4083
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:10,000
And I have not experienced in this, but just, you know, you've had an experience in the past

4084
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,160
and you've been like, this is complicated.

4085
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:17,320
It's not just a child welfare situation, it's a divorce.

4086
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,320
It's weaponized.

4087
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,160
They weaponized DCFS for divorce.

4088
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,960
It's terrible, but that's what's happening.

4089
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:22,760
And they know it.

4090
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,760
And they're using it and making a lot of money.

4091
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:27,160
They're fucking lawyers and judges.

4092
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:32,160
Like, for example, Sabah makes $120,000 a year.

4093
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:36,280
Her supervisor makes 210 public records.

4094
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,480
That's a lot of money for DCFS, right?

4095
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,480
And they have the other $80,000.

4096
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,520
What's other?

4097
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,760
Where did that $80,000 come from?

4098
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:43,920
Over time.

4099
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,920
$60,000.

4100
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:46,040
Over time.

4101
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,800
And $25,000.

4102
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,960
Other $90,000.

4103
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,360
So what the fuck?

4104
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,800
Is that normal?

4105
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,800
I don't know, okay.

4106
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:01,240
Anyway, I'm just saying it's suspicious to me.

4107
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,600
But yeah, well, what can you do?

4108
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,800
What can you do?

4109
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:07,000
What is in your power and what's not?

4110
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,880
We have to do some more research, because the issue is what we can do would make it

4111
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,440
over it also, right?

4112
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,920
Also, you don't have a rebuttal either.

4113
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:21,320
We wrote it on the piece of paper, the FPVF thing with like these, then we put sticky

4114
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,840
notes on the fake sticky notes on a digital thing.

4115
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,360
Can't find it anywhere.

4116
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:30,200
It only took two days to write it, and now we can't find the sticky notes.

4117
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,200
We have to write it again.

4118
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,200
So we will get you that.

4119
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,200
We will get you that.

4120
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:38,800
And I haven't uploaded all the evidence yet, like all the recordings that we have and

4121
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:47,280
all the video recordings, audio and video.

4122
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:54,040
So, the last time I checked the email address, I didn't see anything, but that was before

4123
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,040
I left.

4124
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,040
You didn't see anything?

4125
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,040
No.

4126
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,040
I sent it to you.

4127
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:02,400
I sent it to that email address on Sunday night, and I checked on Monday to get anything

4128
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,400
yet.

4129
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:08,480
But you don't, this should be, I sent you like a shitload of stuff last night, last night.

4130
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,480
Oh, last night?

4131
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:10,480
Yeah.

4132
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,480
Okay.

4133
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,480
I haven't checked it.

4134
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:13,480
Oh, okay.

4135
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:14,480
Because I haven't been flying in a year.

4136
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:15,480
It's okay.

4137
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,480
I sent you the text saying, I'm sorry, I just saw this now.

4138
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:17,480
Yeah.

4139
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:18,480
That's what I'm saying.

4140
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,480
Yeah.

4141
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:20,480
I haven't checked whatever it is you sent.

4142
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,480
Okay, good.

4143
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:22,480
Okay.

4144
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,480
You've got a lot, there's a lot of reading in there.

4145
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,480
You'll see.

4146
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:25,480
But you've read the report, though.

4147
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:30,480
I don't have, if you sent the report in that group, I haven't read it yet.

4148
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:31,480
The good report?

4149
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,480
No.

4150
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,480
So, yeah, I just have a good report.

4151
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,480
Oh, good.

4152
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,480
Okay.

4153
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:36,480
So, you sort of, oh, good.

4154
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,480
I got to you first.

4155
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:38,480
That's good.

4156
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,480
So, you get your first impression from me first.

4157
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:40,480
Not that report.

4158
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:41,480
That's a good sign for me.

4159
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:42,480
Very happy to hear that.

4160
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,480
That's good.

4161
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:48,480
So, we can do some more research on our insights, see what thing you have.

4162
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:49,480
Good.

4163
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:51,480
I can't promise anything else, but I cannot promise my own right.

4164
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:54,480
Like, I can't promise that I mean you don't need all of that help at all.

4165
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,480
That's good to me.

4166
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,480
But I can't tell you I'll be honest, right?

4167
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,480
I'll be honest with you about what we can do and what we can't do.

4168
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:02,480
And, I'll give you some options sometimes and say, well, we can try this and try that.

4169
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:05,480
It may include to different ways.

4170
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:09,480
But I can't promise what I promise what we can do.

4171
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,480
I got that.

4172
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,480
Um, Look, what do you want if you want it?

4173
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:19,960
What did you have on there that you wanted to show up?

4174
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:22,080
Seriously, it will be here all week.

4175
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,000
OK, can you even find it in summary,

4176
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,520
like the overview of what you see?

4177
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,000
Do you like political shit?

4178
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,280
Or do you like give me a genre?

4179
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:34,200
I work in cyber crime.

4180
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,040
Oh, you do?

4181
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,840
OK, that's what I thought.

4182
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,600
You read it on that article, I know.

4183
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,080
So you're going to do that part, right?

4184
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,520
So I work in cyber crime.

4185
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,800
So we look for hackers.

4186
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,360
We do ransomware, or BTC, and jacking.

4187
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,360
Oh, you do?

4188
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:50,360
Really?

4189
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:54,160
Yeah, we do much other stuff, like computer issues in general.

4190
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,640
I do some stalking pieces.

4191
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:58,120
Do you have all the toys in tact shit, too?

4192
01:55:58,120 --> 01:55:59,440
I've got a lot of toys.

4193
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:00,200
Oh, really?

4194
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:01,000
OK.

4195
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:01,520
But yeah.

4196
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:02,800
Dude, OK.

4197
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,720
Do you need like an apprentice?

4198
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,720
All right.

4199
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:09,320
Do you want to come out to QC and see all the toys we have?

4200
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:13,640
In our hand presses, and then you ask the whole band to give them out.

4201
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:15,040
Well, yeah, OK.

4202
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,600
OK, yeah, well, I can help you.

4203
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,880
I'm a self-taught hacker.

4204
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,840
I'm not very good.

4205
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,480
I did not hack Sony, OK?

4206
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,640
I did not do that.

4207
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:26,240
They was accused of that, but I did not do that.

4208
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,080
The stuff on DDoS Secrets, I was stupid enough to say,

4209
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,280
I'm like, can you actually give me credit for my stuff?

4210
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,400
Can you put my name?

4211
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:37,880
I'm the only idiot that said, here, put my name on it.

4212
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:42,800
But MPS, Monty Duposky, that was not a hack of the documents

4213
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,000
were given to me by the Anatella Rossi.

4214
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,320
So it was not a hack.

4215
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,840
And she said, I want you to make this public as possible,

4216
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:53,320
because we dated Rossi's story out there.

4217
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:54,480
So I said, of course.

4218
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,960
And she knew I had connections with New York Times,

4219
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,760
and most returnals, and that's what she wanted.

4220
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:03,680
So I helped her, and Luca was her lawyer.

4221
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:07,560
It seems like a very, like you walk in one light bulb

4222
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,600
on this old ancient desk, smoking a cigarette,

4223
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:15,720
speaking Italian, perfectly safe of a lawyer.

4224
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:17,760
He also wanted all this everywhere.

4225
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:21,280
He wanted me to disseminate as much as I could.

4226
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,600
We had a deal.

4227
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,960
I said, if you can give me anything in McKaylee Faisola,

4228
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,560
anything in my father, anything you got,

4229
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:29,120
I'll give you whatever I have.

4230
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:32,200
And I don't really, let's look for David Rossi.

4231
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,200
I don't have much in here.

4232
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:35,320
If you want to do it, you can do it right now.

4233
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:36,520
So that was our trade.

4234
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:39,400
And man, I told you in town, but he told me

4235
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,040
the craziest fucking story.

4236
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:44,680
It'll take a long time to tell you the story.

4237
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:50,040
The short version is that Monty Duposky, the Calabria mafia,

4238
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:54,560
is using MPS to launder their money.

4239
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:59,120
And they're using it in very interesting and creative ways,

4240
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:01,520
like putting cash in basketballs for the Italian basketball

4241
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,080
team.

4242
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:06,400
Literally, they'll have basketballs filled with cash.

4243
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:09,600
And then they give the basketballs to some other team.

4244
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,520
They trade them with other basketballs.

4245
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,280
And that's how they do the cash exchange.

4246
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,440
Fucking weird.

4247
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:15,920
I swear to God.

4248
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,440
And we've got David Rossi.

4249
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,800
And Anatella says this happened.

4250
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,120
And Luca says this is what happened.

4251
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:25,760
David Rossi would pick up just a briefcase full of cash.

4252
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:26,440
He'd rent a car.

4253
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:29,640
He would drive from Siena to Lugano.

4254
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:33,600
And he would just start dumping cash into different accounts.

4255
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:37,640
And then one guy that picked up the cash count

4256
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:42,840
is Cardinal Scorano from the Vatican, caught on CCTV.

4257
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:43,800
And he's laundering money.

4258
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:46,960
He's got a history of being a dirty banker as well.

4259
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,040
So this is very interesting.

4260
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,480
But no one's gone after him the second time.

4261
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:51,920
He's got to go.

4262
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,960
Or has to mention that he doesn't go.

4263
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:56,240
Both of them.

4264
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,600
And how do you know what to tell him?

4265
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,640
I went over and then visited her.

4266
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:04,320
When I was a, it's a really, it's another story

4267
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,040
if you want to have a story time.

4268
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:09,680
But I was trapped in Amsterdam.

4269
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:12,760
Like literally trapped in a fucking campsite.

4270
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:15,240
Someone broke into my rental car and stole,

4271
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:19,120
like I had this computer in black case, Macbook,

4272
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:21,840
and it was underneath the passenger seat.

4273
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,600
And it's the dead of night in Amsterdam.

4274
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:27,000
Like 3 AM, I'm going into town and I buy some cigarettes.

4275
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,080
So I leave the car for a little, maybe 10 minutes.

4276
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:33,240
And I walk back and cobblestone streets and I see glass.

4277
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,840
I say, oh, poor fucker, guys, car broke in.

4278
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:36,880
It's mine.

4279
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,800
No, they did not take my passport.

4280
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,560
They did not take my 30 or 40 euros.

4281
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:45,040
You know, sitting in that little tray between the passenger

4282
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,120
and the driver's mind.

4283
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:49,200
They didn't take my fender strad in the back seat

4284
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,400
or anything else.

4285
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,480
They only took that computer, which I have a dutch bank

4286
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,840
stuff that I had just bought in New York City

4287
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,400
a month and a half prior.

4288
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:00,680
And I just organized all my dutch bank shit,

4289
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,240
all the files on that computer.

4290
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:03,080
It was encrypted.

4291
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:04,720
There's no way anyone can get to it.

4292
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,520
And anyone that would pull off something like that,

4293
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:09,360
it's got to be a shitty private investigator.

4294
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,760
There's no, anyone that's sophisticated

4295
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:12,800
would have just fucking hacked it, you know,

4296
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,600
or given up on anyone saying it was encrypted.

4297
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:15,440
There's no way in.

4298
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:16,640
It was air gap, I forgot to say.

4299
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,480
There's no way.

4300
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,080
But that's the only thing that was taken.

4301
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,240
And I suspect dutch bank hired a private investigator.

4302
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:24,640
That's where I think.

4303
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:29,000
In Prague, I thought I was gonna die

4304
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,560
when this guy, Italian thug, pulls me out of the car

4305
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,000
and starts beating on me.

4306
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,040
And he doesn't speak a word of English.

4307
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:41,440
I just came to buy some car to the mall in Czechoslovakia.

4308
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,920
Have you ever been to a mall in Prague?

4309
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,400
It's fucking weird.

4310
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:46,480
It's a weird place.

4311
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:47,720
I once died on a train.

4312
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,880
Oh, in Prague?

4313
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,200
What happened?

4314
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,040
I got to get off.

4315
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:51,880
No, no.

4316
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,440
I ended up in a train.

4317
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:54,280
That's not good.

4318
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,600
It was not good.

4319
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,880
No, it was like, it was bad.

4320
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:01,120
Yeah, I hit the SOS button in the car, like,

4321
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:02,520
help, I'm being murdered.

4322
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:03,800
This guy's gonna murder me.

4323
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:05,320
And I forgot, I had bought a fake gun,

4324
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:06,880
like a BB gun in Germany.

4325
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:08,840
And I never, I don't know anything about guns,

4326
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,560
but I should have used it.

4327
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:11,800
Maybe he would have run away,

4328
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:14,080
but I forgot it was in the fucking apartment.

4329
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:16,320
So instead I'm just like, I use my phone.

4330
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,320
Look, you're on camera.

4331
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:18,600
Stop kicking me, stop this.

4332
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:20,160
You're being on camera.

4333
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:22,720
And the SOS, here's it all.

4334
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:25,040
And next thing I know, the fucking SWAT teams.

4335
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,120
They got machine guns, there's six of them.

4336
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:29,160
And they surround us, and they tell the guy,

4337
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,800
he has fucking hands up, and I'm like,

4338
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:34,400
that's the guy, we know that's the guy.

4339
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,520
They're speaking English.

4340
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:39,160
And then the dude does the strangest thing.

4341
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:42,720
He's surrounded by the SWAT team, with M16s,

4342
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,400
wherever those big guns are.

4343
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:48,680
He takes off his shirt, so you can see he's topless, right?

4344
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:49,920
Why does he take off his shirt?

4345
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,160
Cause he's got military tattoos.

4346
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,240
This is how he's going to communicate to the Czech police

4347
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:55,640
that I'm one of you.

4348
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,920
That's what he did in 20 of the time he looked

4349
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,680
at the EU military, some sort of service.

4350
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:02,240
And they put down the gun, it works.

4351
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:04,320
They're like, what is going on here?

4352
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:07,120
Turns out, we take over the police station,

4353
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:11,800
and like a fucking lady from a central casting,

4354
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:13,680
Interpol, shows up, you know?

4355
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:16,640
He's like, I don't want to be here in a sunday or anything.

4356
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:19,920
Get me, who's this stupid American, you know, sorry.

4357
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,440
Turns out he's from Avis rental car,

4358
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,720
and he just came to repo the car.

4359
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,960
That's the fucking crazy shit that it was, man.

4360
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,840
It was a weird time, you know?

4361
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,960
I don't know why I told you that story, but it's fine.

4362
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,480
What was the question?

4363
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,320
Sorry.

4364
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:34,160
Let's go back to your hacking system.

4365
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:35,000
Oh, hacking?

4366
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:35,840
Yes.

4367
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,720
What kind of skills do you know,

4368
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:38,920
what kind of techniques do you know?

4369
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:42,160
Well, I guess my, the only one I pulled off,

4370
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:44,960
like really successfully was my mother.

4371
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:48,160
But we had a lot of time in planning, though.

4372
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:50,320
It was just a man in the middle of watching my hack.

4373
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,200
It was really easy.

4374
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,480
Was it a Wi-Fi fan app or something?

4375
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:54,920
I have a pineapple, but I did not use a pineapple.

4376
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,800
I could not, I was like, I had no money, I had nothing.

4377
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:01,760
I had to learn how to increase the output of my battery

4378
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,920
power on the MacBook to handle all the fucking thoroughfare

4379
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,720
that was coming in through the,

4380
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:09,640
well, I had practiced at this hotel down there.

4381
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:12,720
They called the, in Venice Beach,

4382
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:16,960
but it was a, I spoofed their,

4383
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:22,560
it's in Manhattan Beach,

4384
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,240
and it was where I learned everything for two weeks.

4385
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:27,720
Anyway, I spoofed the router,

4386
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:29,800
and I learned Wireshark at that time,

4387
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,400
which was like driving me crazy

4388
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,920
because all I got were the packets,

4389
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:35,280
but I could not figure out how to put the packets together

4390
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,360
and took me, like, maybe I'm slow, I don't know,

4391
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,560
but it took me a while to figure out

4392
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:41,040
how to put the fucking packets together.

4393
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,440
And once I did, I was like, shit, I have passwords now.

4394
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:47,160
I have some, well, not full passwords,

4395
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,440
they're still broken up,

4396
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:51,920
but you can just put them into a algorithm that will,

4397
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:56,240
yeah, John the Ripper or something,

4398
02:03:56,240 --> 02:03:59,600
anything that's, actually, John the Ripper won't work,

4399
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:03,200
it's more like a, I don't know, it's,

4400
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,640
Sorry?

4401
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:05,800
Rainbow table?

4402
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,520
No, the table one, that's not very easy one,

4403
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:11,440
the table hack, that's the injection one,

4404
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:14,080
were you in CaliLinux, you're talking about?

4405
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:17,320
Yeah, it's been a long time since I took that class,

4406
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,520
but I thought you're just running it

4407
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,040
against a dictionary or something?

4408
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,600
Yeah, well, you are, but you also had an algorithm

4409
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,200
that's specific to what you're looking for.

4410
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,360
Like, I knew my mom's,

4411
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:29,120
my mom would have a very specific list

4412
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,400
of names she would use, right?

4413
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:32,440
So I had to plug in just those,

4414
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:34,400
and I had to have the, you know,

4415
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,320
anything over eight fucking,

4416
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,360
it's good we can talk a little bit, this is fun,

4417
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:41,000
anything over eight letters is gonna take over

4418
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,760
a day and a half, unless you have a 20 gig GEX,

4419
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,680
whatever, NVIDIA card, you know,

4420
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:50,240
that's with Elkumsoft, which is the fastest

4421
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:52,160
password cracker I've seen so far right now,

4422
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:54,320
on the market, I'm sure you guys

4423
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,960
probably have access to something cooler than that,

4424
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:58,400
but it takes a long time.

4425
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,400
But it's a lot of it, you just have to use your intuition

4426
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:03,480
or make a phone call, you know, I didn't say you,

4427
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:06,800
you know, that's the best way to do it is this,

4428
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,960
they call it social engineering,

4429
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,360
so that's the most fun way to do it.

4430
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,680
How do you learn, like, do you take classes?

4431
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:17,880
You too, we don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

4432
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:22,120
I was, you don't understand, my dad just killed himself,

4433
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:25,200
my mom cut me out of the family,

4434
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:28,920
I was sequestered to rehab, it was a very nice rehab,

4435
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:32,040
but I was not free, I was like, for four months,

4436
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,520
I'd say that.

4437
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,640
You're a whole lot more than me,

4438
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,920
I've taken the classes that you and I,

4439
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:38,680
I don't understand everything.

4440
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:42,280
But I had to, it was like, if you have no money

4441
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:43,480
and you have to feed yourself

4442
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,960
and someone throws you in a foreign country,

4443
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:47,360
you're gonna learn, you know, that's what it was for me,

4444
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,240
it was like, I had to know why my dad killed himself,

4445
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:51,760
I had to figure it out, I had to get into his email,

4446
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,720
so I just sat down and fucking focused.

4447
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:56,600
I was impressed, I was like,

4448
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:57,760
I was planning on killing myself,

4449
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,120
you know what, maybe my mom will learn something

4450
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:01,600
if I die the same year, you know,

4451
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:03,160
maybe my sister will never have the stuff,

4452
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:04,800
I was being a martyr, you know,

4453
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:07,440
I was being a little shit too, being an asshole.

4454
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:10,480
And the doctor said, you know what Val,

4455
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:11,920
we're gonna try and give you out or all,

4456
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:15,080
let's see what this does, what the fuck that was like.

4457
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:17,440
You know, and then I take it, I'm playing,

4458
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,000
three hours like that.

4459
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,200
All right, let's learn cocking, you know,

4460
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:22,320
finance is next.

4461
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,880
And you know what, it fucking saved my life that thing,

4462
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,400
it really did, I drugged,

4463
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,560
and people say don't be drugs,

4464
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:30,960
but sometimes drugs really work, it shows you.

4465
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,840
Yeah, if you're depressed, you don't see any hope,

4466
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:36,720
sometimes the drug will just give you a glimpse

4467
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,800
and remind you that there is another way

4468
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:42,240
of viewing the world, you know, that's it.

4469
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:44,280
But anyway, yeah, I was fueled with out or all,

4470
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:45,320
it was very helpful.

4471
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:50,040
Yeah, I found focus, I never, like I was a dumb musician,

4472
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:52,400
I thought I had, there's no way I was gonna learn

4473
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,440
how a derivative work, right?

4474
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:57,040
I had no fucking, I was very proud of myself,

4475
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,600
and I thought my father was very proud too,

4476
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:01,320
and that's kind of another thing, kind of,

4477
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:03,960
you know, a little fuel, a fuel to the fire.

4478
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:08,000
So what other things really need to happen?

4479
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,960
Like, do you know anything about ransomware?

4480
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:14,480
I do, yeah, I stay away from it, it sounds,

4481
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,160
I mean, it sounds like it's really,

4482
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:18,960
it's not, I mean, I've never had anything around somewhere,

4483
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,160
but it doesn't seem like a difficult thing to break,

4484
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:24,200
I mean, it's gotta be localized on the computer

4485
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:26,480
and you can isolate it, it's not,

4486
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,080
if you take the computer offline,

4487
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:30,720
it's not like a self-destruct button

4488
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:34,800
that where all of a sudden your computer's gone dead,

4489
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,120
you can isolate the fucking hack.

4490
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,360
It's just like anything, you know, any virus.

4491
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,640
Well, not like any virus, I don't know much about it,

4492
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:44,560
but if someone's putting a foreign code

4493
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:46,440
onto your computer, it's depending where it is,

4494
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,200
and again, remember, there's different types,

4495
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,640
and with Intel, the new shit we learned about Intel,

4496
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:53,880
with the hack on the chips, there's a whole new,

4497
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,720
it's like a whole new industry, but there's a whole new,

4498
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,440
what's the word, like a way to get at data,

4499
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:05,560
I can't remember the names of them

4500
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:07,920
because it's, my brain's on 100% today,

4501
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:09,720
but the ones, the Intel chips, the flaws

4502
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:12,000
that were found about a year and a half ago,

4503
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,120
do you remember what you know what I'm talking about?

4504
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:13,960
The vulnerability, thank you.

4505
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:14,800
What's it called?

4506
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:15,640
Vulnerability?

4507
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:17,480
Yeah, but what were the names of the ghost one?

4508
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:18,600
Well, no, no, no, I don't,

4509
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:21,240
I think the noise might be one of these problems.

4510
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:22,960
So the things Intel fucked up,

4511
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:25,120
and from the very beginning when we started making chips,

4512
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:30,120
there was a cache, or a cache, or whether you can,

4513
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,800
yes, we could get all the credentials back

4514
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:36,120
from the actual chip, and every single computer

4515
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:39,240
in the world is vulnerable to this, every single computer,

4516
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:41,000
and that's fucking amazing, right?

4517
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,080
So that gives you completely new access,

4518
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:45,840
and three different companies found this out at the same time.

4519
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,640
It's like the 100th monkey hearing.

4520
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:49,440
Do you know the thing?

4521
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:50,280
The 100th monkey?

4522
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,120
Yeah, the 100th monkey.

4523
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:54,520
Great, yeah, it's just, the idea has sort of happened.

4524
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,760
But anyway, yeah, that's a whole new way of doing it.

4525
02:08:56,760 --> 02:08:57,760
I know how to do,

4526
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:02,160
my best thing is social engineering,

4527
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:05,560
and then, you know, I'm not really a coder.

4528
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,400
I don't know how to do it,

4529
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:09,160
but I can take other people's programs

4530
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:11,680
and use them very well, you know?

4531
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:14,200
Elk and Soft kind of pisses me off a little bit.

4532
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:16,520
These guys, they overdo it, but,

4533
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:19,440
I mean, I have magnet, I have Elk and Soft,

4534
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:23,000
I have the orange one.

4535
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:26,520
I can't remember, I can't remember what it's called.

4536
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:29,440
Belk is off, there's no issue, you know what?

4537
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,280
Oh, you know what?

4538
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:33,160
I'll show you, I'll show you what I got.

4539
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:35,120
You know, magnet is the best right now.

4540
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:37,440
See, and I'm thinking, like, why go through,

4541
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:40,800
why do all this extra work you don't need to do

4542
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,040
if you can just get the fucking,

4543
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,240
someone's already built the program,

4544
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:46,200
we'll go out there and invent the wheel, right?

4545
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:51,200
So if, for example, if Elk and Soft, oh shit,

4546
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:53,360
let me see the options,

4547
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:58,600
if Elk and Soft is already created a way

4548
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:02,040
to get the tar ball off your iPhone 11,

4549
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:04,120
why do I have to create a program

4550
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:04,960
that do the same thing,

4551
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,920
that you've got people that spend a lot of time

4552
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:08,080
and money doing it?

4553
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,280
So I'll just use their shit

4554
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,240
and improvise with other people's shit.

4555
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:14,640
Like, the pineapple is not that great, you know?

4556
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,640
It's not that interesting.

4557
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:20,520
And also it's a little, it's not user-friendly, you know?

4558
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,520
It's like you have to really sit down and study

4559
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:25,120
the fucking stick of pineapple and what not to do it.

4560
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:28,160
So I build a, like a fast way to do it for my girlfriend

4561
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:29,120
because she wanted to know how to do it,

4562
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,520
but she had no patience to sit down

4563
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:35,520
and learn how to keep the AP or the evil twin thing.

4564
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:38,520
You know, so I just showed her like a,

4565
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:42,600
I created like a shortcut for her, which is sort of-

4566
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:47,840
How did you make it easier for her from Bernie?

4567
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,000
I automated it, yeah.

4568
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,400
It's easier if you do that,

4569
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:52,720
because she just does one thing,

4570
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:55,120
everything falls into place instead of making her,

4571
02:10:55,120 --> 02:10:58,240
it makes her think like she's accomplished something, you know?

4572
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:02,120
It's not that hard to just automate, let me see, you know.

4573
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:05,560
Sorry, so let me show you, for example.

4574
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,360
Oh, Evan Tree was the other one.

4575
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:10,920
The other one is her Wi-Fi off, it's Bluetooth off.

4576
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:11,760
Oh, yeah.

4577
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:13,560
Of course, of course.

4578
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:15,600
Your security and ours, but-

4579
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:17,240
Oh, really?

4580
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:19,280
You guys got people, interesting.

4581
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,600
Yeah, I mean, I think, sorry, I got all excited,

4582
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:25,000
but I forgot that you guys were with the FBI.

4583
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Shit, okay, yeah, Wi-Fi's off, Bluetooth is off.

4584
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,120
So let's pull up, like phone breaker,

4585
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:41,720
Xcode, I can do, I don't know,

4586
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:43,840
can you be more specific, is there something you're looking for?

4587
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,360
It's not 10, it says your level of skill

4588
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,080
would like need your help to do something.

4589
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:47,920
Okay.

4590
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:51,080
You know, we needed you to look at, you know,

4591
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:52,520
vulnerable website or something like that,

4592
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,040
is that something you could do?

4593
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:54,880
Oh.

4594
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:57,080
You know, if we had a phone, we'd be pretty good.

4595
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,640
The phone I could do a lot better

4596
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:00,960
than I could with the vulnerable website.

4597
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,320
I could do the website, but it would take me a little extra time,

4598
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:05,680
because I have not studied that one as much.

4599
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:07,840
I mean, I used to do it before,

4600
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,720
maybe when it was easy, when everything was on the server,

4601
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:13,800
and you could just do it for the back space.

4602
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,400
Remember, you could just do that stupid thing,

4603
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,440
you know, maybe I could do that.

4604
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:19,240
But the phone is more fun for me, that's easy,

4605
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:22,040
that's not easy, but it's more of a challenge.

4606
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:24,840
Because I did my dad's phone, I did my girlfriend's phone,

4607
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:26,920
and then people would find phones on the street for me

4608
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:29,400
and just sell it to me, it's just like a friend practice.

4609
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,720
It is fun, that's what I like.

4610
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,360
And the remote stuff is,

4611
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:38,160
well, am I gonna get in trouble

4612
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:40,240
for telling you guys something this short?

4613
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:41,920
He told me like you murdered someone,

4614
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:42,960
they probably didn't believe you.

4615
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:44,800
I never murdered anybody, okay?

4616
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:46,520
No murder, okay?

4617
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:53,120
The New York Times asked me to hack Epstein.

4618
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:55,160
Okay, so they didn't want me to hack Epstein.

4619
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:59,200
So I did it, and everyone's very,

4620
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:01,120
I didn't, oh sorry, I didn't do it.

4621
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:04,280
I started the process of doing it,

4622
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:06,400
and I gave him the list of passwords,

4623
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,440
and I gave him the list,

4624
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:09,200
and I have this on email to prove to you,

4625
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,680
okay, the passwords, and I gave him the list of logins,

4626
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:13,440
that's it, all the credentials.

4627
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:16,360
And I gave him the Gislane's credentials as well.

4628
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:19,840
I did not break in, I did try, okay, made an attempt,

4629
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:23,320
but it was a double authentication,

4630
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:25,440
someone already got to it.

4631
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,660
I don't know whose number it is,

4632
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:28,920
but I have a phone number if you wanna trace it,

4633
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:30,480
it would be helpful for you guys.

4634
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:36,640
And I found out a lot, for Kevin Hall,

4635
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:38,720
actually, I did this one in the morning.

4636
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:40,800
I know someone who's running around, so.

4637
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,640
Oh, Kevin Hall is doing this one in the morning,

4638
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:48,600
and he's a partner with me,

4639
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:50,360
she wrote the Epstein story.

4640
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:57,640
Yeah, she's really good, really good, yeah.

4641
02:13:57,880 --> 02:13:59,880
I didn't wanna know if someone was running around,

4642
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,520
but I helped him by just looking at his old email addresses

4643
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:08,440
from like 1999, old banks that he used in old,

4644
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:13,520
just old accounts, and lawyers that he used as well,

4645
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:16,120
because a lot of the lawyers are hiding some money too.

4646
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,760
Stuff like that, yeah.

4647
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:24,000
Just, you know, I usually don't give away a secret,

4648
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,240
but I'll give you a secret,

4649
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:27,360
and it'll make it seem so mundane and obvious to you,

4650
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,320
you'll think like, why didn't I think of that?

4651
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:31,280
It's the easiest possible way to start,

4652
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:33,960
and mostly, people ask you to find a password,

4653
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,240
this is the easiest thing to do.

4654
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:38,960
You just get a database of the billion or so

4655
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,600
already hacked files,

4656
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:43,480
you find the old password that somebody used,

4657
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,600
and you just sort of engineer from there,

4658
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:47,760
it's not that hard, yeah.

4659
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,280
A lot of people don't change their passwords,

4660
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:52,160
and when they do, they make a variation.

4661
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,000
That's all you have.

4662
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,840
Right.

4663
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:57,720
I used to usually work alone, you work with other people?

4664
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:02,720
No, no, I don't understand how you work with,

4665
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:07,200
I mean, teach me, there's a way to work with other people,

4666
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,280
yeah, teach me, because usually, I don't know,

4667
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:12,080
like usually it's one person doing all the work,

4668
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:14,960
and the other person is watching, so, I don't know.

4669
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:22,440
But yeah, I'd like to, I would love to try, I mean.

4670
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:25,080
Yeah, like I said, right now I'm completely list of stuff

4671
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:27,680
that like, okay, we could use help on this,

4672
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:29,320
so it's maybe something that we could do.

4673
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:31,360
We could try to find a spot for you, still.

4674
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,160
I feel like it's that, I guess, on my head.

4675
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:36,200
What I'm really good at doing is I could find

4676
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:37,920
stolen money and money laundering.

4677
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:39,280
If someone needs to move money,

4678
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:40,680
I can show you how to do that.

4679
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:44,080
I know how to, I know people that can reverse engineer,

4680
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:48,160
there's a word for it, Bitcoin wallets?

4681
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:49,920
Reverse growth, what do you call it?

4682
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:51,840
Well, how do they, how do they,

4683
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:54,320
I mean, if they're gonna track where the Bitcoin goes,

4684
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:58,200
no, they can find, no, how, where it came from.

4685
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:00,840
They can do the whole scrub, they call it,

4686
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,000
it's not scrub, it's called the,

4687
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,240
they're watching it now, like you're telling,

4688
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:08,840
because it's all public, so that you can see

4689
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:09,720
where it goes to and from,

4690
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:11,400
you mean after it's been tumbled or something?

4691
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:12,720
After it's been, yes.

4692
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:15,240
Not tumbled, after it's been put into any wallet.

4693
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:18,640
They can trace it, like a reverse trace.

4694
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:20,600
There's two people I know that can do it.

4695
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,600
That part's not too difficult, I'll tell you.

4696
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:23,440
It's not, okay.

4697
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:24,920
Oh, you can?

4698
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,400
Okay, I don't know anything about it.

4699
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:27,880
And it's just like the ledger is public,

4700
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:30,040
so you can see where the money comes and goes to.

4701
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,160
It's just that this number means nothing.

4702
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:36,320
Oh, no, but it's not that simple.

4703
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:38,160
I mean, yeah, I know there's an open ledger,

4704
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:42,600
but it's also, there's like a wallet

4705
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:44,400
that has self-account as well,

4706
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:46,480
so you have to find out where it, yeah.

4707
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:47,800
It's like, they know how to do that.

4708
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,080
They can, they can,

4709
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:53,160
I'm not sure what the wording is.

4710
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,040
You see, that would be nice.

4711
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:57,280
I would like to know what the terms are for these things.

4712
02:16:57,280 --> 02:16:59,360
I know how to do it, I know what the action is,

4713
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:02,320
but I don't know the term, the term, the terminology.

4714
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:06,960
Okay, so what other stuff do you have access to?

4715
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,240
I mean, because you have access to a lot of journalists, right?

4716
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,600
And here's the thing.

4717
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:12,720
I don't really want to deal with journalists

4718
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:15,200
because it's the first-minute stuff that's there.

4719
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,360
Journalists have a lot of data.

4720
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:20,560
They're a very untapped source of data.

4721
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:22,560
You know, if you know how to say the right thing,

4722
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:25,080
you can get all, I got the guys in Russia,

4723
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:27,520
there was a spy on trial,

4724
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:29,800
he's a banker spy, and I got the guy

4725
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:32,040
to send me the whole fucking transcripts,

4726
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:33,040
court records, everything.

4727
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,360
You mean the journalist was able

4728
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:36,280
to get the court records in 2017?

4729
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:38,960
Yes, okay, yes, interesting.

4730
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:40,760
Journalists have a lot of shit,

4731
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:42,560
and they just sit on it and just goes,

4732
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:45,000
once the story's done, they forget about it.

4733
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:45,920
They don't need it anymore.

4734
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:50,080
So there's a huge fucking great source of information.

4735
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:52,840
Nobody even bothers to get it.

4736
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:54,760
But I know so many journalists now,

4737
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:56,400
and they're sending me shit all the time.

4738
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,800
People, I just have this guy named,

4739
02:17:58,800 --> 02:17:59,720
well, I'm not gonna tell you his name,

4740
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:00,920
because that would be kind of weird.

4741
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,160
It would be weird to do that, too.

4742
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:05,880
But he just found me on Twitter and said,

4743
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:08,880
Val, I think that there's some shady shit

4744
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:10,000
going on in the Bank of Ireland.

4745
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,360
Can you take a look at this one?

4746
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:12,920
And I guess, I take a look at it,

4747
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:17,920
and lo and behold, Wilbur Ross stole $35 billion

4748
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,280
from Bank of Ireland.

4749
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:22,960
Well, Wilbur Ross and his compatriots,

4750
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:27,960
but 23, he calls them hedge funds because they're not hedge

4751
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:31,160
funds, they're more like LSEs.

4752
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:34,560
But 23 of them that he owns, Wilbur Ross owns, okay?

4753
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:41,520
Bank of Ireland hid $35 billion in promissory bonds, sorry.

4754
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:46,920
He bought a portion of that bank for 1% for like,

4755
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:51,000
like something so touchy, like a couple billion dollars.

4756
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,840
And his, that share gave him access to $35 billion,

4757
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:57,720
which he pulled out, and it's fucking amazing.

4758
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:58,680
It's amazing.

4759
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:00,000
So look, I get shit like that,

4760
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,440
but then I get the weird spy people, you know?

4761
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:05,400
Like the crazy people, they're not crazy.

4762
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:07,640
They're, sometimes they're reading a script.

4763
02:19:07,640 --> 02:19:09,440
Like, I don't know if they're intelligence

4764
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:11,000
from corporate intelligence,

4765
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,680
or if they're actual state-run intelligence.

4766
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:14,040
I can't tell.

4767
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:16,000
Like this guy, Kaiser Soze, right?

4768
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:22,000
So he's, he did a very classic move where you,

4769
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:25,680
instead of going right for me, he goes to people around me,

4770
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:27,160
and then they start talking about,

4771
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:28,960
and I'm like, oh, who's this guy you're talking about?

4772
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:29,800
Right?

4773
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:30,640
And that's how I get hooked.

4774
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:32,840
And I saw that coming a mile away, right?

4775
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:34,600
So I was like, okay, I'm here.

4776
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:35,800
What do you want to say?

4777
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:37,520
And he won't tell me who's really moving.

4778
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:40,920
And he goes into this story, it's very specific,

4779
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:43,600
and it's very good, and I really wish it was true,

4780
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:44,960
but I don't believe it is.

4781
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,480
But I do believe that 60, the 40% of it,

4782
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:54,160
somewhere over this bridge of the 50% market, is true.

4783
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,360
It makes sense.

4784
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:57,720
Trump, there was a meeting in Deutsche Bank,

4785
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:59,400
he says, when my father was there,

4786
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:01,000
and he, it's a lie, my father was never there.

4787
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,600
I checked his schedule, he did not go to this meeting.

4788
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,800
And Jurgen Fitchison was not there either.

4789
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:06,960
He claims he was there.

4790
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:10,160
And two people from Natsutzky were there,

4791
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:12,040
and he was one of them, right?

4792
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:14,520
He says that they came in to buy a silo,

4793
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:18,600
which is a collateralized loan obligation.

4794
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:20,920
It's basically a structured product.

4795
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:25,920
It's a, it's a whole shitload of mortgages

4796
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,360
put together into one bundle that you can buy.

4797
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,680
And it's like a bank-to-bank thing.

4798
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:33,560
You can't, it probably gives no access to it.

4799
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:35,520
So they thought they were gonna get rid of this,

4800
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:38,800
this charge, and sell it to Natsutzky.

4801
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,720
And the guy said, well, the problem is,

4802
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:43,360
we don't want you to buy it, we just want you to look at it

4803
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:45,040
and tell us what you think.

4804
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,000
And tell us before you see the problem.

4805
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,560
So they looked at it and they saw that,

4806
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:51,560
to make this long story short,

4807
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:54,160
Donald Trump did not sign a consenting agreement.

4808
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:56,600
Okay, so if you have a,

4809
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:59,800
if you guys are all in a trust, right,

4810
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:02,040
that means that you're all shared,

4811
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:05,440
it's sort of the money that's pooled together.

4812
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:08,280
Let's say you wanted to borrow $5 million

4813
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:10,280
to start a golf course, right?

4814
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:12,040
But you don't tell these guys.

4815
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:13,800
You take it, you take the $5 million,

4816
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:14,640
you don't tell them,

4817
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:16,640
and you don't sign a consenting agreement.

4818
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:20,120
If you fail, they have to pay your debt, right?

4819
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:21,880
If you sign a consenting agreement,

4820
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:24,040
then they're free, right?

4821
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:26,680
They're not liable for your debt if you fail.

4822
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:27,520
But you made money,

4823
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:29,120
you bring it back in and put it in the pool,

4824
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:32,640
and everyone's very happy, except that you didn't,

4825
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:35,120
they overlooked the fact that you didn't sign this agreement.

4826
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:37,760
Now, Trump didn't sign three of them, right?

4827
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,400
Which means the people at Deutsche Bank

4828
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:43,440
and the high net worth individuals at DBTCA specifically

4829
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:46,080
will be very upset to know that,

4830
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,360
and it would cause them to run on DBTCA.

4831
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:52,800
Now, and DBTCA has $23 billion going for it,

4832
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:56,840
and they still don't have a fucking chief risk officer,

4833
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,480
all right, $23 billion.

4834
02:21:58,480 --> 02:22:03,480
That is a 700 person entity, all right?

4835
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:06,920
There's 25,000 Deutsche Bank America,

4836
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,800
700 people in DBTCA.

4837
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:11,520
It's very secretive, it's a weird place,

4838
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,080
and that's where my dad,

4839
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:15,120
that's where they put my father when he died,

4840
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:16,320
when he killed himself.

4841
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:19,480
There's a French guy that runs it,

4842
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:22,040
and he was supposedly at this meeting as well.

4843
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:26,360
Now, I'll just, fuck it, I'll just tell you.

4844
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:31,360
The first guy is Rebolyev, signed off on the loan, okay?

4845
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:35,280
The second one is, I don't believe him,

4846
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:37,840
because I fed him the answer, and I fucked up.

4847
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:40,280
You know when you say, oh, did you hear the word

4848
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:41,760
Victor Bexelberg in the room?

4849
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:43,520
He goes, oh yeah, that's it, right?

4850
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:45,320
Fuck, I shouldn't have said that, yeah.

4851
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:48,200
So he claims Victor Bexelberg was number two,

4852
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:50,000
and number three is interesting,

4853
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,040
I didn't believe him until yesterday,

4854
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:55,280
because something interesting happened yesterday.

4855
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:59,680
He said that Spare Bank signed on behalf,

4856
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:01,440
a person signed on behalf of Spare Bank,

4857
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:03,440
not anyone you've heard of, but as,

4858
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:06,760
sorry, I'm sorry, not Spare Bank, Gazprom.

4859
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:09,680
Gazprom is an entity signed off on a loan.

4860
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:11,000
I'm like, what the fuck, how can an entity

4861
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:11,840
sign off on a loan?

4862
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:13,120
I've never heard of that.

4863
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,680
Until yesterday, when this Irish guy I was telling about

4864
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:20,800
sends me a, they call it charges,

4865
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:23,720
they call it in Ireland, they call them charges mortgages,

4866
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:24,560
right?

4867
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:28,200
He sends me this, I have it right here if you wanna see it,

4868
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:34,040
this charge of some land that was sold in Ireland

4869
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:35,280
by Deutsche Bank.

4870
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:38,680
So Deutsche Bank, as a bank, is an entity liable for it.

4871
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:40,280
I was like, holy shit, it does,

4872
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:42,600
and that's very, I've never seen that before.

4873
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:44,640
And he asked me, I've never seen this before,

4874
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,040
and I have not answered him yet,

4875
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:48,120
I'm not gonna tell him yes, you know,

4876
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:50,000
because I don't know who the fuck he's doing,

4877
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,640
where his game is.

4878
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:54,840
He's telling me that he wants to find a proper journalist,

4879
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:56,640
he wants Roman Farrell, so I'm like, okay fine,

4880
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:58,880
here's Roman Farrell, give him a Roman Farrell,

4881
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:01,680
but he's still sending me documents, so I don't know.

4882
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:07,840
And it's, things like that happen a lot, so, yeah.

4883
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,000
So what do you wanna, like, you know,

4884
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,760
economic fraud type stuff, it's good information.

4885
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:14,880
If that's the case too, we'll probably pass it to

4886
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:17,320
an economic fraud agent, if you can help out too.

4887
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:19,080
That's right.

4888
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:21,800
What other, like, are you involved in any hacking groups?

4889
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:25,160
Do you know of any hacking groups that you can get into?

4890
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:26,400
Like, yeah, a dark net type thing.

4891
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:31,400
Well, I mean, is this like, what if I say yes, am I in trouble?

4892
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:34,840
Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's one group.

4893
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:37,440
Because obviously the FBI monitors a lot of these things,

4894
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:38,840
and you like to see, you know, what's going on.

4895
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:40,880
Yeah, you guys are in that signal group, aren't you?

4896
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,120
What signal group?

4897
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,760
Which one?

4898
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:45,680
There's a bunch of signal groups.

4899
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:48,640
There's one, I know there's some people that we checked,

4900
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,320
and there's some like, brand new,

4901
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:53,360
limited identities for some people,

4902
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:55,040
we don't know where they came from, so.

4903
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:57,280
I thought it was either FBI, or it was like,

4904
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,480
some spies or something, so I don't know.

4905
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:02,320
In the signal group, so the signal group,

4906
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:04,520
there's the less than you would get?

4907
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:05,920
Well, it's not, there's a couple of,

4908
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:08,680
more than one signal group, so there's a group of people,

4909
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:10,040
and they're not all hackers, it's like,

4910
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:13,000
it's a mix of very interesting people.

4911
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,600
Yeah, yeah, it's like, some of the greatest journalists,

4912
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:17,720
and some of the greatest hackers,

4913
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:19,280
and some of the greatest activists,

4914
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:21,160
some of the greatest writers, you know,

4915
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:24,360
and some just fucking fine, interesting people.

4916
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:25,800
You know, everyone's having a conversation,

4917
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:28,400
but specifically a hacking group, no.

4918
02:25:29,360 --> 02:25:32,160
But there's like, different variations of these signal groups,

4919
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,800
and this one is Barrett, so.

4920
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:34,920
When he said Houston, I was like,

4921
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:36,800
oh fuck, he's after Barrett Brown.

4922
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:40,040
Barrett's on the radar, I mean.

4923
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:40,880
Yeah?

4924
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:42,440
Like, but you know that, I mean,

4925
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:44,440
he's been arrested already.

4926
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:48,200
I know, he's in rehab right now, yeah, okay, good side, yeah.

4927
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:50,080
Well, what's Barrett up to, do you talk to him?

4928
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,320
Yeah, I talk to him all the time,

4929
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:53,600
he pisses me off, he's a little fucking shit,

4930
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,800
because he's supposed to write great,

4931
02:25:56,360 --> 02:26:00,800
huge, thunderous story against Val versus David Enridge,

4932
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:04,240
but she got too high, and just fucking forgot about it.

4933
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:06,680
Well, not forgot about it, just didn't do it.

4934
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,000
So, and he hasn't even apologized yet,

4935
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,400
so I'm very pissed off.

4936
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:16,400
And I've got reams and reams of texts with him, so, yeah.

4937
02:26:17,240 --> 02:26:19,440
And he's a good guy, but he doesn't know shit about computers.

4938
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:20,920
He's not an hacker.

4939
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:22,800
He's a pharmacist for a good day.

4940
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:24,840
Yeah, but he's a talker, he's not an hacker.

4941
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:27,520
No, you barely know how to do that.

4942
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:30,080
You couldn't find his key chain.

4943
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:31,200
You couldn't do his key chain.

4944
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:33,040
Seriously, he doesn't know shit.

4945
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,360
That's the funny part about Barrett,

4946
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:36,680
he doesn't know anything about computers.

4947
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:37,520
Yeah.

4948
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:38,520
So, just, like, sort of,

4949
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:40,280
what part of you have Barrett about?

4950
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:42,840
No, no, no, he's, you know, just,

4951
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:45,160
he's kind of like, the reason I have some respect for him

4952
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:47,800
is because he's sort of, like, on this vengeful path

4953
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:48,960
that I understand now.

4954
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:51,440
I've never been on a vengeful path before,

4955
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:54,000
but now I understand it, I've started it,

4956
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,400
and I know that's what he's doing too.

4957
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:58,480
Like, whatever happened with the FBI and him.

4958
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:00,520
But I don't know, I just think it's hilarious

4959
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:03,360
when he got raided and he was live on the webcam.

4960
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:04,840
I just thought that was funny, I don't know.

4961
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:06,640
But then he fucking, I told him,

4962
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:10,040
I actually recorded this conversation,

4963
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:12,640
I told him, like, look, dude, where you fucked up

4964
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:15,520
is where you went after the FBI agent's family.

4965
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:16,760
That was stupid.

4966
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:18,880
You must understand how dumb that was.

4967
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:20,840
Yes, but, you know, I was already

4968
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:22,080
gonna be put in jail anyway,

4969
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:25,280
so, come on, bro, you could have avoided a lot of shit

4970
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:27,400
if you just didn't do that stupid shit.

4971
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:30,120
So he's an ego that won't,

4972
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,240
that's his biggest issue, his ego.

4973
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:36,240
He can't drop it for a second.

4974
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:41,240
He doesn't have the humility or the ability to try.

4975
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:44,320
That's the problem.

4976
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:46,880
That's why you can't trust someone like that in here.

4977
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:49,000
Do you guys part of the top over signal?

4978
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,560
Yeah, yeah.

4979
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:52,560
Well, again, I was trying to help him.

4980
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:54,160
He had no, he's like homeless now,

4981
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:57,160
with his weird girlfriend, so I was trying to help him.

4982
02:27:57,160 --> 02:28:00,280
You know, I got him a couple of hotel rooms,

4983
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:02,120
I sent him some money, he was like, you know,

4984
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:05,480
and then my girlfriend goes out of her way to,

4985
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:07,760
sorry, now I'm just complaining, but she goes,

4986
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:09,600
out of her way to get him a place to live

4987
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,600
for like a month, so he's off the streets,

4988
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,640
he doesn't have to worry about food and shit,

4989
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:15,840
he can just work, because she's like,

4990
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:18,280
do the thing where he fucking promised he promised us,

4991
02:28:18,280 --> 02:28:19,880
like, here's a place to live.

4992
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:22,040
And instead of just going there and saying thank you

4993
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,400
and doing it, he just like,

4994
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:26,720
creates this whole chaotic thing of like,

4995
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:28,360
well, you didn't tell me to call this day,

4996
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:31,200
and you know, like this minutiae,

4997
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:32,720
so he sabotages the whole thing,

4998
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:33,640
and then at the end of the month,

4999
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:35,560
you know what, very, go fuck yourself.

5000
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:37,480
I don't, it's not opening anymore,

5001
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:40,040
the windows closed, it's done.

5002
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:42,400
And he's like, fuck you, I'm very, you know.

5003
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:44,120
No, and I ignore him, the more I ignore him,

5004
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:46,080
the more he wants your attention.

5005
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:47,320
We're seeing it right now,

5006
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:50,400
I mean, where in rehab, is it down or?

5007
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:54,240
Do you really want to know?

5008
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:55,760
I was just curious, I mean, like.

5009
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:57,720
You're like, what?

5010
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:59,000
No, maybe, you don't want to tell,

5011
02:28:59,000 --> 02:28:59,840
you don't have to tell.

5012
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:02,560
No, I, I, I think it's important,

5013
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:05,600
I think I want to know what and why.

5014
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:07,400
Like, if I'm going to take the accountability

5015
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:08,680
of doing something to somebody here,

5016
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:10,560
I'm just going to get in trouble if we're in jail,

5017
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:11,880
I would like to know who it is,

5018
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:13,880
why I'm doing it and what for it.

5019
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:14,720
You know what I mean?

5020
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:16,440
I get it, I mean, I'll tell you this right now,

5021
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:19,560
I can't tell you everything we do, right?

5022
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:20,960
Like I said, I'll be honest with you

5023
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:22,520
as much as you're going to be honest with me.

5024
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,240
I can't tell you the motivation behind

5025
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:26,120
every single question I ask,

5026
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:28,160
because there's a lot of things that the FBI does,

5027
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:31,400
like if we had an investigation into whatever,

5028
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:34,480
I don't know, call it Barrett Brown, for example.

5029
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:36,320
And you want to know why, and it's because,

5030
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:38,440
oh, we're going to arrest him tomorrow, right?

5031
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:40,720
And then you don't say, hey, Barrett, by the way,

5032
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,280
meet you in the FBI, I'm going to fuck you tomorrow.

5033
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:43,120
Yeah.

5034
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:44,960
It probably wouldn't go well for us, right?

5035
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:47,240
So that would have to be my choice, right?

5036
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:48,080
Yeah.

5037
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:51,280
So everything you could tell is totally up to you, right?

5038
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,120
Like I'm not forcing you to give anything,

5039
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:53,960
you're here on your own.

5040
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:56,200
Well, I'm not going to give you a Barrett Brown right now.

5041
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:57,920
If there's something that he's done

5042
02:29:57,920 --> 02:30:00,520
that you feel you want to know,

5043
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:02,280
or if this is a Vendetta thing,

5044
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:04,680
then I don't want to be part of the Vendetta.

5045
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:05,520
Don't worry about that.

5046
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:07,680
I mean, I'm trying to assess what information you have,

5047
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,360
because whenever he's up there, I'm in Houston, so like.

5048
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:12,400
Sure, you know, I've got a Jeremy Hammond,

5049
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:15,480
Greg House, all the guys, all these people.

5050
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:17,200
Because like that's the other thing we have to assess too,

5051
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:18,520
is if you're not willing to help.

5052
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:21,080
But Greg worked with you, Greg worked with you already.

5053
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:23,200
Greg worked with you guys.

5054
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:25,240
He's already been helpful, you know.

5055
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:26,080
Yeah, yeah.

5056
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,760
Like that's the thing is we're collecting

5057
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:29,760
a lot of information on a lot of different things, right?

5058
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:30,600
Right.

5059
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:33,280
So part of it is, it's going to be a one-way street

5060
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:34,280
of information this way.

5061
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:36,400
I can't give you all the information that's,

5062
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:38,840
so like if that's what you expect, then, you know,

5063
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:42,000
it's no hard feelings, and we part ways, and it's just fun.

5064
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,840
Because I can't tell you everything we do, because.

5065
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:45,680
I know, I don't.

5066
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,320
You don't know me, I don't know you either.

5067
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:49,160
I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.

5068
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:50,240
I don't.

5069
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:53,480
No expectations, I just, if it's something that is,

5070
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:59,800
if I mean, I'm going to be accountable for someone's life,

5071
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:02,840
I'd really like to think it through, you know.

5072
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:03,680
Yeah.

5073
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:06,480
I mean, if you want me to blindly follow orders.

5074
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:08,560
I mean, I will right now,

5075
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:11,040
because Marla's life is in jeopardy, of course.

5076
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:13,600
I'll do whatever the fuck you want to save Marla,

5077
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:16,080
but at a certain, after that, you know,

5078
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:18,240
I will have to draw a line or something.

5079
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:19,440
And I, so here's the thing,

5080
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:21,640
I want you to be as conscious of the decision.

5081
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:23,200
Let's take Marla's whole way out of the situation.

5082
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:24,040
Okay.

5083
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:26,840
And you resolve Marla, everything's both static.

5084
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:28,800
I want you to make the same decision as her then,

5085
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:29,680
as you would before that.

5086
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,400
Okay, well then, that depends on you.

5087
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:33,880
If I like you guys, and I believe that this is,

5088
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:36,840
you are like Tim and Jammy, and like you, again,

5089
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:40,800
if they told, sent you to me, then I'm trusting them.

5090
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,760
I believe you guys are the good people,

5091
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:45,280
because there are some bad people in the FBI.

5092
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,160
All right, there's some really fucking shits.

5093
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:49,760
In every, not just the FBI, but everywhere.

5094
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,680
And it's hard to find them and negotiate.

5095
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:53,560
And you know, my read on you right now

5096
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:56,240
is that you're a very highly intelligent guy.

5097
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:58,680
You know, but you're hiding something from me right now,

5098
02:31:58,680 --> 02:31:59,520
and you haven't still,

5099
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,560
you still haven't told me you're hiding something right now.

5100
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:02,720
And you are here to suss me out

5101
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,240
from a totally different point of view.

5102
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:06,320
I'm not sure what point of view that is.

5103
02:32:06,320 --> 02:32:08,600
And you are here to completely give

5104
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:10,240
the female point of view.

5105
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:11,440
Oh, wow.

5106
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:13,840
I'm joking.

5107
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:17,760
You have a whole other case that you need help on,

5108
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,320
which is not even related to this,

5109
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:21,400
but I'm trying to figure out what that is for.

5110
02:32:21,400 --> 02:32:23,840
But you seem more like a New York-style person,

5111
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,240
not an LA person.

5112
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:27,120
So I'm thinking you've got to be,

5113
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:29,480
you've got to be closer than Tim,

5114
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:32,040
and you've got to be with Desky and Lyne.

5115
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:35,480
No, not with Desky and Lyne.

5116
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:39,920
Anyway, so, but your thing's unrelated to their thing,

5117
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:40,760
right?

5118
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:42,440
My clothes?

5119
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:44,400
Okay.

5120
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:45,560
You're completely on it, like,

5121
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:46,880
right before off of those, it is.

5122
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:48,520
That's okay, but that's what you tell me,

5123
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:49,360
and then I,

5124
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:50,200
So, it's a matter of thinking.

5125
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:51,280
I'm trying to assess you.

5126
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:52,120
He, he, he, he.

5127
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:52,960
The wrong thing is,

5128
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:55,080
the people are being straight up.

5129
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:55,920
Yep.

5130
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:59,040
I mean, I think underlying related,

5131
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:00,520
you know, they're wrong,

5132
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:04,720
and we do this job for the right reasons.

5133
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:06,200
There are bad apples out there,

5134
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:09,160
and that's not what you've got across.

5135
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:10,040
That's right.

5136
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:15,440
I think the fact that when we listen to you,

5137
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:17,920
and we ask you questions about model,

5138
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:19,600
that's not a concern, you know?

5139
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:22,280
That's not even worse than having a family to report.

5140
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:24,040
And you've been through that.

5141
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:25,560
You know, you have a history.

5142
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:26,400
I have,

5143
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:28,440
but I have to also question you and think,

5144
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:30,440
well, you know, I mean, I could be any way,

5145
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:31,560
what if I'm the bad guy,

5146
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:32,760
and I'm sitting here talking to you.

5147
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:34,760
So do you have to figure out,

5148
02:33:34,760 --> 02:33:35,600
where am I,

5149
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:37,440
am I the good person or the bad person, right?

5150
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:38,640
I told you my side of the story.

5151
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:40,520
Of course, I'm gonna make myself look good.

5152
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:42,600
You guys have to do your background on me.

5153
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:44,120
So I figured, have you already done it?

5154
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:45,280
If I would not be sitting here,

5155
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:46,120
if you hadn't done it,

5156
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:48,040
I'd already figured out I was the good guy.

5157
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:49,800
So I'm gonna have to trust you on that.

5158
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:50,720
That's what I,

5159
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:53,760
now I could be jumping to conclusions here,

5160
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,720
but that's why I figured it is happening, right?

5161
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:57,000
So you're right on that part,

5162
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,560
because I wouldn't bring you in here

5163
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:01,040
in a situation like this,

5164
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:02,640
if you were my target, right?

5165
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:04,560
If you were my target, you were the rest of you.

5166
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:05,400
Right, right.

5167
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:07,320
That being said,

5168
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:09,520
we're still trying to figure each other out, right?

5169
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:10,360
Yeah.

5170
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:11,680
We need to figure out what our role is,

5171
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:12,920
and we're trying to figure out

5172
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:15,000
if you've got any information that can help us.

5173
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,400
So, what, oh, databases?

5174
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:19,640
Yes, I do have OCCP,

5175
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:23,080
and I did have all of MLA stuff too,

5176
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:25,560
Hunter.Log, actually it's still available,

5177
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:26,960
Hunter Archives.

5178
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:27,800
Okay.

5179
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:30,720
And the ICIJ,

5180
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:31,560
and I've got,

5181
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:34,720
I don't know, so that's the OCCP and,

5182
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:36,200
what's Hunter?

5183
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:37,440
If I could show up for a second,

5184
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:39,560
I'd have admin access to you.

5185
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:40,400
This is really good.

5186
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:41,740
I got all the shit that I,

5187
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:46,740
it was OCCP, yeah, thank you.

5188
02:34:48,320 --> 02:34:51,280
If you want my files,

5189
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,080
you've been helping me up with your admin access.

5190
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,280
I want to sell this shit, you know?

5191
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:57,120
I can't be stuck looking at half the document.

5192
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:59,480
If you want me to find the fucking money laundress,

5193
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:01,480
you need to see the whole breadth of the thing.

5194
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:03,360
I have to file the whole paper trail.

5195
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:05,160
So, that's it.

5196
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:06,800
So, what do they have on OCCP?

5197
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:07,640
I've heard about it.

5198
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:09,480
So much shit, so much shit.

5199
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:10,400
Dude, it's great.

5200
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:12,240
It's great, everything, everything.

5201
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:16,080
Every, I mean, all my papers, you know, everything.

5202
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:18,840
All my shit is there, you know?

5203
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,640
All of MLA stuff is there.

5204
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:25,000
So, Hunter Archives would be the OSC for MLA stuff.

5205
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,720
And then that's what we got.

5206
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:29,280
It was rated in Germany and one in America or something.

5207
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:30,120
Which is a shame,

5208
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:31,720
because it was like a public service at Archives.

5209
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:33,240
It was really good.

5210
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:38,320
But it's like a, that was her big coup d'etger out there,

5211
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:41,200
her big tiara on her head sort of thing.

5212
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:43,760
What's the word I'm talking about here?

5213
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:44,600
Her baby or what?

5214
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:45,760
Yeah, whatever it is.

5215
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:49,880
But it's also, that's like one 20th of the OCCP.

5216
02:35:49,880 --> 02:35:52,160
Who's at the best of what's the important?

5217
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:56,160
You know, I don't think she's important.

5218
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:57,440
Actually, I think she's full of shit.

5219
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:59,360
She says, oh, we used to work for the CIA,

5220
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,000
but I can't tell you.

5221
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,440
Like one of those old, you know, isn't that community?

5222
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:05,280
Did Emma Bester reeling or?

5223
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,200
I don't know, okay.

5224
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:09,280
All I know is that I think she is a,

5225
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:12,320
I'm still trying to figure out,

5226
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:16,280
in that, you know, in any pejorative manner.

5227
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:19,480
But I think she was a man first,

5228
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:21,320
and then became a woman, or was she a woman who became a,

5229
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:22,280
I don't even know that.

5230
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,920
I just know it's some sort of gender change.

5231
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:28,480
And I know that her boyfriend or girlfriend,

5232
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:30,960
I don't know if she was also a man first,

5233
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:33,680
but I do know that he slash she is kind of an asshole,

5234
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:34,640
and that's it.

5235
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:39,640
It's like the kind of person that asked for money,

5236
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:42,480
and then, like, we need money,

5237
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:44,360
we need help because we have an autistic child.

5238
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:46,360
And how do you say no to that?

5239
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:48,760
You know, but then they sort of say,

5240
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:52,960
go fuck yourself if you have an idea that they don't have.

5241
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:53,960
Like in this one group,

5242
02:36:53,960 --> 02:36:58,960
but a friend of mine was just trying to actually bear it.

5243
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:00,960
I was like, yeah, you know,

5244
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:04,560
what do we do, don't attack this person at this turn,

5245
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:05,400
that this,

5246
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:11,120
I'm sort of a lawyer that I can't think of.

5247
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:13,640
I'm using my speed here,

5248
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:17,000
but a nonprofit, some sort of nonprofit,

5249
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,200
don't attack the specific lawyer because he's a good guy.

5250
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:20,840
And then she says, fuck you, he's a terrible guy.

5251
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:22,480
You can attack whoever the fuck I want.

5252
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:27,080
And this is Emma's partner, it stops.

5253
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,520
You know, they're, they heard his or anything?

5254
02:37:30,520 --> 02:37:33,800
Zen, is there a fake name, X-A-N?

5255
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:34,640
No, X-A-N.

5256
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:37,840
Yeah, but I think she's, like,

5257
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:41,120
it was a whole, it's a dramatically stupid,

5258
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:43,680
but it's like, but there was this whole drama yesterday

5259
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:48,680
about she's working in a diner and she got sad

5260
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,760
and she started crying, she couldn't contain her feelings,

5261
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:55,120
and it was all melodramatic, and like, so what?

5262
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:55,960
What are you trying to say?

5263
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:57,880
If you want money, just say, can I have money?

5264
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:59,400
Because we will respect you more

5265
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:01,040
if you just come out and ask for it.

5266
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:02,840
Instead of telling us how sad you are,

5267
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:05,240
but you have to work in a diner, right?

5268
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:06,600
If you say, fuck you for saying that,

5269
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:08,960
and that's the sort of, no, I don't mean it, right?

5270
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:09,800
You just want it back?

5271
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:13,080
Yeah, yeah, you know, it's like, it's enough.

5272
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:14,320
You want money?

5273
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:18,800
Yeah, you know, and, yeah, so.

5274
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:21,160
So is it saying a hacker or is he just doing

5275
02:38:21,160 --> 02:38:25,160
one of these, yeah, to be honest with you, okay.

5276
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:30,160
I, so I felt like I hacked Deutsche Bank,

5277
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:31,640
although I didn't hack Deutsche Bank,

5278
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:34,120
I felt like I did a pretty good job of hacking it,

5279
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:36,440
not directly, I didn't go into their servers and do it,

5280
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:38,880
but I fucking hacked that bank.

5281
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:42,160
And it, well, not maybe in the sense of a hacker,

5282
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:43,480
you probably, if you're a proper hacker,

5283
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:44,320
you would not see it.

5284
02:38:44,320 --> 02:38:46,000
But in social engineering and all the people,

5285
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,440
when McKaylee Faisola went to jail,

5286
02:38:47,440 --> 02:38:49,640
I put the fucking bail, too, all right?

5287
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:52,600
I got all the data, exposed everything,

5288
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:53,840
and there's still more to come,

5289
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:55,360
which you don't know about, all right?

5290
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:56,920
There's a lot more to come, yes.

5291
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:01,160
So I, so when Emma's guy, I forgot his name,

5292
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:06,160
the Wolfsack, the Spanish guy, hacked the Cayman Islands,

5293
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:08,240
right?

5294
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:10,040
That was a great one, by the way, it's good stuff.

5295
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:12,200
What happened with Cayman?

5296
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:13,520
I just don't know about it.

5297
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:15,800
Well, for me, it was on this, you don't know about it?

5298
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:16,640
It was here, right?

5299
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:17,960
Yeah, yeah.

5300
02:39:17,960 --> 02:39:18,960
I missed it, I'm sorry.

5301
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:19,800
Oh, it's great.

5302
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:20,640
That's definitely hacking news.

5303
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:23,880
No, I guess this guy was on the service for like a year,

5304
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:26,200
and it was just, I think he took all the Bitcoin,

5305
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:27,480
like all of it.

5306
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:29,880
And so he said, hey, anybody out there hack a bank,

5307
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:32,400
I'm gonna give you $100,000 of Bitcoin.

5308
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:33,240
So I'm like, you know what?

5309
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:34,440
Hey, Emma, could you tell your friend,

5310
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:36,480
I think I deserve at least a run-in

5311
02:39:36,480 --> 02:39:38,320
for this $100,000 in Bitcoin,

5312
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:40,080
because although I did not hack Deutsche Bank,

5313
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:41,040
that's why I'm trying to work.

5314
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:42,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5315
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:43,840
And so Emma's like, no, you didn't,

5316
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,920
you didn't hack Deutsche Bank,

5317
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:47,720
but she didn't say, oh, let me pass on the message.

5318
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:49,400
She didn't say, oh, hold on a second,

5319
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:53,000
she just immediately responded as if she was the hacker.

5320
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:57,760
So I suspected that it's possible that she's the hacker.

5321
02:39:57,760 --> 02:39:58,800
I've always thought she was,

5322
02:39:58,800 --> 02:39:59,960
because I always ask her.

5323
02:40:01,400 --> 02:40:02,600
Like I'm incriminating myself,

5324
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:04,320
but I'm constantly asking like, Emma,

5325
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:05,560
can you figure out how to do this?

5326
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:06,600
Can you hack this shit for me?

5327
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:08,320
Because I can't get past this point, you know?

5328
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:11,320
Like with the, for example, David Enrich,

5329
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:17,640
we have so much more, oh, this would be something

5330
02:40:17,720 --> 02:40:19,560
maybe you could help me with.

5331
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:22,120
So many efforts and incriminates him

5332
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:24,520
with so many fucking terrible things that he's done

5333
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:25,920
and all the shit he's done for me.

5334
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:27,560
It was all in signal.

5335
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:30,120
And I took my phone to get the screen fix at the Apple Store

5336
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:32,920
and I said, whatever you do, do not reset the phone.

5337
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:35,680
And the fucking, the hacker has reset the phone.

5338
02:40:35,680 --> 02:40:36,760
And so I lost it all.

5339
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:38,440
But I think it's an iPhone's success,

5340
02:40:38,440 --> 02:40:40,240
so it's not irretrievable.

5341
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:42,400
It's still on the fucking phone.

5342
02:40:42,400 --> 02:40:44,320
But I cannot get the keys.

5343
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:45,600
I don't know how to get the fucking keys yet.

5344
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:48,400
It's been the slowest thing I've ever learned.

5345
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:50,960
But I've got the tar ball, I've extracted the messages,

5346
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:52,560
but I cannot get the fucking encryption keys

5347
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,320
because I can't find them on the phone.

5348
02:40:54,320 --> 02:40:55,480
That's where I'm stuck.

5349
02:40:55,480 --> 02:40:58,840
It's like, that was, well, Alconov.

5350
02:40:58,840 --> 02:41:01,960
iOS, Frenzik edition.

5351
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:06,960
iOS, Frenzik, it's just toolkits.

5352
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:11,200
iOS, Frenzik, toolkits, it's a quick thing to do.

5353
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:12,520
I mean, at least from my experience,

5354
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:17,320
Alconov isn't like a great novel with Frenzik utility.

5355
02:41:17,320 --> 02:41:20,440
Like, I've played around with it, but I didn't use it because,

5356
02:41:20,440 --> 02:41:22,320
like, they don't automatically decrypt stuff

5357
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:25,400
because, like, most normal Frenzik's programs do.

5358
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:26,240
Really?

5359
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:27,560
All right.

5360
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:29,720
I'll talk to you about the free one.

5361
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:30,560
Autopsy?

5362
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:31,400
Is it good?

5363
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:32,240
Autopsy's not bad.

5364
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:34,320
I mean, that's a free one that anyone can download, isn't it?

5365
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:35,560
It's a bunch of other ones that, I think,

5366
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:37,360
a better job than Alconov.

5367
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:38,360
Yeah.

5368
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:40,400
I just, well, it's because I spent the money.

5369
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:41,720
You know, it's having expenses,

5370
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:43,440
so I feel like I have to learn it.

5371
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:44,280
Yeah.

5372
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:48,960
I don't know.

5373
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:50,920
Another company that kind of delved into mobile,

5374
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:51,760
it does just my opinion.

5375
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:53,080
No, no, no, you're right.

5376
02:41:53,080 --> 02:41:57,280
They're really famous because of the thing with the photographs

5377
02:41:57,280 --> 02:41:58,480
in 2015, right?

5378
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:00,440
So, like, they're kind of, right in their hotel,

5379
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:02,280
now they have a mobile Frenzik thing that they're like,

5380
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:03,760
well, if we put this out and they trust their name,

5381
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:04,600
then we'll use it.

5382
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,800
But, just from my experience,

5383
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:07,200
I just haven't had much success with it.

5384
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:08,560
Did you try Axiom?

5385
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:09,400
I used Axiom.

5386
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:10,240
What do you think of that one?

5387
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:11,080
That's not bad.

5388
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:12,000
It's a lot of good functionality.

5389
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,520
Yeah, it's pretty strong.

5390
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:14,360
Yeah.

5391
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:15,520
It's very good.

5392
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:17,640
So then I figured out you can just get pre-trials,

5393
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:21,840
if you just say you're extending the pre-trials.

5394
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,680
But yeah.

5395
02:42:24,680 --> 02:42:29,680
So you think that Beth is, she actually is a NSA, CIA?

5396
02:42:30,280 --> 02:42:33,560
No, I think it's worse than full of shit, yeah.

5397
02:42:33,560 --> 02:42:36,040
But do you think that she's a hacker?

5398
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:36,880
I do.

5399
02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:38,360
I personally, I do think so.

5400
02:42:38,360 --> 02:42:40,320
I know no one else seems to be sure of my thing,

5401
02:42:40,320 --> 02:42:42,760
but I do think that she's a hacker.

5402
02:42:42,760 --> 02:42:46,520
I'm always trying to ask her to do it for some help,

5403
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:50,240
but she's the one that introduced me to Elkheimsoft.

5404
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:52,800
I said, I have this problem with the signal messages.

5405
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:53,640
What do you recommend?

5406
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:55,480
She said, Elkheimsoft, ILS, forensic.

5407
02:42:58,840 --> 02:43:00,200
What do you mean, Jimmy?

5408
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:02,040
I don't know.

5409
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:04,480
Again, again, right, it's too open-ended.

5410
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:06,400
And she texted me the other day.

5411
02:43:06,400 --> 02:43:09,640
She's like, if you've spoken to FBI,

5412
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:11,880
I said, no, I'm not speaking to FBI.

5413
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:14,040
She's like, well, are you sure?

5414
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:15,280
I was like, well, I'm not lying to you.

5415
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:17,880
I was talking to the FBI, like, you know,

5416
02:43:17,880 --> 02:43:20,360
I will let you know when I speak to FBI.

5417
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:24,480
So I go, well, you're kind of known as an FBI informant.

5418
02:43:24,480 --> 02:43:26,280
I said, well, fuck you, I'm not an informant.

5419
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:28,520
I'm a source, like, help the FBI.

5420
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:30,680
I do not inform anybody.

5421
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:32,400
And then she's like, well, it's kind of the same thing.

5422
02:43:32,400 --> 02:43:33,640
And then I had to go on an entire raid

5423
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:35,520
to explain how it's very different.

5424
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:38,640
So we'll let you know that she is probably,

5425
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:42,320
and also yesterday, one of my friends, Andrew,

5426
02:43:42,320 --> 02:43:44,280
had to defend me on this group as well,

5427
02:43:44,280 --> 02:43:47,480
because Xan was saying, your friend

5428
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:50,280
with a well-known FBI informant, which is me,

5429
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:52,080
which is another illusion to me.

5430
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,240
So it's Xan.

5431
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,480
Oh, Xan is telling you.

5432
02:43:56,480 --> 02:43:58,800
Xan's the partner of Emma.

5433
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:02,720
So she's saying to who that you're a friend of mine

5434
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:03,600
in our group.

5435
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:06,840
Oh, so your friend is, Xan is acting your friend

5436
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:07,880
for being friends with you?

5437
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:08,880
Yes.

5438
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:09,380
Oh, OK.

5439
02:44:09,380 --> 02:44:09,880
Sorry.

5440
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:12,360
Exactly.

5441
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:13,360
OK.

5442
02:44:13,360 --> 02:44:15,920
I mean, it's obviously a little different,

5443
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:18,080
and I don't know if you understand.

5444
02:44:18,080 --> 02:44:19,080
This is weird drama.

5445
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:23,080
It's like, yeah, there are many people with a group like that.

5446
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:25,560
I think this, you know, I'm like 96, I think.

5447
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:26,800
Oh, wow.

5448
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:29,080
That's why it's too many people.

5449
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:31,160
And there's too many lurkers, and there's too many new

5450
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,960
and fresh, like, mid-dag identity,

5451
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:36,040
so there's already a bunch of substratas,

5452
02:44:36,040 --> 02:44:38,720
and some groups are coming from that group.

5453
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:42,240
And what's funny is they're all, well, I mean,

5454
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:43,480
I'll tell you, it's not a big deal.

5455
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:46,240
It's with all Barrett's friends.

5456
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:48,520
Barrett's so, like, it's so weird.

5457
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:51,400
I don't know how he does it, but he's, you know.

5458
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:54,760
Because you might, of the 96, you might know how many people

5459
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:56,680
in real life are in that group.

5460
02:44:56,680 --> 02:44:58,440
Like, women in real life.

5461
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:01,040
Well, I guess, like, who they really are.

5462
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:02,880
Oh, I know about half of them.

5463
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:03,380
Yeah.

5464
02:45:03,380 --> 02:45:05,800
Like, into the other half, or like, lurker or something.

5465
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:10,480
Yeah, but we have people that try and check them out

5466
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:12,840
and figure out who these people are.

5467
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:14,560
Like, once in a while, you'll get it right,

5468
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:16,880
and we can serve it, you know, coming in there

5469
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:20,680
and trying to spout a bunch of crazy shit, and kick him out.

5470
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:23,040
And then, I noticed, someone loses a phone.

5471
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:24,720
Like, it happened recently, and then all of a sudden,

5472
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:28,160
we have to, it's been compromised, the FBI's in.

5473
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:29,880
I'm sure you, was that you?

5474
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:31,520
I don't know.

5475
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:31,960
Was it you?

5476
02:45:31,960 --> 02:45:32,680
Okay, somebody.

5477
02:45:32,680 --> 02:45:33,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

5478
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:35,560
I don't know, somebody.

5479
02:45:35,560 --> 02:45:41,680
Oh, and that, oh, shit, wait, I'm Junco.

5480
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:43,160
Did you call Barrett?

5481
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:45,640
I think he recorded a phone call with you.

5482
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:46,480
I hadn't called Barrett.

5483
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:47,320
You hadn't called Barrett?

5484
02:45:47,320 --> 02:45:52,560
There was a different FBI agent that was trying to,

5485
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:57,240
he was going to, I think it was some white racist,

5486
02:45:57,240 --> 02:45:59,560
nationalist fucking weird shit.

5487
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:02,280
And he was someone else who was working, white racist.

5488
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:05,160
Yeah, he used to know, but I remember the name

5489
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:07,240
of Junco actually rings a bell.

5490
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:09,200
And I was, I was going to tell you the other day,

5491
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,760
but I had to figure out what it was first.

5492
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:12,240
But now I just remembered again, I probably

5493
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:14,760
should not be talking right now and saying it out loud,

5494
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:17,420
but I am.

5495
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:23,080
But there is something, there is something,

5496
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:24,880
something secret.

5497
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:25,760
Secret is going to be right now.

5498
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:26,640
Okay?

5499
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:28,840
You don't know who the person is.

5500
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:29,800
Were you there?

5501
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:30,960
He's only, he's the one who realized?

5502
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:32,080
No.

5503
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:32,880
Does he know Barrett?

5504
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:34,400
Have you got him in question?

5505
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:37,000
I know, I know, I've never met a person.

5506
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,360
Oh, well, I mean, I have met, yes,

5507
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:41,320
there's a few people I know first,

5508
02:46:41,320 --> 02:46:44,400
but I can't, like my friends, I'm not gonna tell you, yeah.

5509
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:48,480
Getting a sense of the group, like, any other.

5510
02:46:48,480 --> 02:46:50,760
Let me show you, like, the most recent thing.

5511
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:53,440
Let's see.

5512
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:01,440
Ooh, someone's trying to,

5513
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:05,680
Hey, you guys, who's trying to hack me now?

5514
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:06,520
You got a thing?

5515
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:07,360
No.

5516
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:08,320
Don't click on the link.

5517
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:09,920
What was it? What did you get?

5518
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:11,200
No, I just got one of these things.

5519
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:12,880
I think it's my girlfriend.

5520
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:15,120
Who's using the other computer?

5521
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:16,160
Oh, he's.

5522
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:17,440
No, that's not what that says.

5523
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:18,280
That's my girlfriend.

5524
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:19,880
He's finding it really fucking awesome.

5525
02:47:19,880 --> 02:47:21,000
Yeah, I know.

5526
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:24,440
It's, like, it's funny enough, the other computer

5527
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:25,520
is Gwen Simpson's.

5528
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:27,600
What was that?

5529
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,600
Yeah, it was the Fusion GCat.

5530
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:31,800
The Steal Dacian.

5531
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:36,320
I mean, like, there's a lot of stuff

5532
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:37,160
that I probably shouldn't know,

5533
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:39,800
but I just don't, I mean, it's kind of like.

5534
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:41,320
You didn't follow the Steal Dacian?

5535
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:42,320
The whole Trump Russia?

5536
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:43,160
No, I didn't know about it,

5537
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:44,760
but, like, I didn't follow that much.

5538
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:46,800
Anyway, I said, I lived at his house for a while,

5539
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:48,400
at Gwen's house, yeah.

5540
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:49,560
And he didn't pay me half the money

5541
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:51,560
he was supposed to, so I took the computer.

5542
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:53,600
Wait, is that, yeah.

5543
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:59,800
Oh, and yeah, and there's a whole Russian spy thing

5544
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:01,120
going on, too.

5545
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:02,440
What's the Russian spy thing?

5546
02:48:04,280 --> 02:48:09,000
So there's, so I was telling Tim and Jami as well,

5547
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,840
but they're sort of, they're things, so I don't know.

5548
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:13,360
Am I supposed to mix things together?

5549
02:48:13,360 --> 02:48:16,120
But if Tim's aware of it, like, I would use the hot tin.

5550
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:17,120
Let me tell Tim first.

5551
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:17,960
Let me tell Tim first.

5552
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:18,800
Okay.

5553
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:20,560
Well, I should ask him if it's okay

5554
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:23,400
Yeah, I mean, if Tim already knows about it,

5555
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:25,960
he would, like, I don't worry that type of stuff either,

5556
02:48:25,960 --> 02:48:28,160
so, like, I would just tell someone else to.

5557
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:31,160
Yeah, would he, would he tell me the, uh,

5558
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:33,200
interior or the exterior?

5559
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:35,160
Like, like, what, the United States

5560
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:36,840
or outside of the United States?

5561
02:48:36,840 --> 02:48:39,160
Are we looking for a Russian hacker

5562
02:48:39,160 --> 02:48:41,560
or are we looking for a, everything?

5563
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:42,400
Yeah?

5564
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:44,640
Dude, that would be fun for me.

5565
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:45,680
I would like to catch people.

5566
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:47,840
I like, I can, I can do that.

5567
02:48:47,840 --> 02:48:49,840
But if money, the money is my specialty.

5568
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:52,920
That's what I'm, better than the hacker.

5569
02:48:56,680 --> 02:48:57,520
Cool.

5570
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:58,360
All right.

5571
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:00,760
Do you need to send someone for something?

5572
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:02,000
Oh, yeah, sorry.

5573
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,600
No, I just got, I need to eat something.

5574
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:05,440
My brain is...

5575
02:49:05,440 --> 02:49:06,720
You don't think you're gonna eat something?

5576
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:09,160
Yeah, could we take a cigarette break or something?

5577
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:10,120
Is it okay?

5578
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:10,960
Yeah.

5579
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:11,800
Yeah?

5580
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:14,640
All right, let's do it.

5581
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:16,480
What do you want?

5582
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:17,760
No, no, no, I just...

5583
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:19,280
Yeah, I want sandwiches, then.

5584
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:20,120
Really?

5585
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:20,960
Yeah.

5586
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:21,800
What kind of sandwich?

5587
02:49:21,800 --> 02:49:23,320
A sandwich or...

5588
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:24,160
Okay.

5589
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:26,160
Sure, well, yeah, I'd love one.

5590
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:29,360
Gratsen, that's nice.

5591
02:49:29,360 --> 02:49:31,520
I'll put on a mask or whatever.

5592
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:33,240
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

5593
02:49:35,720 --> 02:49:36,920
What was I gonna show you?

5594
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:39,600
At the time, you're...

5595
02:49:41,080 --> 02:49:44,560
Look, I don't know allegiance to these guys at all.

5596
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:47,520
I mean, they've just, they've become sort of friends, but,

5597
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:51,600
you know, as much as you can have a friend on that,

5598
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:56,840
that doesn't tell you anything about that, right?

5599
02:49:56,840 --> 02:49:59,520
It's just sort of fun, more fun sort of.

5600
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:03,120
Like, you're in the workplace,

5601
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:05,840
you're not friends with all your workers, right?

5602
02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:07,160
No, I don't feel right for now.

5603
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:11,480
Oh, yeah, I'll hit the head, you know where it is, right?

5604
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:12,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

5605
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:13,320
You guys are just gonna go...

5606
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:14,800
But I'll wait for you, because you can't fit out.

5607
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:15,640
Oh, that's right.

5608
02:50:18,520 --> 02:50:22,600
So what's your specialty?

5609
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:24,720
No, same, but I just happened to work in this office.

5610
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:25,560
In this office?

5611
02:50:25,560 --> 02:50:27,920
Right, so, if you say, like, laundry.

5612
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:28,760
Yeah?

5613
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:32,640
Of course, he, you know, he flew here to speak to you,

5614
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:36,200
so let him, let him, yeah, yeah, he flew here yesterday.

5615
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:37,120
I didn't know it was just for me,

5616
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:38,120
I just thought he was coming here

5617
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:39,240
and I wanted to speak to you while he was here.

5618
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:43,920
Yeah, so, for me, like, when you're in management,

5619
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:45,840
I'm like, oh, okay, like, a lot of these guys on the floor

5620
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:48,560
do, like, business email compromise, and a lot of guys,

5621
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:49,400
like...

5622
02:50:49,400 --> 02:50:50,240
Did you, what?

5623
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:51,240
I didn't hear you.

5624
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:52,480
Business email compromise?

5625
02:50:52,480 --> 02:50:53,320
Oh, really?

5626
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:54,840
Yeah, I don't know, okay.

5627
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:55,960
That's easy, yeah.

5628
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:59,120
Yeah, so, business email compromise, and then...

5629
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:00,080
Is that a term for it?

5630
02:51:00,080 --> 02:51:01,280
Just business email compromise?

5631
02:51:01,280 --> 02:51:02,440
There's a, I didn't know there was a term for it.

5632
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:03,880
Yeah, so a lot of things out of Nigeria,

5633
02:51:03,880 --> 02:51:05,200
and it's just funny, when you mentioned

5634
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:07,280
you're not lobbying, is there a thing like...

5635
02:51:08,360 --> 02:51:09,720
Yeah, one of our guys over here,

5636
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:13,120
they just got someone out of, like, Dubai,

5637
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:14,080
or something like that.

5638
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:14,920
Yeah, okay.

5639
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:15,880
Cool.

5640
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:19,200
And they're digging into that versus something like,

5641
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:21,520
they're special to you, like, laundering,

5642
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:22,600
laundering money, right?

5643
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:25,480
So, like, romance, victim, romance scam victims,

5644
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:26,560
like a victimized...

5645
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:28,480
Oh, yeah, I heard that.

5646
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:31,520
Eventually, he gets out to, like, Canada, China,

5647
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:32,640
or all these other countries,

5648
02:51:32,640 --> 02:51:34,840
and there's, like, a whole money mule network

5649
02:51:34,840 --> 02:51:36,240
that's, like, pretty tough to...

5650
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:37,080
Is it really?

5651
02:51:37,080 --> 02:51:37,920
Is it like a company?

5652
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:39,080
Is it one person behind it, or is it...

5653
02:51:39,080 --> 02:51:41,520
No, no, no, it's all a loose connection, yeah.

5654
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:42,360
Loose.

5655
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:43,200
Interesting.

5656
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:46,800
It's like a, like, a lead in welding connections

5657
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:50,960
sort of thing, like, there was a...

5658
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:52,960
Basically, like, very, very...

5659
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:54,200
And they all know each other in person,

5660
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:55,040
that's the difference.

5661
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:55,880
Oh, they do?

5662
02:51:55,880 --> 02:51:56,720
They know each other, it's like,

5663
02:51:56,720 --> 02:51:57,560
oh, you know this guy?

5664
02:51:57,560 --> 02:52:00,040
He's leading, interested in, you know,

5665
02:52:00,040 --> 02:52:03,080
doing some work, opening bank accounts, and stuff like that.

5666
02:52:03,080 --> 02:52:04,640
Ah, I understand that, yeah.

5667
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:07,440
So, like, they're friends in Nigeria?

5668
02:52:07,440 --> 02:52:09,440
Or in the community?

5669
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:11,440
Shit, you know we did?

5670
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:14,400
We had to, like, this lawyer was essentially an asshole.

5671
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:18,040
He said, we need your narrative to store ACP for Monday.

5672
02:52:18,040 --> 02:52:21,120
So, I went on the Fiverr, and I tried to find it.

5673
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:21,960
Oh, Fiverr.

5674
02:52:21,960 --> 02:52:24,120
It's a narrative of Marie's story.

5675
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:25,320
Fiverr.

5676
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:26,800
So, I went on Fiverr?

5677
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:27,640
Oh, sure.

5678
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:31,080
I went on Fiverr.

5679
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:31,920
Really?

5680
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:35,320
I found someone to do a live transcription

5681
02:52:35,320 --> 02:52:36,800
and it's a Nigerian guy.

5682
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:40,120
He wanted to be paid in Bitcoin yesterday or tomorrow.

5683
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:42,960
And Marie says, no, I'm not gonna pay you that.

5684
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:45,440
And then he says, okay, and that's it.

5685
02:52:45,440 --> 02:52:50,440
So, I'm thinking, well, he just got all of Marie's

5686
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:52,440
information since she was a child.

5687
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:55,440
So, he should probably pay the guy, right?

5688
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:57,280
It's a new scam, I think.

5689
02:52:57,280 --> 02:52:58,560
You're doing transcription services,

5690
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:01,360
get your private data, and then sell that data.

5691
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:02,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5692
02:53:02,960 --> 02:53:04,480
Nigerian's committing fraud.

5693
02:53:04,480 --> 02:53:05,320
What do you mean?

5694
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:10,080
Like crazy, you know, connoisseurs, yes.

5695
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:13,920
I mean, they're in that rush, they're doing good stuff.

5696
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:17,800
Why isn't that, why is that the hotbed here,

5697
02:53:17,800 --> 02:53:19,320
criminal activity?

5698
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:22,240
I don't know, it's what's called like training, you know?

5699
02:53:22,240 --> 02:53:23,080
Training stuff.

5700
02:53:23,080 --> 02:53:23,920
You're gonna wait here real quick?

5701
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:24,760
Okay.

5702
02:53:26,360 --> 02:53:28,320
You think they train each other and like,

5703
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:29,960
you know, it's like, hey, you know,

5704
02:53:29,960 --> 02:53:31,640
you grow up with all these people and like,

5705
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:33,840
hey, you want to make a cash and then they say,

5706
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:35,840
all you gotta do is you send out these emails,

5707
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:37,640
there's this script and whatever,

5708
02:53:37,640 --> 02:53:39,080
and then they teach other people.

5709
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:42,720
It's like any other criminal organization.

5710
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:44,240
That's the way it works, it's all good.

5711
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:46,000
Right now, I guess they're,

5712
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,120
I haven't been looking around right here,

5713
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:48,880
but they're like in protest right now?

5714
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:49,720
Oh, really?

5715
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:52,200
I don't see anything, so Pat's gonna cut it off.

5716
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:53,040
I'm gonna say there's no, like,

5717
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:54,800
see any signers or whatever.

5718
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:56,440
Yeah, that'd be bad.

5719
02:53:56,440 --> 02:53:57,280
Yeah, exactly.

5720
02:53:57,280 --> 02:53:58,280
Yeah, I don't know why that.

5721
02:53:58,280 --> 02:53:59,120
Yeah.

5722
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:02,640
Huh.

5723
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:03,840
Where are they protesting?

5724
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:06,440
There's the answer, you know?

5725
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:09,800
Don't join, pal.

5726
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:11,320
Don't do it, don't do it.

5727
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:14,800
You guys get a bad rap, you know?

5728
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:16,760
Like seriously, I was like everybody else

5729
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:18,520
until I met Tim and Jenny.

5730
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:19,360
Yeah.

5731
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:20,200
And then I was like, you know,

5732
02:54:20,200 --> 02:54:23,040
I can't believe I considered you guys people, guys.

5733
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:25,120
What are you doing here, dude?

5734
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:27,760
You just being careful on me, yeah.

5735
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:29,680
How'd you guys get started on this?

5736
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:31,920
I don't know, I just started a little while ago.

5737
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:33,440
I always wanted to do it as a kid.

5738
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:34,280
Yeah?

5739
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:35,520
Here I am, so I'm talking to Dad.

5740
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:36,840
Did you good do the whole training

5741
02:54:36,840 --> 02:54:38,840
and either you taught you everything now

5742
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:40,000
or did you know before?

5743
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Not much, not much.

5744
02:54:42,560 --> 02:54:44,360
Oh, for the computer stuff I went to,

5745
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:45,880
my degree is in there.

5746
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:46,720
Oh, it is?

5747
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:47,560
I don't know about that.

5748
02:54:47,560 --> 02:54:49,960
I'm like, oh no, but yeah,

5749
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:51,200
fan thing is I want to do it as a kid

5750
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:54,600
and then easily enough, you just apply online, everything.

5751
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:55,640
Yeah.

5752
02:54:55,640 --> 02:54:58,400
Yeah, so it's not like you know a guy or whatever.

5753
02:54:58,400 --> 02:54:59,760
No, that's cool, that's cool.

5754
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:00,600
Interesting.

5755
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:01,440
How lucky.

5756
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:03,000
That's good.

5757
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:03,960
Yeah, I'll give you a quick peep.

5758
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:06,080
This is what it's like, you can scroll around.

5759
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:08,720
It's not that, it's not a cool, great, crazy day

5760
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:11,080
that I keep, it's not what you think.

5761
02:55:11,080 --> 02:55:11,920
Cool.

5762
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:23,000
I'm not for rockin'.

5763
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:23,840
What's wrong?

5764
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:25,560
I'm not for rockin', it's business.

5765
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:27,600
I assume these are not like real people, right?

5766
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:28,920
No, they're not real people.

5767
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:31,480
I mean, they're not their real names.

5768
02:55:31,480 --> 02:55:34,480
Some of them, I mean, I use my real name.

5769
02:55:34,480 --> 02:55:35,480
That's your friend.

5770
02:55:35,560 --> 02:55:36,760
I use his real name.

5771
02:55:36,760 --> 02:55:37,600
Oh.

5772
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:39,360
I think Barry uses his real name.

5773
02:55:39,360 --> 02:55:42,240
Conlon, I don't know, kind of, Doc Rockett is a,

5774
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:44,840
I can't remember, I used to read through it again.

5775
02:55:44,840 --> 02:55:46,240
I used to know what everybody was, but.

5776
02:55:46,240 --> 02:55:47,920
He's too many secrets, you know?

5777
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:50,080
Oh, that guy's great, yeah, I do.

5778
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:51,760
Let me tell them.

5779
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:53,880
He doesn't do anything illegal.

5780
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:56,240
He's like, he's just like a researcher.

5781
02:55:56,240 --> 02:55:57,640
He's not even that good.

5782
02:55:57,640 --> 02:55:59,360
He's got a couple of databases in there.

5783
02:55:59,360 --> 02:56:01,240
He's just very loyal and helpful.

5784
02:56:01,240 --> 02:56:02,360
It's a little, yeah.

5785
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:03,880
So if anyone needs my help, I'll do that.

5786
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:05,520
Kind of nice thing.

5787
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:07,920
So there are no film crews outside,

5788
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:08,760
but you never know.

5789
02:56:08,760 --> 02:56:11,640
They could show up to your comfort level.

5790
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:12,480
Okay, let's go.

5791
02:56:12,480 --> 02:56:15,160
At the same time, the protest is like

5792
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:17,920
about salons wanting to open.

5793
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:19,040
That's what, salons?

5794
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:20,240
Yeah, like salons.

5795
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:21,560
Okay.

5796
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:22,400
Cool.

5797
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:23,240
Let's join.

5798
02:56:23,240 --> 02:56:24,240
A bit of a carry.

5799
02:56:24,240 --> 02:56:26,440
Oh, that's what we really did there.

5800
02:56:26,440 --> 02:56:27,760
Oh, thank you.

5801
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:30,040
That was pretty good, though.

5802
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:31,560
I mean, I give you credit.

5803
02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:38,080
God, it's split ends.

5804
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:39,400
Okay, there you go.

5805
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:44,440
So yeah, it's not that it's fun.

5806
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:46,920
It's mostly just people yelling.

5807
02:56:46,920 --> 02:56:49,040
During like, you know, Joe,

5808
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:50,520
I'm sure you know Joe Fiona.

5809
02:56:51,800 --> 02:56:53,080
Who's Joe Fiona?

5810
02:56:53,080 --> 02:56:55,040
Joe is like, what's his name?

5811
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:56,440
Sub-Zero?

5812
02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:57,360
Sub-Zero?

5813
02:56:57,360 --> 02:56:58,200
What's his name?

5814
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:00,040
I think in 2000.

5815
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:01,520
I'm talking about the moral product character.

5816
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:02,360
I don't know.

5817
02:57:02,360 --> 02:57:03,200
I don't know.

5818
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:04,040
It's his name.

5819
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:04,880
He's alias.

5820
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:07,480
He's pretty, he's a clever guy.

5821
02:57:07,480 --> 02:57:08,520
He was in the,

5822
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:09,720
did you see the Hacker War film?

5823
02:57:09,720 --> 02:57:12,040
That's the film that women did with Barrett.

5824
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:16,720
It's basically the guy that's talking all the time.

5825
02:57:16,720 --> 02:57:18,920
And wearing a suit, that guy.

5826
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:20,000
Okay.

5827
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,040
Joe, is he a hacker?

5828
02:57:22,040 --> 02:57:24,920
I think, yeah, he's like a, yeah.

5829
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:25,880
Okay.

5830
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:27,520
So he's like, he's friends with Barrett.

5831
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:28,920
Is that how he got in the group?

5832
02:57:28,920 --> 02:57:31,320
Yeah, these old friends of Barrett.

5833
02:57:31,320 --> 02:57:32,160
Cool.

5834
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:35,240
He's one of his old friends of Barrett, man.

5835
02:57:35,240 --> 02:57:36,960
So what did Joe do?

5836
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,280
Joe, I'm not quite sure.

5837
02:57:38,280 --> 02:57:40,360
I think he goes cycling a lot.

5838
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:43,880
He spends most of his time cycling

5839
02:57:43,880 --> 02:57:44,720
during the year.

5840
02:57:46,400 --> 02:57:47,600
He's a, everyone,

5841
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:49,880
but these guys are fairly optimistic, you know,

5842
02:57:49,880 --> 02:57:52,200
based, which is great and all.

5843
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:54,880
I'm not really a, you know,

5844
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:57,320
I mean, I guess I don't believe anything that strongly

5845
02:57:57,320 --> 02:57:59,080
to go out and carry a sign.

5846
02:57:59,080 --> 02:57:59,920
Sure.

5847
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:01,880
But I'm sure, you know,

5848
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:06,600
I mean, if someone DCFS right now,

5849
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:08,520
of course, I think I would probably carry a sign.

5850
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:11,000
So I'm like, it hasn't hit me personally yet.

5851
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:14,960
I mean, that's a really popular corner.

5852
02:58:14,960 --> 02:58:15,800
Yeah, wow.

5853
02:58:15,800 --> 02:58:17,040
Just because it's like one of the,

5854
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:17,880
you hear it over there.

5855
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:19,200
Yeah, this would be okay.

5856
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:21,960
It's really far away.

5857
02:58:30,920 --> 02:58:32,920
I can push a little bit over there.

5858
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:33,760
Sure.

5859
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:36,600
Oh, really?

5860
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:37,440
Oh, man.

5861
02:58:39,440 --> 02:58:42,400
So, yeah, I mean, just like everyone,

5862
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:43,520
the people who use their real names

5863
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:46,080
really aren't afraid of the guy finding out.

5864
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:48,120
So, I'm sure you, yeah.

5865
02:58:50,120 --> 02:58:53,600
But the, yeah, there was another interesting thing.

5866
02:58:55,160 --> 02:58:56,880
God, I can't remember why they say code.

5867
02:58:57,160 --> 02:58:59,000
I'm running to show you the thing.

5868
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:00,320
I can almost guarantee you.

5869
02:59:00,320 --> 02:59:02,840
It's not me, because I'm not that important.

5870
02:59:02,840 --> 02:59:04,800
No, but you were from Houston,

5871
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:06,800
and Barrett said it was a guy from Houston

5872
02:59:06,800 --> 02:59:08,680
that called a friend of his

5873
02:59:08,680 --> 02:59:10,720
that was trying to infiltrate some group,

5874
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:12,040
but he was on the wrong group.

5875
02:59:12,040 --> 02:59:14,040
I don't know exactly what happened.

5876
02:59:14,040 --> 02:59:15,200
We got a recording of the phone call.

5877
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:16,520
I wanted to play back the phone call

5878
02:59:16,520 --> 02:59:18,640
to see if that was you talking to this other guy.

5879
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:20,240
Not Barrett directly, but someone else.

5880
02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:22,040
I would be interested if you got a recording

5881
02:59:22,040 --> 02:59:23,400
of me talking to someone.

5882
02:59:23,400 --> 02:59:24,240
I love you.

5883
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:25,080
I love you.

5884
02:59:27,280 --> 02:59:29,280
Yeah, that's what I said with the code.

5885
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:32,880
Okay.

5886
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:40,640
Now, could you, is it possible that,

5887
02:59:41,640 --> 02:59:46,640
is it possible to have this guy,

5888
02:59:46,920 --> 02:59:48,080
that you've done your research,

5889
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:50,560
you probably understand that Steve is not a good guy?

5890
02:59:50,560 --> 02:59:51,400
He's Steve.

5891
02:59:51,400 --> 02:59:52,240
Steve Tolts?

5892
02:59:53,240 --> 02:59:55,080
You've posted here on Facebook.

5893
02:59:55,080 --> 02:59:58,880
Yeah, like he's not a stand-up guy.

5894
02:59:58,880 --> 02:59:59,720
He's not a,

5895
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:04,960
you know the type that's run to mom and the scribbling.

5896
03:00:04,960 --> 03:00:05,960
Yeah, not yet.

5897
03:00:08,480 --> 03:00:11,360
I think it's actually really become a threat

5898
03:00:11,360 --> 03:00:15,320
to not only tomorrow's update with the priest,

5899
03:00:15,320 --> 03:00:16,480
the priest that's happening.

5900
03:00:16,480 --> 03:00:17,480
Sure, no, I get it.

5901
03:00:18,760 --> 03:00:21,240
Is it possible to have him reported?

5902
03:00:22,240 --> 03:00:23,080
No.

5903
03:00:26,680 --> 03:00:27,520
Australia.

5904
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:34,680
I went to a whole moral crisis.

5905
03:00:35,880 --> 03:00:36,920
Did I do this or not?

5906
03:00:36,920 --> 03:00:39,400
And I asked them, they said they'd do it.

5907
03:00:39,400 --> 03:00:40,240
But then I said,

5908
03:00:40,240 --> 03:00:41,520
but then all of a sudden I had this father,

5909
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:43,080
I said, we're not going to do that tomorrow.

5910
03:00:43,080 --> 03:00:44,840
That was the bottom line.

5911
03:00:44,840 --> 03:00:46,000
But that was last year.

5912
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Yeah, that was last year.

5913
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,080
But now everyone's really asking me,

5914
03:00:50,200 --> 03:00:51,040
I know.

5915
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:53,360
Thank you.

5916
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:54,360
Thank you.

5917
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:56,360
Oh, good, good, good, good.

5918
03:01:00,360 --> 03:01:01,720
You're welcome.

5919
03:01:01,720 --> 03:01:02,720
I am the broker.

5920
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:04,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

5921
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:06,200
You actually thought about it.

5922
03:01:06,200 --> 03:01:08,640
I was like, I'm not fucking one out.

5923
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:09,920
I was like, you know,

5924
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:12,040
don't look at me, I did it on the right.

5925
03:01:12,040 --> 03:01:13,440
I did, I did it on the right.

5926
03:01:13,440 --> 03:01:14,440
That's all I got.

5927
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:17,440
It's a little bit economic.

5928
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:20,440
Because I was shopping in one town,

5929
03:01:20,440 --> 03:01:23,440
and this was like twice that.

5930
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:25,440
I'm like, if you guys really eat it,

5931
03:01:25,440 --> 03:01:26,440
I can eat for a week.

5932
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,440
That's true.

5933
03:01:34,440 --> 03:01:36,440
I don't think you guys realize how nice this weather is

5934
03:01:36,440 --> 03:01:38,440
for August, whatever.

5935
03:01:38,440 --> 03:01:40,440
Do you know Andrews?

5936
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:41,440
I don't like this weather.

5937
03:01:41,440 --> 03:01:43,440
Do you know Andrews?

5938
03:01:43,440 --> 03:01:44,440
Who's Andrew?

5939
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:46,440
The one you pointed out, my friend.

5940
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:47,440
Your friend?

5941
03:01:47,440 --> 03:01:48,440
Yeah.

5942
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:49,440
I mean, you just told me about him,

5943
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:50,440
but I don't know.

5944
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:52,440
Before I mentioned him.

5945
03:01:52,440 --> 03:01:54,440
He's a good, interesting character.

5946
03:01:54,440 --> 03:01:55,440
What's the deal?

5947
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:56,440
He's a really good guy.

5948
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:57,440
Good dude.

5949
03:01:58,440 --> 03:01:59,440
Do you remember, maybe,

5950
03:01:59,440 --> 03:02:03,440
probably in 2015 there was this article

5951
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:06,440
in Bloomberg about

5952
03:02:07,440 --> 03:02:08,440
if there was this company,

5953
03:02:08,440 --> 03:02:09,440
and it turned out later,

5954
03:02:09,440 --> 03:02:11,440
you find out articles later,

5955
03:02:11,440 --> 03:02:14,440
that it was a Russian company,

5956
03:02:14,440 --> 03:02:16,440
they created this big deficit for people.

5957
03:02:16,440 --> 03:02:17,440
Someone would call you and say,

5958
03:02:17,440 --> 03:02:19,440
you owe us $2,000 a month,

5959
03:02:19,440 --> 03:02:21,440
and then you say,

5960
03:02:21,440 --> 03:02:22,440
you got this thing,

5961
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:23,440
you forgot about it,

5962
03:02:23,440 --> 03:02:24,440
you should probably pay it.

5963
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,440
Most people will pay that money.

5964
03:02:26,440 --> 03:02:29,440
If you will just create this big debt,

5965
03:02:29,440 --> 03:02:31,440
and it's a really fucking dollar,

5966
03:02:31,440 --> 03:02:33,440
and it's $1,000,000 a month.

5967
03:02:33,440 --> 03:02:35,440
So a lot of people would take the manager,

5968
03:02:35,440 --> 03:02:36,440
and people would just be doing that.

5969
03:02:36,440 --> 03:02:38,440
And they'd try to get it to Andrews.

5970
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:39,440
They wouldn't call Andrew,

5971
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:41,440
and they'd say, you owe us $5,000,

5972
03:02:41,440 --> 03:02:42,440
we're a combination of debts,

5973
03:02:42,440 --> 03:02:43,440
and they'd say,

5974
03:02:43,440 --> 03:02:44,440
oh my god,

5975
03:02:44,440 --> 03:02:45,440
I remember paying that back,

5976
03:02:45,440 --> 03:02:47,440
they didn't really owe us.

5977
03:02:47,440 --> 03:02:49,440
So he starts fighting and arguing with this guy,

5978
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:51,440
until the guy threatens to go

5979
03:02:51,440 --> 03:02:53,440
and create this company.

5980
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:54,440
Like, totally possible,

5981
03:02:54,440 --> 03:02:55,440
and Andrew said,

5982
03:02:55,440 --> 03:02:56,440
that's it.

5983
03:02:56,440 --> 03:02:58,440
So he starts doing like,

5984
03:02:58,440 --> 03:02:59,440
he's now,

5985
03:02:59,440 --> 03:03:02,440
he's the Liam Neeson thing,

5986
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:04,440
I have three,

5987
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:05,440
you know,

5988
03:03:05,440 --> 03:03:07,440
a few good things,

5989
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:08,440
whatever the client is.

5990
03:03:08,440 --> 03:03:09,440
And that's pretty good.

5991
03:03:09,440 --> 03:03:10,440
So you reverse engineers,

5992
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:11,440
it's brilliant what he did,

5993
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:12,440
I love it.

5994
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:13,440
Reverse engineers,

5995
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:14,440
everyone that's called him,

5996
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:15,440
and looks him up,

5997
03:03:15,440 --> 03:03:16,440
there's all the background on them,

5998
03:03:16,440 --> 03:03:19,440
gets them to give up more information on their,

5999
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:21,440
just like you could do in any case.

6000
03:03:21,440 --> 03:03:22,440
You know,

6001
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:23,440
give information to the guy at mob,

6002
03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:24,440
and the hierarchy,

6003
03:03:24,440 --> 03:03:26,440
all the way up to Weldon,

6004
03:03:26,440 --> 03:03:27,440
the congressman,

6005
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:29,440
was he a senator or congressman?

6006
03:03:29,440 --> 03:03:31,440
Well, I'm a senator or something.

6007
03:03:31,440 --> 03:03:32,440
Is he Weldon?

6008
03:03:32,440 --> 03:03:33,440
No,

6009
03:03:33,440 --> 03:03:34,440
Josh Weldon,

6010
03:03:34,440 --> 03:03:36,440
or is he something Weldon?

6011
03:03:36,440 --> 03:03:37,440
Yeah, man,

6012
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:38,440
I don't know all the senators

6013
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:39,440
who represented him,

6014
03:03:39,440 --> 03:03:40,440
so I'm a bad,

6015
03:03:40,440 --> 03:03:41,440
he's an ex-servant.

6016
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:42,440
But,

6017
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:43,440
I mean,

6018
03:03:43,440 --> 03:03:44,440
he might be,

6019
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:45,440
he might be actually,

6020
03:03:45,440 --> 03:03:46,440
I know he's a congressman person,

6021
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:47,440
but that's about the ex-servant,

6022
03:03:47,440 --> 03:03:48,440
I know.

6023
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:49,440
Yeah,

6024
03:03:49,440 --> 03:03:50,440
but he's in bed with a lot of,

6025
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:51,440
the Russian companies,

6026
03:03:51,440 --> 03:03:53,440
they're creating these fake debt companies,

6027
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:55,440
and it's a really good story,

6028
03:03:55,440 --> 03:03:56,440
it's great articles,

6029
03:03:56,440 --> 03:03:57,440
and it's just sort of reverse engineers,

6030
03:03:57,440 --> 03:03:58,440
put some in jail,

6031
03:03:58,440 --> 03:04:00,440
and it's a good guy at the store.

6032
03:04:00,440 --> 03:04:01,440
It's very impressed.

6033
03:04:01,440 --> 03:04:02,440
That's cool.

6034
03:04:02,440 --> 03:04:03,440
I mean,

6035
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:04,440
he found me,

6036
03:04:04,440 --> 03:04:05,440
he just wanted to know

6037
03:04:05,440 --> 03:04:06,440
if I had any data

6038
03:04:06,440 --> 03:04:07,440
on those people as well,

6039
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:08,440
like,

6040
03:04:08,440 --> 03:04:09,440
I was looking for Weldon,

6041
03:04:09,440 --> 03:04:10,440
the Russians,

6042
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:11,440
the Tudmento,

6043
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:13,440
or some other guy,

6044
03:04:13,440 --> 03:04:15,440
and that's how we became friends.

6045
03:04:15,440 --> 03:04:16,440
He's a good guy.

6046
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:17,440
That's cool.

6047
03:04:17,440 --> 03:04:19,440
I thought he was already working with you guys.

6048
03:04:19,440 --> 03:04:20,440
I'm pretty sure he was,

6049
03:04:20,440 --> 03:04:21,440
I thought he was CIA.

6050
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:22,440
Okay,

6051
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:23,440
I mean,

6052
03:04:23,440 --> 03:04:24,440
so if he was CIA then,

6053
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:25,440
I don't think he would.

6054
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:26,440
That's what I thought.

6055
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:27,440
I don't know.

6056
03:04:27,440 --> 03:04:28,440
Have you ever been in the,

6057
03:04:28,440 --> 03:04:29,440
like,

6058
03:04:29,440 --> 03:04:30,440
okay.

6059
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:31,440
Yeah,

6060
03:04:31,440 --> 03:04:32,440
he came out to visit.

6061
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:33,440
I don't know,

6062
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:35,440
do you think he'd want to work with us?

6063
03:04:35,440 --> 03:04:36,440
I think he would.

6064
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:37,440
I think he would,

6065
03:04:37,440 --> 03:04:38,440
actually.

6066
03:04:38,440 --> 03:04:40,440
Do you want to give me his contact information?

6067
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:42,440
I think I'd have to ask him.

6068
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:43,440
Okay.

6069
03:04:43,440 --> 03:04:44,440
And then,

6070
03:04:44,440 --> 03:04:45,440
if he'd never have to,

6071
03:04:45,440 --> 03:04:46,440
I'd bring it up.

6072
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:47,440
Because I don't know,

6073
03:04:47,440 --> 03:04:48,440
he's like a,

6074
03:04:48,440 --> 03:04:49,440
like a really,

6075
03:04:49,440 --> 03:04:52,440
he almost pisses me off,

6076
03:04:52,440 --> 03:04:53,440
he's like,

6077
03:04:53,440 --> 03:04:54,440
too good.

6078
03:04:54,440 --> 03:04:55,440
He's like,

6079
03:04:55,440 --> 03:04:57,440
he reminds me of my father in the sense

6080
03:04:57,440 --> 03:04:58,440
of his morality.

6081
03:04:58,440 --> 03:04:59,440
He's very,

6082
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:00,440
very strong.

6083
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:01,440
That's good.

6084
03:05:01,440 --> 03:05:02,440
So that's the thing you guys like,

6085
03:05:02,440 --> 03:05:03,440
I mean,

6086
03:05:03,440 --> 03:05:04,440
you hire a lot of,

6087
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:05,440
like,

6088
03:05:05,440 --> 03:05:06,440
Mormons, right?

6089
03:05:06,440 --> 03:05:07,440
So,

6090
03:05:07,440 --> 03:05:08,440
who's at the CIA?

6091
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:10,440
Who's hiring all the Mormons?

6092
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:12,440
They're doing a lot of good things.

6093
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:13,440
Yeah, okay.

6094
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:14,440
If they can pass the broadcast,

6095
03:05:14,440 --> 03:05:15,440
yeah.

6096
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:16,440
Okay,

6097
03:05:16,440 --> 03:05:17,440
really the Mormons

6098
03:05:17,440 --> 03:05:18,440
can't pass the broadcast?

6099
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:19,440
That's great.

6100
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:20,440
Because they can't.

6101
03:05:20,440 --> 03:05:21,440
They cannot.

6102
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:22,440
No, they can't.

6103
03:05:22,440 --> 03:05:23,440
Oh, they can't,

6104
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:24,440
right?

6105
03:05:24,440 --> 03:05:25,440
Yeah.

6106
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:26,440
Okay,

6107
03:05:26,440 --> 03:05:27,440
okay.

6108
03:05:27,440 --> 03:05:28,440
I mean,

6109
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:29,440
the Mormons

6110
03:05:29,440 --> 03:05:30,440
a lot of time,

6111
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:31,440
they do missions.

6112
03:05:31,440 --> 03:05:32,440
So when they go overseas,

6113
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:33,440
they learn the language,

6114
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:34,440
it's probably useful

6115
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:35,440
for like,

6116
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:36,440
CIA and all that kind of stuff.

6117
03:05:36,440 --> 03:05:37,440
Right,

6118
03:05:37,440 --> 03:05:38,440
good cover.

6119
03:05:38,440 --> 03:05:39,440
Yeah.

6120
03:05:39,440 --> 03:05:40,440
Yeah,

6121
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:41,440
but it's so,

6122
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:42,440
like,

6123
03:05:42,440 --> 03:05:43,440
we're so

6124
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:44,440
strict with rules

6125
03:05:44,440 --> 03:05:45,440
and stuff.

6126
03:05:45,440 --> 03:05:46,440
How do you,

6127
03:05:46,440 --> 03:05:47,440
how do you,

6128
03:05:47,440 --> 03:05:48,440
justify one thing

6129
03:05:48,440 --> 03:05:49,440
or do something else?

6130
03:05:49,440 --> 03:05:50,440
That's a good question.

6131
03:05:50,440 --> 03:05:51,440
That's something

6132
03:05:51,440 --> 03:05:52,440
I've,

6133
03:05:52,440 --> 03:05:53,440
know nothing about.

6134
03:05:53,440 --> 03:05:54,440
Right.

6135
03:05:54,440 --> 03:05:55,440
Well,

6136
03:05:55,440 --> 03:05:56,440
being a Mormon

6137
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:57,440
won't work for the agency.

6138
03:05:57,440 --> 03:05:58,440
Like,

6139
03:05:58,440 --> 03:05:59,440
how do you justify,

6140
03:05:59,440 --> 03:06:00,440
like,

6141
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:01,440
a man,

6142
03:06:01,440 --> 03:06:02,440
a woman,

6143
03:06:02,440 --> 03:06:03,440
a man,

6144
03:06:03,440 --> 03:06:04,440
a man,

6145
03:06:04,440 --> 03:06:05,440
a man,

6146
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:06,440
a man,

6147
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:07,440
a man,

6148
03:06:07,440 --> 03:06:08,440
a man,

6149
03:06:08,440 --> 03:06:09,440
a man,

6150
03:06:09,440 --> 03:06:10,440
a man,

6151
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:11,440
a man,

6152
03:06:11,440 --> 03:06:12,440
a man,

6153
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:13,440
a man.

6154
03:06:13,440 --> 03:06:14,440
What do you guys

6155
03:06:14,440 --> 03:06:15,440
do?

6156
03:06:15,440 --> 03:06:16,440
Jesus,

6157
03:06:16,440 --> 03:06:17,440
people?

6158
03:06:17,440 --> 03:06:18,440
Can't see that.

6159
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:19,440
Okay.

6160
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:20,440
Do it or not do it?

6161
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:21,440
No.

6162
03:06:21,440 --> 03:06:22,440
I wish there was.

6163
03:06:22,440 --> 03:06:23,440
Yeah,

6164
03:06:23,440 --> 03:06:24,440
I wish there was.

6165
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:25,440
Yeah,

6166
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:26,440
I wish there was.

6167
03:06:26,440 --> 03:06:27,440
Yeah,

6168
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:28,440
I wish there was.

6169
03:06:28,440 --> 03:06:34,440
That's what's more impressive, what you need for me right away is the thing that you have on your plate.

6170
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:40,440
What I can help you with, what you can do with the transactional for Marlowe's safety.

6171
03:06:40,440 --> 03:06:44,440
I would like to bro it, Steve.

6172
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:46,440
Listen to me, sir.

6173
03:06:46,440 --> 03:06:48,440
Thank you.

6174
03:06:54,440 --> 03:06:56,440
Seriously, it caught me up.

6175
03:06:56,440 --> 03:06:58,440
Are you happy?

6176
03:06:58,440 --> 03:07:00,440
Maybe.

6177
03:07:00,440 --> 03:07:02,440
You've got to take off that pavilion.

6178
03:07:02,440 --> 03:07:04,440
Thank you.

6179
03:07:04,440 --> 03:07:06,440
Thank you very much.

6180
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:08,440
You're welcome.

6181
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:10,440
I like the economy with our mayor.

6182
03:07:10,440 --> 03:07:12,440
That's right.

6183
03:07:12,440 --> 03:07:16,440
I'm going to watch out for the mayor.

6184
03:07:26,440 --> 03:07:34,440
I would have to be really secretive if I now tell the mayor.

6185
03:07:34,440 --> 03:07:36,440
I can't tell her everything.

6186
03:07:36,440 --> 03:07:40,440
What I don't tell her, she always finds out.

6187
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:42,440
What would you tell her?

6188
03:07:42,440 --> 03:07:48,440
I'm going to tell her, oh they offered me a job.

6189
03:07:48,440 --> 03:07:52,440
I'd be like, what are they paying down?

6190
03:07:52,440 --> 03:07:54,440
Not money.

6191
03:07:54,440 --> 03:07:56,440
It's a good job.

6192
03:07:56,440 --> 03:07:58,440
But they will have Marlowe.

6193
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:00,440
They should say, trust them.

6194
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:02,440
You can live with them.

6195
03:08:02,440 --> 03:08:04,440
See that?

6196
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:06,440
You're the mayor.

6197
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:08,440
I know.

6198
03:08:08,440 --> 03:08:10,440
Me?

6199
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:12,440
She isn't a super.

6200
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:14,440
She'll see you working on it.

6201
03:08:14,440 --> 03:08:16,440
What are you doing?

6202
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:18,440
Okay, thanks.

6203
03:08:18,440 --> 03:08:20,440
I'll see you later.

6204
03:08:24,440 --> 03:08:28,440
It's fun to do an episode 7.

6205
03:08:28,440 --> 03:08:32,440
But I don't know how people will know.

6206
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:34,440
I figured it was okay to do an episode 7 today.

6207
03:08:34,440 --> 03:08:36,440
It was a bit rainy.

6208
03:08:36,440 --> 03:08:38,440
But she said it was not.

6209
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:40,440
It was a lot.

6210
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:44,440
A lot of stuff was in French.

6211
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:48,440
Which brings me to a good point.

6212
03:08:48,440 --> 03:08:50,440
So I was afraid to look at it.

6213
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:52,440
I don't understand what it meant.

6214
03:08:52,440 --> 03:08:54,440
Just to take a look at it.

6215
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:56,440
I'm a hard guy, right?

6216
03:08:56,440 --> 03:09:00,440
That's concerning.

6217
03:09:00,440 --> 03:09:02,440
So that's why I just ran it over.

6218
03:09:02,440 --> 03:09:04,440
I'll forward it to you.

6219
03:09:04,440 --> 03:09:06,440
That's what I said to David.

6220
03:09:06,440 --> 03:09:08,440
I don't know.

6221
03:09:08,440 --> 03:09:10,440
I would really like to use that against him somehow.

6222
03:09:10,440 --> 03:09:12,440
I'm trying to do that.

6223
03:09:12,440 --> 03:09:14,440
It's legal for me to give him that.

6224
03:09:14,440 --> 03:09:16,440
But he does it with an afterward.

6225
03:09:16,440 --> 03:09:18,440
I don't know.

6226
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:20,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

6227
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:22,440
It's hard.

6228
03:09:22,440 --> 03:09:24,440
It's hard to say.

6229
03:09:24,440 --> 03:09:26,440
It's hard to say.

6230
03:09:26,440 --> 03:09:28,440
But it's definitely hard to do what he did.

6231
03:09:32,440 --> 03:09:34,440
So before the show, what's up with you?

6232
03:09:34,440 --> 03:09:36,440
You know?

6233
03:09:36,440 --> 03:09:38,440
You know what's really wrong?

6234
03:09:38,440 --> 03:09:40,440
You know?

6235
03:09:40,440 --> 03:09:42,440
I'm just a musician.

6236
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:44,440
I used to play football and having...

6237
03:09:44,440 --> 03:09:46,440
Sorry, I didn't go to it.

6238
03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:48,440
I see.

6239
03:09:48,440 --> 03:09:52,440
And there was a guy who lived about me in London.

6240
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:54,440
He lived in London for you.

6241
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:56,440
He was really good at acting, with the transition.

6242
03:09:56,440 --> 03:09:58,440
He gave me a list of all that.

6243
03:09:58,440 --> 03:10:00,440
He addresses me.

6244
03:10:00,440 --> 03:10:02,440
He'd be a good guy.

6245
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:04,440
He'd just have fun and see me.

6246
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:06,440
You could tell that or something.

6247
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:08,440
And he's the one who said,

6248
03:10:08,440 --> 03:10:10,440
I don't think it's going to be that bad.

6249
03:10:10,440 --> 03:10:12,440
And at times it's like $30.

6250
03:10:12,440 --> 03:10:14,440
I mean, I don't think it's going to be that bad.

6251
03:10:14,440 --> 03:10:18,440
I want to spend $30 on some bullshit.

6252
03:10:18,440 --> 03:10:20,440
I would have bought pizza.

6253
03:10:20,440 --> 03:10:22,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6254
03:10:24,440 --> 03:10:26,440
Well, that was about the sound of it,

6255
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:28,440
but I mean, I was really focused.

6256
03:10:28,440 --> 03:10:30,440
I have 36 hours to do the single.

6257
03:10:30,440 --> 03:10:32,440
It's been all my time.

6258
03:10:32,440 --> 03:10:34,440
A lot of work.

6259
03:10:34,440 --> 03:10:36,440
A lot of work.

6260
03:10:36,440 --> 03:10:38,440
You know, I don't do that anymore.

6261
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:40,440
Really?

6262
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:42,440
Do you miss it?

6263
03:10:42,440 --> 03:10:44,440
I mean, I miss lifestyle.

6264
03:10:46,440 --> 03:10:48,440
No.

6265
03:10:48,440 --> 03:10:50,440
I don't.

6266
03:10:50,440 --> 03:10:52,440
I don't have music,

6267
03:10:52,440 --> 03:10:54,440
but I think I do.

6268
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:56,440
I don't.

6269
03:10:56,440 --> 03:10:58,440
Cross our lifestyle.

6270
03:10:58,440 --> 03:11:00,440
Yeah, but you got to stop at some points.

6271
03:11:00,440 --> 03:11:02,440
You can't be the other guy doing that.

6272
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:04,440
Yeah, there's a lot of things.

6273
03:11:04,440 --> 03:11:06,440
It's not like it's still going on.

6274
03:11:06,440 --> 03:11:08,440
Yeah, but still, it's a little creepy.

6275
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:10,440
We were at a party.

6276
03:11:10,440 --> 03:11:12,440
We didn't see what's happening.

6277
03:11:12,440 --> 03:11:14,440
What's the name of the meeting?

6278
03:11:14,440 --> 03:11:16,440
I didn't talk to him.

6279
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:18,440
I was like, what's the change that you're doing here?

6280
03:11:18,440 --> 03:11:20,440
You just get out of rehab.

6281
03:11:20,440 --> 03:11:22,440
That's where he's supposed to not do it.

6282
03:11:22,440 --> 03:11:24,440
He's like, let's go get a drink.

6283
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:26,440
And whatever.

6284
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:28,440
It's all like rehab.

6285
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:30,440
Things are supposed to not do it.

6286
03:11:30,440 --> 03:11:32,440
So, you guys,

6287
03:11:32,440 --> 03:11:34,440
we're having everything.

6288
03:11:34,440 --> 03:11:36,440
We got the idea.

6289
03:11:38,440 --> 03:11:40,440
There's a lot of rules.

6290
03:11:40,440 --> 03:11:42,440
We're not supposed to be that broad.

6291
03:11:42,440 --> 03:11:44,440
But first you're out.

6292
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:46,440
You got laid and be manipulative.

6293
03:11:46,440 --> 03:11:48,440
Because we don't have your drugs here.

6294
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:50,440
You're trying to compensate.

6295
03:11:50,440 --> 03:11:52,440
I don't know.

6296
03:11:52,440 --> 03:11:54,440
We'll never realize that.

6297
03:11:54,440 --> 03:11:58,440
So you're not allowed to date at all after rehab?

6298
03:11:58,440 --> 03:12:00,440
No.

6299
03:12:00,440 --> 03:12:02,440
So, you're on a graduation?

6300
03:12:02,440 --> 03:12:04,440
You'll get that certain tone of the dopey

6301
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:06,440
that you don't have for your drug.

6302
03:12:06,440 --> 03:12:08,440
So, the relationship won't fill it up for you.

6303
03:12:08,440 --> 03:12:10,440
But you're always going to end tragically

6304
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:12,440
because once you're speaking away.

6305
03:12:12,440 --> 03:12:14,440
It's like what you're going to do.

6306
03:12:14,440 --> 03:12:16,440
I'm going to act strong.

6307
03:12:16,440 --> 03:12:18,440
I'm going to act strong.

6308
03:12:18,440 --> 03:12:20,440
That's what I'm going to do.

6309
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:22,440
We'll just talk about that.

6310
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:24,440
You don't want to do it?

6311
03:12:24,440 --> 03:12:26,440
No.

6312
03:12:26,440 --> 03:12:28,440
It depends.

6313
03:12:28,440 --> 03:12:30,440
You want to or you want to.

6314
03:12:30,440 --> 03:12:32,440
If you just don't want to.

6315
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:34,440
If you're stuck with it.

6316
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:36,440
You have to.

6317
03:12:36,440 --> 03:12:38,440
I mean, I did.

6318
03:12:38,440 --> 03:12:40,440
Well, first of all, Muzza,

6319
03:12:40,440 --> 03:12:42,440
he's called Nick.

6320
03:12:42,440 --> 03:12:44,440
We need you to stay at this rehab

6321
03:12:44,440 --> 03:12:46,440
but we figure out everything

6322
03:12:46,440 --> 03:12:48,440
through your mopsie.

6323
03:12:48,440 --> 03:12:50,440
If you don't know anything about Muzza

6324
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:52,440
or if you don't know anything about Muzza

6325
03:12:52,440 --> 03:12:54,440
you might want to stay out here.

6326
03:12:54,440 --> 03:12:56,440
I was banned from the UK for three years.

6327
03:12:56,440 --> 03:12:58,440
I've never stayed with him.

6328
03:12:58,440 --> 03:13:00,440
Nothing's relationship.

6329
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:02,440
So, stay the year in the California

6330
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:04,440
in this rehab.

6331
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:06,440
We'll figure out the next move.

6332
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:08,440
And that's when I realized

6333
03:13:08,440 --> 03:13:10,440
that I had to learn really fast

6334
03:13:10,440 --> 03:13:12,440
for my mother.

6335
03:13:12,440 --> 03:13:14,440
Well, the Buddha taught me.

6336
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:16,440
She got my dad.

6337
03:13:16,440 --> 03:13:18,440
She threw out my dad.

6338
03:13:18,440 --> 03:13:20,440
Not the people, literally.

6339
03:13:20,440 --> 03:13:22,440
But he signed it.

6340
03:13:22,440 --> 03:13:24,440
But in the New York state

6341
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:26,440
he agreed.

6342
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:28,440
So, it's not up to her to throw that.

6343
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:30,440
So, she landed in the fall of 2004

6344
03:13:30,440 --> 03:13:32,440
where she gets everything.

6345
03:13:32,440 --> 03:13:34,440
She's very smart.

6346
03:13:34,440 --> 03:13:36,440
And I didn't know anything about finance.

6347
03:13:36,440 --> 03:13:38,440
But she's doing something that's happening

6348
03:13:38,440 --> 03:13:40,440
where you can learn fast.

6349
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:42,440
So, that's why I learned finance.

6350
03:13:44,440 --> 03:13:46,440
When you're desperate

6351
03:13:46,440 --> 03:13:48,440
and you have to face off

6352
03:13:48,440 --> 03:13:50,440
and get nothing to lose

6353
03:13:50,440 --> 03:13:52,440
you find like you have intelligence

6354
03:13:52,440 --> 03:13:54,440
and everything.

6355
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:56,440
Really, everyone has it.

6356
03:13:56,440 --> 03:13:58,440
I think it's the current everybody.

6357
03:13:58,440 --> 03:14:00,440
If you can get rid of the emotion

6358
03:14:00,440 --> 03:14:02,440
because emotion sort of clogs you up

6359
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:04,440
then you can get more free

6360
03:14:04,440 --> 03:14:06,440
and free of focus.

6361
03:14:06,440 --> 03:14:08,440
It's emotion that really blocks the emotions.

6362
03:14:08,440 --> 03:14:10,440
And emotion is important of course

6363
03:14:10,440 --> 03:14:12,440
but you also need the emotion to

6364
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:14,440
connect with someone to understand

6365
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:16,440
all the time.

6366
03:14:16,440 --> 03:14:18,440
You need to control it.

6367
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:20,440
It's the greatest freedom.

6368
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:24,440
Well, drugs.

6369
03:14:24,440 --> 03:14:26,440
Drugs help a lot.

6370
03:14:26,440 --> 03:14:28,440
When they train you, you can do it without drugs.

6371
03:14:28,440 --> 03:14:30,440
But at first, no, you can't.

6372
03:14:30,440 --> 03:14:32,440
But you're such an emotional mess.

6373
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:34,440
So, you take the drug

6374
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:36,440
which calms you down and makes you feel

6375
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:38,440
like it's making you focus.

6376
03:14:38,440 --> 03:14:40,440
Like I was not crying.

6377
03:14:40,440 --> 03:14:42,440
I was not keeping my father.

6378
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:44,440
And it's a reminder that

6379
03:14:44,440 --> 03:14:46,440
that part exists.

6380
03:14:46,440 --> 03:14:48,440
It's when you're pressing that existing

6381
03:14:48,440 --> 03:14:50,440
to get it back.

6382
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:52,440
So, you just mind yourself that,

6383
03:14:52,440 --> 03:14:54,440
yeah, I was free one day.

6384
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:56,440
So, you have it.

6385
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:58,440
So,

6386
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:00,440
you can then exchange it.

6387
03:15:00,440 --> 03:15:02,440
And you can actually say,

6388
03:15:02,440 --> 03:15:04,440
wait, is that

6389
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:06,440
is that my thinking?

6390
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:08,440
Is this you?

6391
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:10,440
Is that my question for you?

6392
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:12,440
Is this certain?

6393
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:14,440
That's the purpose of this.

6394
03:15:14,440 --> 03:15:16,440
Help me if you can hear me.

6395
03:15:16,440 --> 03:15:18,440
So, if you can stop me,

6396
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:20,440
stop me, stop me.

6397
03:15:20,440 --> 03:15:22,440
We do it with light speakers.

6398
03:15:22,440 --> 03:15:24,440
We have it.

6399
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:26,440
We get it.

6400
03:15:26,440 --> 03:15:28,440
It's like it becomes instinctive.

6401
03:15:28,440 --> 03:15:30,440
My dad would stop me.

6402
03:15:30,440 --> 03:15:32,440
He's the one.

6403
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:34,440
You guys never

6404
03:15:34,440 --> 03:15:36,440
trust your feelings.

6405
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:38,440
Always trust your instincts.

6406
03:15:38,440 --> 03:15:40,440
Your emotions.

6407
03:15:40,440 --> 03:15:42,440
And there's a huge difference between

6408
03:15:42,440 --> 03:15:44,440
your feelings and your emotions

6409
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:46,440
and your instincts.

6410
03:15:58,440 --> 03:16:00,440
What are you talking about?

6411
03:16:00,440 --> 03:16:02,440
Feelings versus questions.

6412
03:16:02,440 --> 03:16:04,440
Your instinct, I guess.

6413
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:06,440
Your instinct is my emotion.

6414
03:16:06,440 --> 03:16:08,440
Your instinct is my reply.

6415
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:10,440
It's like this danger is not in me.

6416
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:12,440
This is going to serve me, not serve me.

6417
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:14,440
I'm going to have to calculate it.

6418
03:16:14,440 --> 03:16:16,440
That's the risk.

6419
03:16:16,440 --> 03:16:18,440
I'm going to do the risk.

6420
03:16:18,440 --> 03:16:20,440
Let's see how sad it's going to be.

6421
03:16:20,440 --> 03:16:22,440
That's a year.

6422
03:16:22,440 --> 03:16:24,440
Our brains are so fucking

6423
03:16:24,440 --> 03:16:26,440
amazingly fast.

6424
03:16:26,440 --> 03:16:28,440
We calculate that.

6425
03:16:28,440 --> 03:16:30,440
And it comes out as an instinctive

6426
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:32,440
instinctive man.

6427
03:16:32,440 --> 03:16:34,440
The emotion of the cloud,

6428
03:16:34,440 --> 03:16:36,440
you can see everything through this wall

6429
03:16:36,440 --> 03:16:38,440
that you're not wanted or not loved

6430
03:16:38,440 --> 03:16:40,440
or you're not wanted or not loved.

6431
03:16:40,440 --> 03:16:42,440
That's the way you're going to friend the world.

6432
03:16:42,440 --> 03:16:44,440
That's the emotion you want to love.

6433
03:16:44,440 --> 03:16:46,440
So focus on the world.

6434
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:48,440
That's all they want.

6435
03:16:48,440 --> 03:16:50,440
You can do that.

6436
03:16:50,440 --> 03:16:52,440
Your dad just died.

6437
03:16:52,440 --> 03:16:54,440
My dad and my mother.

6438
03:16:54,440 --> 03:16:56,440
It was terrible.

6439
03:16:56,440 --> 03:16:58,440
I used to be

6440
03:16:58,440 --> 03:17:00,440
like a...

6441
03:17:00,440 --> 03:17:02,440
This is a country.

6442
03:17:02,440 --> 03:17:04,440
I didn't do that.

6443
03:17:04,440 --> 03:17:06,440
I didn't do shopping.

6444
03:17:06,440 --> 03:17:08,440
People did it for me.

6445
03:17:08,440 --> 03:17:10,440
All of a sudden, I'm looking at my car.

6446
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:12,440
I don't know how to do it.

6447
03:17:12,440 --> 03:17:14,440
I don't know how to...

6448
03:17:14,440 --> 03:17:16,440
I didn't think I had it in me.

6449
03:17:16,440 --> 03:17:18,440
They did.

6450
03:17:18,440 --> 03:17:20,440
I don't know. We'll see.

6451
03:17:20,440 --> 03:17:22,440
We'll see.

6452
03:17:22,440 --> 03:17:24,440
It's another thing I'm not going to go there.

6453
03:17:26,440 --> 03:17:28,440
It's a party.

6454
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:34,440
Hello.

6455
03:17:34,440 --> 03:17:36,440
How are you?

6456
03:17:36,440 --> 03:17:38,440
I'm fine.

6457
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:40,440
It's been a few years.

6458
03:17:40,440 --> 03:17:42,440
Did you sacrifice?

6459
03:17:42,440 --> 03:17:44,440
No.

6460
03:17:44,440 --> 03:17:46,440
It's been a few years.

6461
03:17:46,440 --> 03:17:48,440
Not as good as this guy's.

6462
03:17:48,440 --> 03:17:50,440
Thanks a lot.

6463
03:17:50,440 --> 03:17:52,440
What did you do for a while?

6464
03:17:52,440 --> 03:17:54,440
For a while.

6465
03:17:54,440 --> 03:17:56,440
For a while?

6466
03:17:56,440 --> 03:17:58,440
Really?

6467
03:17:58,440 --> 03:18:00,440
For a while.

6468
03:18:00,440 --> 03:18:02,440
I was doing a different one.

6469
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:04,440
We'll see.

6470
03:18:04,440 --> 03:18:06,440
We will do the same thing.

6471
03:18:06,440 --> 03:18:08,440
We will...

6472
03:18:08,440 --> 03:18:10,440
We'll do some research.

6473
03:18:10,440 --> 03:18:12,440
Development drugs.

6474
03:18:12,440 --> 03:18:14,440
Like...

6475
03:18:14,440 --> 03:18:16,440
We'll see.

6476
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:18,440
Yes, yes.

6477
03:18:18,440 --> 03:18:20,440
I didn't do it.

6478
03:18:20,440 --> 03:18:22,440
Oh, it didn't happen.

6479
03:18:22,440 --> 03:18:24,440
Yep. We didn't all...

6480
03:18:24,440 --> 03:18:26,440
Be born in a...

6481
03:18:26,440 --> 03:18:28,440
Sorry, we weren't born in a...

6482
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:30,440
We didn't all sort out...

6483
03:18:30,440 --> 03:18:32,440
You would do a different type of drug.

6484
03:18:32,440 --> 03:18:34,440
You would do a different type of drug.

6485
03:18:34,440 --> 03:18:36,440
You would do a different type of drug.

6486
03:18:36,440 --> 03:18:38,440
That's good.

6487
03:18:38,440 --> 03:18:40,440
That's good.

6488
03:18:40,440 --> 03:18:42,440
No, no.

6489
03:18:42,440 --> 03:18:44,440
It's kind of like using drugs.

6490
03:18:44,440 --> 03:18:46,440
That would be huge investments.

6491
03:18:46,440 --> 03:18:48,440
They are going to offer you that.

6492
03:18:48,440 --> 03:18:50,440
No, not anyone would.

6493
03:18:50,440 --> 03:18:52,440
That's like...

6494
03:18:52,440 --> 03:18:54,440
There's been a handle.

6495
03:18:54,440 --> 03:18:56,440
There's been a handle.

6496
03:18:56,440 --> 03:18:58,440
We have the FBI tries to fire

6497
03:18:58,440 --> 03:19:00,440
diversely

6498
03:19:00,440 --> 03:19:02,440
in terms of like backgrounds.

6499
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:04,440
So we don't...

6500
03:19:04,440 --> 03:19:06,440
We try it.

6501
03:19:06,440 --> 03:19:08,440
There's a big pool of like...

6502
03:19:08,440 --> 03:19:10,440
I want to join...

6503
03:19:10,440 --> 03:19:12,440
I want to join...

6504
03:19:12,440 --> 03:19:14,440
I want to be in contact with...

6505
03:19:14,440 --> 03:19:16,440
I want to join...

6506
03:19:16,440 --> 03:19:18,440
The military.

6507
03:19:18,440 --> 03:19:20,440
We certainly don't want to be a

6508
03:19:20,440 --> 03:19:22,440
100% of that.

6509
03:19:22,440 --> 03:19:24,440
We don't want to be a general...

6510
03:19:24,440 --> 03:19:26,440
We don't want to be a general population.

6511
03:19:26,440 --> 03:19:28,440
We don't want...

6512
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:30,440
We're going to get a fifth grade teacher

6513
03:19:30,440 --> 03:19:32,440
when I was in high school.

6514
03:19:32,440 --> 03:19:34,440
He also had a rocket scientist.

6515
03:19:34,440 --> 03:19:36,440
Just a lot of people.

6516
03:19:36,440 --> 03:19:38,440
I've had all over the world.

6517
03:19:38,440 --> 03:19:40,440
What was a fifth grade teacher.

6518
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:42,440
They've heard of people together?

6519
03:19:42,440 --> 03:19:44,440
She's actually a good...

6520
03:19:44,440 --> 03:19:46,440
She's still a good agent.

6521
03:19:46,440 --> 03:19:48,440
She must be a people person.

6522
03:19:48,440 --> 03:19:50,440
She's very good people.

6523
03:19:50,440 --> 03:19:52,440
But she's also a very good...

6524
03:19:52,440 --> 03:19:54,720
and a lot of things that we had to do.

6525
03:19:54,720 --> 03:19:55,720
But...

6526
03:19:55,720 --> 03:19:57,280
You still have the Casanovas?

6527
03:19:57,280 --> 03:19:58,480
And it still exists?

6528
03:19:58,480 --> 03:19:59,480
Casanovas?

6529
03:19:59,480 --> 03:20:00,480
Is it Mars?

6530
03:20:00,480 --> 03:20:01,480
What's that?

6531
03:20:01,480 --> 03:20:02,480
Casanovas.

6532
03:20:02,480 --> 03:20:03,480
It's Mars.

6533
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:06,480
Yeah, well, we don't know a lot like that.

6534
03:20:06,480 --> 03:20:07,480
It's a little thing.

6535
03:20:07,480 --> 03:20:09,480
No, it's like the old 60s.

6536
03:20:09,480 --> 03:20:12,480
You know, the guys who played, you get information.

6537
03:20:12,480 --> 03:20:13,480
Hello.

6538
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:15,480
I don't think that's it.

6539
03:20:15,480 --> 03:20:16,480
No, I don't.

6540
03:20:16,480 --> 03:20:18,480
Maybe it's what's waiting for my time.

6541
03:20:18,480 --> 03:20:19,480
That's the 60s.

6542
03:20:19,480 --> 03:20:21,480
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the...

6543
03:20:21,520 --> 03:20:23,520
You know, that's the limit.

6544
03:20:23,520 --> 03:20:25,520
They're working for us right now.

6545
03:20:25,520 --> 03:20:27,520
You guys get fired.

6546
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:29,520
That's the same.

6547
03:20:29,520 --> 03:20:31,520
Do you know how many roles we have?

6548
03:20:31,520 --> 03:20:34,520
Like, half the stories of your complete bullshit.

6549
03:20:34,520 --> 03:20:37,520
But, you know, it's good that there's a myth out there

6550
03:20:37,520 --> 03:20:40,520
that people make you just sleep with whoever.

6551
03:20:40,520 --> 03:20:42,520
Maybe that's...I'm sure that's what some agents said.

6552
03:20:42,520 --> 03:20:43,520
It's like, no, no, no.

6553
03:20:43,520 --> 03:20:45,520
I'm recruiting you for some super secret mission.

6554
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:47,520
All you gotta do is sleep with me.

6555
03:20:47,520 --> 03:20:48,520
Right.

6556
03:20:48,560 --> 03:20:50,560
You know, she's probably graduating.

6557
03:20:50,560 --> 03:20:52,560
It's like, I'm working for the FBI.

6558
03:20:52,560 --> 03:20:54,560
That's what I'm doing.

6559
03:20:54,560 --> 03:20:56,560
Oh, the good question, though.

6560
03:20:56,560 --> 03:21:00,560
You guys have unfettered access to, like,

6561
03:21:00,560 --> 03:21:05,560
the sort of the interagency software

6562
03:21:05,560 --> 03:21:08,560
where, like, if I wanted to go hack into your phone,

6563
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:12,560
I would do it with a new camera.

6564
03:21:12,560 --> 03:21:14,560
Is there a reason why?

6565
03:21:14,560 --> 03:21:16,560
Still, there's not a reason why.

6566
03:21:16,600 --> 03:21:19,600
But there's a powerful cause to be able to use it.

6567
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:23,600
Like, if I wanted to hack into your phone

6568
03:21:23,600 --> 03:21:27,600
and try your camera, would I need a passport?

6569
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:28,600
Yeah.

6570
03:21:28,600 --> 03:21:31,600
Or is it, like, is it sure like now?

6571
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:32,600
Is it in the world?

6572
03:21:32,600 --> 03:21:34,600
See, ten years ago, if you needed a passport,

6573
03:21:34,600 --> 03:21:35,600
it would be very qualified to get one.

6574
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:38,600
But now it's adjacent to the point where you just ask for it.

6575
03:21:38,600 --> 03:21:39,600
No, it's way harder.

6576
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:40,600
Really?

6577
03:21:40,600 --> 03:21:41,600
Should that, even that?

6578
03:21:41,600 --> 03:21:44,600
And just thinking theoretically is, like,

6579
03:21:44,640 --> 03:21:45,640
even harder to do.

6580
03:21:45,640 --> 03:21:46,640
Really?

6581
03:21:46,640 --> 03:21:48,640
Yeah, to an effect.

6582
03:21:48,640 --> 03:21:51,640
You're not, you're no longer searching, you're actively

6583
03:21:51,640 --> 03:21:53,640
buttering or flipping.

6584
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:55,640
That's what happens.

6585
03:21:55,640 --> 03:21:58,640
Yeah, then that, like, a new turn.

6586
03:21:58,640 --> 03:22:00,640
Like, a turn on the camera.

6587
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:02,640
What's the difference now in a guy sitting in a car

6588
03:22:02,640 --> 03:22:04,640
on top of a car?

6589
03:22:04,640 --> 03:22:07,640
Look, this thing can go places for some guy in a car here.

6590
03:22:07,640 --> 03:22:08,640
Which is...

6591
03:22:08,640 --> 03:22:09,640
In a car?

6592
03:22:09,640 --> 03:22:10,640
In a car.

6593
03:22:10,640 --> 03:22:11,640
In a car in your house.

6594
03:22:11,640 --> 03:22:13,640
Who's a guy in a car?

6595
03:22:13,680 --> 03:22:15,680
Yeah, I thought it was you guys.

6596
03:22:15,680 --> 03:22:16,680
See you guys?

6597
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:18,680
We're in the triangle.

6598
03:22:18,680 --> 03:22:20,680
I don't think so.

6599
03:22:20,680 --> 03:22:22,680
There's some other interesting things to see.

6600
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:25,680
You got a guy outside of the brewery.

6601
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:28,680
So he's in the same place with the triangle.

6602
03:22:28,680 --> 03:22:31,680
And then every time he spots, I mean, it's a wave.

6603
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:33,680
I thought it was you.

6604
03:22:33,680 --> 03:22:35,680
Might be, like, see a higher-department investigator

6605
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:37,680
for all I know.

6606
03:22:37,680 --> 03:22:38,680
Maybe that, too.

6607
03:22:38,680 --> 03:22:40,680
Let's take a picture of the place.

6608
03:22:40,680 --> 03:22:42,680
Can I just run it here?

6609
03:22:42,720 --> 03:22:43,720
How would you run it?

6610
03:22:43,720 --> 03:22:45,720
Oh, I got some.

6611
03:22:45,720 --> 03:22:47,720
You got a guy.

6612
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:49,720
That's the thing.

6613
03:22:49,720 --> 03:22:51,720
I got a guy.

6614
03:22:51,720 --> 03:22:53,720
You used to be seen in the improviser

6615
03:22:53,720 --> 03:22:55,720
and you guys know how to do it.

6616
03:22:55,720 --> 03:22:57,720
Oh, I know.

6617
03:22:57,720 --> 03:22:59,720
That is...

6618
03:22:59,720 --> 03:23:01,720
How do you put that?

6619
03:23:01,720 --> 03:23:02,720
Stuff.

6620
03:23:02,720 --> 03:23:04,720
I mean, you can't do it by yourself.

6621
03:23:04,720 --> 03:23:06,720
The level of this is not as much as it needs to be

6622
03:23:06,720 --> 03:23:09,720
to roll with the times and adapt.

6623
03:23:09,760 --> 03:23:11,760
Like, for example,

6624
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:14,760
this whole encryption key battle,

6625
03:23:14,760 --> 03:23:18,760
like, you know, we've had previous leaders talk about,

6626
03:23:18,760 --> 03:23:21,760
like, what do you need to give up the encryption key?

6627
03:23:21,760 --> 03:23:23,760
But we all kind of know, like,

6628
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:25,760
philosophically, that'll never,

6629
03:23:25,760 --> 03:23:27,760
and that shouldn't happen if it doesn't matter.

6630
03:23:27,760 --> 03:23:29,760
It's, like, a losing battle.

6631
03:23:29,760 --> 03:23:31,760
We're just going to, unfortunately, have to adapt.

6632
03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:34,760
If you just build a job, it's just going to be harder.

6633
03:23:34,760 --> 03:23:37,760
And then many, you know, like,

6634
03:23:37,800 --> 03:23:41,800
these old-school techniques

6635
03:23:41,800 --> 03:23:43,800
that, like, talking to people, like,

6636
03:23:43,800 --> 03:23:45,800
we're talking right now are talking to people

6637
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:47,800
that are now way more, you know,

6638
03:23:47,800 --> 03:23:49,800
just sitting at your desk

6639
03:23:49,800 --> 03:23:51,800
and looking at, like, a pipeline.

6640
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:54,800
So it becomes, there's a question figure

6641
03:23:54,800 --> 03:23:56,800
at work sometimes.

6642
03:23:56,800 --> 03:23:58,800
And, like, swaying back tomorrow.

6643
03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:01,800
And this is just me, but it should be hard.

6644
03:24:01,800 --> 03:24:03,800
It should be hard?

6645
03:24:03,800 --> 03:24:05,800
It should be hard.

6646
03:24:05,840 --> 03:24:07,840
It should be hard.

6647
03:24:07,840 --> 03:24:09,840
I agree a lot.

6648
03:24:09,840 --> 03:24:11,840
It should be better.

6649
03:24:11,840 --> 03:24:13,840
It's not the way it works.

6650
03:24:13,840 --> 03:24:15,840
It's the way it works.

6651
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:17,840
There's nothing, there's no secret to it.

6652
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:19,840
It's just that, you know,

6653
03:24:19,840 --> 03:24:21,840
I can find it when I want it,

6654
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:23,840
but I don't really want it yet.

6655
03:24:23,840 --> 03:24:25,840
There's nothing I can do.

6656
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:27,840
You can do that.

6657
03:24:27,840 --> 03:24:29,840
You know, I mean, I can do it.

6658
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:31,840
I can do it anywhere in the world.

6659
03:24:31,840 --> 03:24:33,840
You know, once you get there,

6660
03:24:33,880 --> 03:24:35,880
you have to actually keep a secret from all of them.

6661
03:24:35,880 --> 03:24:37,880
That's a weird quote.

6662
03:24:37,880 --> 03:24:39,880
I don't know what to make of it.

6663
03:24:39,880 --> 03:24:41,880
You just have to adapt to it and accept it, I guess.

6664
03:24:41,880 --> 03:24:43,880
It's true.

6665
03:24:43,880 --> 03:24:45,880
It's just, like, you know,

6666
03:24:45,880 --> 03:24:47,880
good pre-LLCs instead of work.

6667
03:24:49,880 --> 03:24:51,880
You don't have your name on it.

6668
03:24:51,880 --> 03:24:53,880
That's beautiful things.

6669
03:24:53,880 --> 03:24:55,880
That's why it's a living dog.

6670
03:24:55,880 --> 03:24:57,880
You can have a fake name.

6671
03:24:57,880 --> 03:24:59,880
You can have a name.

6672
03:24:59,880 --> 03:25:01,880
Perfectly legal.

6673
03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:03,920
It's a good thing to do.

6674
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:05,920
Jersey and all of Iowa.

6675
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:07,920
Yeah, it's just like a state.

6676
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:09,920
It's a state.

6677
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:11,920
You know what?

6678
03:25:11,920 --> 03:25:13,920
It's very deep, very Jersey.

6679
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:15,920
I think that's pretty sure.

6680
03:25:15,920 --> 03:25:17,920
Probably.

6681
03:25:17,920 --> 03:25:19,920
It's a good spot.

6682
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:25,920
Thank you.

6683
03:25:25,920 --> 03:25:27,920
You want to go?

6684
03:25:27,920 --> 03:25:29,920
I'll go.

6685
03:25:29,960 --> 03:25:31,960
I'm trying to be right there.

6686
03:25:31,960 --> 03:25:33,960
Yeah.

6687
03:25:35,960 --> 03:25:37,960
Actually, I think if you prefer

6688
03:25:37,960 --> 03:25:39,960
an opera or a movie,

6689
03:25:39,960 --> 03:25:41,960
I think you can take it.

6690
03:25:41,960 --> 03:25:43,960
I think you can take it.

6691
03:25:43,960 --> 03:25:45,960
I really do.

6692
03:25:45,960 --> 03:25:47,960
No, I don't.

6693
03:25:47,960 --> 03:25:49,960
I think you can take it.

6694
03:25:49,960 --> 03:25:51,960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

6695
03:25:51,960 --> 03:25:53,960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

6696
03:25:53,960 --> 03:25:55,960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

6697
03:25:55,960 --> 03:25:57,960
You can go to a movie.

6698
03:25:57,960 --> 03:25:59,960
You know what?

6699
03:25:59,960 --> 03:26:01,960
You have to do it.

6700
03:26:01,960 --> 03:26:03,960
You have to do it right.

6701
03:26:03,960 --> 03:26:05,960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

6702
03:26:05,960 --> 03:26:07,960
You can do it right.

6703
03:26:07,960 --> 03:26:09,960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

6704
03:26:09,960 --> 03:26:11,960
You can do it.

6705
03:26:11,960 --> 03:26:13,960
You can do it.

6706
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:16,960
You know what?

6707
03:26:16,960 --> 03:26:18,960
You can do it.

6708
03:26:18,960 --> 03:26:20,960
Okay.

6709
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:22,960
I'm not sure.

6710
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:24,960
I mean, I can't worry.

6711
03:26:24,960 --> 03:26:26,960
You can do it.

6712
03:26:26,960 --> 03:26:28,960
That's the thing I learned.

6713
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:33,960
It's not, I can't, it's, it's all I'm learning.

6714
03:26:33,960 --> 03:26:35,960
It's not only me.

6715
03:26:35,960 --> 03:26:37,960
It's only freedom, too.

6716
03:26:37,960 --> 03:26:39,960
It's a freedom, you know what I'm saying?

6717
03:26:39,960 --> 03:26:42,960
It's worrying about a kid, and then everything is justified.

6718
03:26:42,960 --> 03:26:45,960
Everything is justified if it's for his safety.

6719
03:26:45,960 --> 03:26:47,960
You know?

6720
03:26:47,960 --> 03:26:50,960
That's the interesting part of it.

6721
03:26:50,960 --> 03:26:53,960
Where are you thinking about yourself all the time?

6722
03:26:53,960 --> 03:26:55,960
I don't know.

6723
03:26:55,960 --> 03:26:58,960
I think it's more because of the protector.

6724
03:26:58,960 --> 03:27:02,960
Yeah, or, uh, or...

6725
03:27:02,960 --> 03:27:04,960
I don't know.

6726
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:06,960
There's a word for it.

6727
03:27:06,960 --> 03:27:08,960
You're a protector of someone.

6728
03:27:08,960 --> 03:27:10,960
Someone else's life is now.

6729
03:27:10,960 --> 03:27:12,960
Yeah.

6730
03:27:12,960 --> 03:27:14,960
Well, it's also pretty scary as shit.

6731
03:27:14,960 --> 03:27:17,960
You know, you're accountable for everything.

6732
03:27:18,960 --> 03:27:21,960
What if it turns out to be an accident?

6733
03:27:21,960 --> 03:27:23,960
Shit.

6734
03:27:23,960 --> 03:27:25,960
That's when you were like, that was the other person.

6735
03:27:25,960 --> 03:27:27,960
Shit.

6736
03:27:29,960 --> 03:27:31,960
Yeah, you're gonna have faith, though.

6737
03:27:31,960 --> 03:27:33,960
That's all for me.

6738
03:27:33,960 --> 03:27:35,960
Here you go.

6739
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:42,960
Are you serious?

6740
03:27:42,960 --> 03:27:44,960
He's just searing in the sun.

6741
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:46,960
Well, he's in his heart, right?

6742
03:27:46,960 --> 03:27:48,960
Yeah.

6743
03:27:52,960 --> 03:27:55,960
There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.

6744
03:27:55,960 --> 03:27:57,960
What's that?

6745
03:27:57,960 --> 03:27:59,960
There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.

6746
03:27:59,960 --> 03:28:01,960
And a trade-off and a trade-off.

6747
03:28:01,960 --> 03:28:03,960
It's really big.

6748
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:05,960
The whole concept of oil contracts is really big.

6749
03:28:05,960 --> 03:28:07,960
Yeah.

6750
03:28:07,960 --> 03:28:09,960
The oil companies are very political.

6751
03:28:09,960 --> 03:28:12,960
There's a lot of other factors that you can think of.

6752
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:14,960
Yeah?

6753
03:28:14,960 --> 03:28:16,960
Just political factors?

6754
03:28:16,960 --> 03:28:18,960
People that are just fucking...

6755
03:28:18,960 --> 03:28:20,960
I think everyone else is off.

6756
03:28:20,960 --> 03:28:22,960
Well, I think there's a lot of other things.

6757
03:28:22,960 --> 03:28:24,960
Peaks down around the whole...

6758
03:28:24,960 --> 03:28:26,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6759
03:28:26,960 --> 03:28:28,960
I don't know.

6760
03:28:28,960 --> 03:28:30,960
People have issues with oil contracts.

6761
03:28:30,960 --> 03:28:32,960
How do you think it's going to work?

6762
03:28:32,960 --> 03:28:34,960
How do you think it's going to work?

6763
03:28:34,960 --> 03:28:36,960

03:29:56,960 --> 03:29:58,960
How do you think it's gonna work?

6804
03:29:58,960 --> 03:30:00,960
Where positive positive 230 are set

6805
03:30:00,960 --> 03:30:02,960
where positive and positive C.

6806
03:30:02,960 --> 03:30:04,960
What are the odds,

6807
03:30:04,960 --> 03:30:06,960
What is theculрей to choose

6808
03:30:36,960 --> 03:30:38,960
Why do we need to do that?

6809
03:30:38,960 --> 03:30:41,960
Because we don't need to pay the money out.

6810
03:30:41,960 --> 03:30:43,960
It's different.

6811
03:30:43,960 --> 03:30:45,960
It's different.

6812
03:30:45,960 --> 03:30:46,960
It's different.

6813
03:30:46,960 --> 03:30:47,960
It's different.

6814
03:30:47,960 --> 03:30:48,960
It's different.

6815
03:30:48,960 --> 03:30:49,960
It's different.

6816
03:30:49,960 --> 03:30:50,960
It's different.

6817
03:30:50,960 --> 03:30:51,960
It's different.

6818
03:30:51,960 --> 03:30:52,960
It's different.

6819
03:30:52,960 --> 03:30:53,960
It's different.

6820
03:30:53,960 --> 03:30:54,960
It's different.

6821
03:30:54,960 --> 03:30:55,960
It's different.

6822
03:30:55,960 --> 03:30:56,960
It's different.

6823
03:30:56,960 --> 03:30:57,960
It's different.

6824
03:30:57,960 --> 03:30:58,960
It's different.

6825
03:30:58,960 --> 03:30:59,960
It's different.

6826
03:30:59,960 --> 03:31:00,960
It's different.

6827
03:31:00,960 --> 03:31:01,960
It's different.

6828
03:31:01,960 --> 03:31:02,960
It's different.

6829
03:31:02,960 --> 03:31:03,960
It's different.

6830
03:31:03,960 --> 03:31:04,960
It's different.

6831
03:31:04,960 --> 03:31:05,960
It's different.

6832
03:31:05,960 --> 03:31:06,960
It's different.

6833
03:31:06,960 --> 03:31:07,960
It is different.

6834
03:31:07,960 --> 03:31:08,960
It's different.

6835
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:09,960
It's different.

6836
03:31:09,960 --> 03:31:10,960
It is different.

6837
03:31:10,960 --> 03:31:11,960
It's different.

6838
03:31:11,960 --> 03:31:12,960
It's different.

6839
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:13,960
You have to carry it on your knee alone.

6840
03:31:13,960 --> 03:31:14,960
It's different.

6841
03:31:14,960 --> 03:31:15,960
It doesn't.

6842
03:31:15,960 --> 03:31:16,960
Yes.

6843
03:31:16,960 --> 03:31:27,460
It won't

6844
03:31:27,460 --> 03:31:28,460
It won't be big.

6845
03:31:28,460 --> 03:31:33,460
It can stand too low.

6846
03:31:33,460 --> 03:31:38,460
But it didn't end, obviously, I mean, it still worked.

6847
03:31:38,460 --> 03:31:41,460
Yeah, that's right, right now, but like, in a, oh.

6848
03:31:41,460 --> 03:31:42,460
Now it's 11.5.

6849
03:31:42,460 --> 03:31:43,460
11.5?

6850
03:31:43,460 --> 03:31:44,460
Yeah.

6851
03:31:44,460 --> 03:31:45,460
Okay.

6852
03:31:45,460 --> 03:31:46,460
I'm sorry.

6853
03:31:46,460 --> 03:31:47,460
I'm sorry.

6854
03:31:47,460 --> 03:31:48,460
It dropped to...

6855
03:31:48,460 --> 03:31:49,460
It went up to 12,000.

6856
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:50,460
It dropped to...

6857
03:31:50,460 --> 03:31:51,460
Yeah.

6858
03:31:51,460 --> 03:31:52,460
4,000.

6859
03:31:52,460 --> 03:31:55,460
At least then I could regulate it.

6860
03:31:55,460 --> 03:31:56,460
Do you like it?

6861
03:31:56,460 --> 03:31:57,460
At least a lot?

6862
03:31:57,460 --> 03:31:59,460
Well, yeah, I don't like it.

6863
03:31:59,460 --> 03:32:02,460
I just like to talk to you regularly.

6864
03:32:02,460 --> 03:32:07,460
Yeah, I still haven't tried it, you know.

6865
03:32:07,460 --> 03:32:11,460
I didn't expect you to do this, but you did.

6866
03:32:11,460 --> 03:32:16,460
You didn't have to decide what you wanted to try.

6867
03:32:16,460 --> 03:32:17,460
You just didn't know.

6868
03:32:17,460 --> 03:32:24,460
You didn't even know how to do it.

6869
03:32:24,460 --> 03:32:25,460
You just flashed in there.

6870
03:32:25,460 --> 03:32:27,460
You could be just pumping down.

6871
03:32:27,460 --> 03:32:28,460
Yeah.

6872
03:32:28,460 --> 03:32:33,460
I didn't want to say too much.

6873
03:32:33,460 --> 03:32:37,460
The whole Brickel-Prinsky arena.

6874
03:32:37,460 --> 03:32:38,460
I don't know.

6875
03:32:38,460 --> 03:32:45,460
I don't think you should say too much.

6876
03:32:45,460 --> 03:32:46,460
You're the last one.

6877
03:32:46,460 --> 03:32:48,460
You're the last one.

6878
03:32:48,460 --> 03:32:49,460
No, I'm the last one.

6879
03:32:49,460 --> 03:32:50,460
I'm the last one.

6880
03:32:50,460 --> 03:32:51,460
I'm the last one.

6881
03:32:51,460 --> 03:32:52,460
I'm the last one.

6882
03:32:52,460 --> 03:32:53,460
No, I'm the last one.

6883
03:32:53,460 --> 03:32:54,460
I'm the last one.

6884
03:32:54,460 --> 03:32:55,460
I'm the last one.

6885
03:32:55,460 --> 03:32:56,460
I'm the last one.

6886
03:32:56,460 --> 03:32:57,460
I'm the last one.

6887
03:32:57,460 --> 03:32:58,460
I'm the last one.

6888
03:32:58,460 --> 03:32:59,460
I'm the last one.

6889
03:32:59,460 --> 03:33:00,460
I'm the last one.

6890
03:33:00,460 --> 03:33:01,460
I'm the last one.

6891
03:33:01,460 --> 03:33:02,460
I'm the last one.

6892
03:33:02,460 --> 03:33:03,460
I'm the last one.

6893
03:33:03,460 --> 03:33:04,460
I'm the last one.

6894
03:33:04,460 --> 03:33:05,460
I'm the last one.

6895
03:33:05,460 --> 03:33:06,460
I'm the last one.

6896
03:33:06,460 --> 03:33:07,460
I'm the last one.

6897
03:33:07,460 --> 03:33:08,460
I'm the last one.

6898
03:33:08,460 --> 03:33:09,460
I'm the last one.

6899
03:33:09,460 --> 03:33:10,460
I'm the last one.

6900
03:33:10,460 --> 03:33:11,460
I'm the last one.

6901
03:33:11,460 --> 03:33:12,460
I'm the last one.

6902
03:33:12,460 --> 03:33:13,460
I'm the last one.

6903
03:33:13,460 --> 03:33:14,460
I'm the last one.

6904
03:33:14,460 --> 03:33:15,460
I'm the last one.

6905
03:33:15,460 --> 03:33:16,460
I'm the last one.

6906
03:33:16,460 --> 03:33:17,460
I'm the last one.

6907
03:33:17,460 --> 03:33:18,460
I'm the last one.

6908
03:33:18,460 --> 03:33:19,460
I'm the last one.

6909
03:33:19,460 --> 03:33:20,460
I'm the last one.

6910
03:33:20,460 --> 03:33:21,460
I'm the last one.

6911
03:33:21,460 --> 03:33:22,460
I'm the last one.

6912
03:33:22,460 --> 03:33:23,460
I'm the last one.

6913
03:33:23,460 --> 03:33:24,460
I'm the last one.

6914
03:33:24,460 --> 03:33:25,460
I'm the last one.

6915
03:33:25,460 --> 03:33:28,460
I'm the most iconic person in the room.

6916
03:33:28,460 --> 03:33:30,460
I'm the last one.

6917
03:33:30,460 --> 03:33:32,460
I'm the last one.

6918
03:33:32,460 --> 03:33:33,460
I'm the last one.

6919
03:33:33,460 --> 03:33:35,460
I'm the last one.

6920
03:33:35,460 --> 03:33:36,460
I'm the last one.

6921
03:33:36,460 --> 03:33:37,460
I'm the last one.

6922
03:33:37,460 --> 03:33:38,460
I'm the last one.

6923
03:33:38,460 --> 03:33:39,460
I'm the last one.

6924
03:33:39,460 --> 03:33:41,460
I'm the last one.

6925
03:33:41,460 --> 03:33:42,460
I'm the last one.

6926
03:33:42,460 --> 03:33:43,460
I'm the last one.

6927
03:33:43,460 --> 03:33:45,460
I was the last one.

6928
03:33:45,460 --> 03:33:46,460
I'm the last one on my list.

6929
03:33:46,460 --> 03:33:47,460
I got the person.

6930
03:33:47,460 --> 03:33:50,460
So it's just been decided that there's noney for now.

6931
03:33:50,460 --> 03:33:52,460
How did you figure that out?

6932
03:33:52,460 --> 03:33:56,460
I just put the time last time I logged in.

6933
03:33:56,460 --> 03:33:58,460
I didn't log in. I wasn't going to log in.

6934
03:33:58,460 --> 03:34:00,460
What the fuck? I didn't log in the moment.

6935
03:34:00,460 --> 03:34:02,460
And what would they go for?

6936
03:34:02,460 --> 03:34:04,460
And then I took the last window.

6937
03:34:04,460 --> 03:34:06,460
They didn't even open.

6938
03:34:06,460 --> 03:34:08,460
I think I just sort of assumed it was a log file

6939
03:34:08,460 --> 03:34:10,460
because the windows were open.

6940
03:34:10,460 --> 03:34:12,460
But I actually don't really know what they thought.

6941
03:34:12,460 --> 03:34:14,460
I still think it could be gone.

6942
03:34:14,460 --> 03:34:16,460
When the gun thought I was by.

6943
03:34:16,460 --> 03:34:22,460
Glenn was a funny story.

6944
03:34:22,460 --> 03:34:24,460
So after the Bahamas,

6945
03:34:24,460 --> 03:34:26,460
he slides me back to his house.

6946
03:34:26,460 --> 03:34:28,460
At first I thought I was staying at a hotel.

6947
03:34:28,460 --> 03:34:30,460
He said, go to his house.

6948
03:34:30,460 --> 03:34:32,460
And it turns out I was at his house.

6949
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:34,460
Why am I staying here?

6950
03:34:34,460 --> 03:34:36,460
It's too hot right now in Florida.

6951
03:34:36,460 --> 03:34:38,460
And it's too hot in DC.

6952
03:34:38,460 --> 03:34:40,460
You can't put your hotel in.

6953
03:34:40,460 --> 03:34:42,460
You've got to stay here.

6954
03:34:42,460 --> 03:34:44,460
Fortunately, my wife is gone on a vacation.

6955
03:34:44,460 --> 03:34:46,460
But you can stay in her room.

6956
03:34:46,460 --> 03:34:48,460
Her room.

6957
03:34:48,460 --> 03:34:50,460
They haven't slept in the same rooms

6958
03:34:50,460 --> 03:34:52,460
for like ten years.

6959
03:34:52,460 --> 03:34:54,460
So they're separated by the same house.

6960
03:34:54,460 --> 03:34:56,460
Okay, so I stayed in his room.

6961
03:34:56,460 --> 03:34:58,460
I was asleep.

6962
03:34:58,460 --> 03:35:00,460
I was so tired and I had some long flight.

6963
03:35:00,460 --> 03:35:02,460
And then I wake up.

6964
03:35:02,460 --> 03:35:04,460
And you know,

6965
03:35:04,460 --> 03:35:06,460
God save your cigarette.

6966
03:35:06,460 --> 03:35:08,460
He has this colonial house with this kitchen porch.

6967
03:35:08,460 --> 03:35:10,460
And I notice there's like a brick

6968
03:35:10,460 --> 03:35:12,460
in the screen window.

6969
03:35:12,460 --> 03:35:14,460
Yeah.

6970
03:35:14,460 --> 03:35:16,460
I sat there the last night.

6971
03:35:16,460 --> 03:35:18,460
I didn't call it a good story.

6972
03:35:18,460 --> 03:35:20,460
What were you doing at 2am last night?

6973
03:35:20,460 --> 03:35:22,460
I was asleep.

6974
03:35:22,460 --> 03:35:24,460
In bed.

6975
03:35:24,460 --> 03:35:26,460
No, you weren't.

6976
03:35:26,460 --> 03:35:28,460
I heard a car.

6977
03:35:28,460 --> 03:35:30,460
I saw you run to the car.

6978
03:35:30,460 --> 03:35:32,460
They gave him something.

6979
03:35:32,460 --> 03:35:34,460
What did you give him?

6980
03:35:34,460 --> 03:35:36,460
I didn't give him anything.

6981
03:35:36,460 --> 03:35:38,460
I have it all in video.

6982
03:35:38,460 --> 03:35:40,460
And it is this huge 1997 camera

6983
03:35:40,460 --> 03:35:42,460
that you know,

6984
03:35:42,460 --> 03:35:44,460
he has not updated its RAM systems.

6985
03:35:44,460 --> 03:35:46,460
Made by Nintendo.

6986
03:35:46,460 --> 03:35:48,460
Nintendo, yeah.

6987
03:35:48,460 --> 03:35:50,460
And so he starts going through his,

6988
03:35:50,460 --> 03:35:52,460
you know, his fast-forward

6989
03:35:52,460 --> 03:35:54,460
thing in his office.

6990
03:35:54,460 --> 03:35:56,460
He takes me to the office.

6991
03:35:56,460 --> 03:35:58,460
He's like, he's so

6992
03:35:58,460 --> 03:36:00,460
convinced that he's caught a Russian spy

6993
03:36:00,460 --> 03:36:02,460
in his house trying to get out of there.

6994
03:36:02,460 --> 03:36:04,460
Dossier just was published.

6995
03:36:04,460 --> 03:36:06,460
He's like,

6996
03:36:06,460 --> 03:36:08,460
he's out.

6997
03:36:08,460 --> 03:36:10,460
And then,

6998
03:36:10,460 --> 03:36:12,460
around 2am,

6999
03:36:12,460 --> 03:36:14,460
we see a hundred shadowy figure

7000
03:36:14,460 --> 03:36:16,460
approach.

7001
03:36:16,460 --> 03:36:18,460
Wow.

7002
03:36:18,460 --> 03:36:20,460
And I see it.

7003
03:36:20,460 --> 03:36:22,460
And I see the figures sort of stumble and fall.

7004
03:36:22,460 --> 03:36:24,460
And they stand up really quick.

7005
03:36:24,460 --> 03:36:26,460
And I look around and see the camera.

7006
03:36:26,460 --> 03:36:28,460
Glad he's a nice little kid.

7007
03:36:28,460 --> 03:36:30,460
He's strong, he's strong.

7008
03:36:30,460 --> 03:36:32,460
And you can't get into.

7009
03:36:32,460 --> 03:36:34,460
He's trying to slice the window screen.

7010
03:36:34,460 --> 03:36:36,460
The only window that doesn't have an alarm

7011
03:36:36,460 --> 03:36:38,460
is the camera.

7012
03:36:38,460 --> 03:36:40,460
No, no, Glenn Simpson.

7013
03:36:40,460 --> 03:36:42,460
He's going to be a Russian spy

7014
03:36:42,460 --> 03:36:44,460
when his son tries to sneak back in

7015
03:36:44,460 --> 03:36:46,460
for a party.

7016
03:36:46,460 --> 03:36:48,460
Still no apology.

7017
03:36:48,460 --> 03:36:50,460
You guys.

7018
03:36:52,460 --> 03:36:54,460
I appreciate that.

7019
03:36:54,460 --> 03:36:56,460
Well, anything else

7020
03:36:56,460 --> 03:36:58,460
that you think you might be able to help out with

7021
03:36:58,460 --> 03:37:00,460
is what I'm going to do is I've written down

7022
03:37:00,460 --> 03:37:02,460
a list of the stuff that

7023
03:37:02,460 --> 03:37:04,460
you see in Access To.

7024
03:37:04,460 --> 03:37:06,460
And I'm going to be able to do

7025
03:37:06,460 --> 03:37:08,460
some of the project stuff

7026
03:37:08,460 --> 03:37:10,460
that would be useful for someone.

7027
03:37:10,460 --> 03:37:12,460
I don't know.

7028
03:37:12,460 --> 03:37:14,460
I can do

7029
03:37:14,460 --> 03:37:16,460
emails.

7030
03:37:16,460 --> 03:37:18,460
Those are pretty easy.

7031
03:37:18,460 --> 03:37:20,460
Again, social engineering

7032
03:37:20,460 --> 03:37:22,460
I'm pretty good at.

7033
03:37:22,460 --> 03:37:24,460
When I get in that zone

7034
03:37:24,460 --> 03:37:26,460
and turn on the charm,

7035
03:37:26,460 --> 03:37:28,460
I can do fun,

7036
03:37:28,460 --> 03:37:30,460
actually enjoy it sometimes.

7037
03:37:30,460 --> 03:37:32,460
Actually, that would be fun.

7038
03:37:32,460 --> 03:37:34,460
If you need...

7039
03:37:34,460 --> 03:37:36,460
I've been focusing

7040
03:37:36,460 --> 03:37:38,460
just as like any concerned citizen,

7041
03:37:38,460 --> 03:37:40,460
but you guys have to be honest

7042
03:37:40,460 --> 03:37:42,460
so you don't have to answer the question.

7043
03:37:42,460 --> 03:37:44,460
I'm sort of Trump-based.

7044
03:37:44,460 --> 03:37:46,460
People come to me

7045
03:37:46,460 --> 03:37:48,460
with a lot of financial documents

7046
03:37:48,460 --> 03:37:50,460
from all over the world.

7047
03:37:50,460 --> 03:37:52,460
A lot of them are just...

7048
03:37:52,460 --> 03:37:54,460
There's a lot of hoops.

7049
03:37:54,460 --> 03:37:56,460
Some people like Ed from Ireland

7050
03:37:56,460 --> 03:37:58,460
is a legit guy.

7051
03:37:58,460 --> 03:38:00,460
The Catrice Jose guy

7052
03:38:00,460 --> 03:38:02,460
is some sort of state-run guy.

7053
03:38:02,460 --> 03:38:04,460
I don't know.

7054
03:38:04,460 --> 03:38:06,460
But I get a lot of that.

7055
03:38:06,460 --> 03:38:08,460
And then

7056
03:38:08,460 --> 03:38:10,460
there's

7057
03:38:10,460 --> 03:38:12,460
the Epstein thing with the sort of

7058
03:38:12,460 --> 03:38:14,460
a side gig for New York Times.

7059
03:38:14,460 --> 03:38:16,460
But I can

7060
03:38:16,460 --> 03:38:18,460
get that data,

7061
03:38:18,460 --> 03:38:20,460
but I did not want to take the step

7062
03:38:20,460 --> 03:38:22,460
to break in.

7063
03:38:22,460 --> 03:38:24,460
If you need me to do that, I'm happy to break in.

7064
03:38:24,460 --> 03:38:26,460
And if it's legal, and you guys are like

7065
03:38:26,460 --> 03:38:28,460
do legally, let's say

7066
03:38:28,460 --> 03:38:30,460
you can do this, I'll make that.

7067
03:38:30,460 --> 03:38:32,460
Good.

7068
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:34,460
And it would definitely be something

7069
03:38:34,460 --> 03:38:36,460
we would tell you to do with a bunch of other caveats

7070
03:38:36,460 --> 03:38:38,460
and would not be allowed to do.

7071
03:38:38,460 --> 03:38:40,460
But...

7072
03:38:40,460 --> 03:38:42,460
Let's see.

7073
03:38:42,460 --> 03:38:44,460
Let me know if I missed anything too,

7074
03:38:44,460 --> 03:38:46,460
because I have

7075
03:38:46,460 --> 03:38:48,460
Tyler Rossi about MPS.

7076
03:38:48,460 --> 03:38:50,460
He did a man-in-the-mill for

7077
03:38:50,460 --> 03:38:52,460
eating from mom's computer.

7078
03:38:52,460 --> 03:38:54,460
You hacked the rich bank, but not really.

7079
03:38:54,460 --> 03:38:56,460
Right.

7080
03:38:56,460 --> 03:38:58,460
I still can, though.

7081
03:38:58,460 --> 03:39:00,460
I don't know if I'm

7082
03:39:00,460 --> 03:39:02,460
studying or I don't know.

7083
03:39:02,460 --> 03:39:04,460
If you ask me, you should not do any illegal activity.

7084
03:39:04,460 --> 03:39:06,460
That's probably the best

7085
03:39:06,460 --> 03:39:08,460
most of action.

7086
03:39:08,460 --> 03:39:10,460
No, I'm not going to know that for sure.

7087
03:39:10,460 --> 03:39:12,460
I'm not going to talk about that.

7088
03:39:12,460 --> 03:39:14,460
But hacking a bank

7089
03:39:14,460 --> 03:39:16,460
is just hacking the bankers.

7090
03:39:16,460 --> 03:39:18,460
That's true. That's illegal.

7091
03:39:18,460 --> 03:39:20,460
I wouldn't suggest it.

7092
03:39:20,460 --> 03:39:22,460
No, but I mean, in a case,

7093
03:39:22,460 --> 03:39:24,460
it would be something that you would want.

7094
03:39:24,460 --> 03:39:26,460
But can you really hack people like that?

7095
03:39:26,460 --> 03:39:28,460
It's not something

7096
03:39:28,460 --> 03:39:30,460
that we would normally do.

7097
03:39:30,460 --> 03:39:32,460
So, like,

7098
03:39:32,460 --> 03:39:34,460
it's good to know you have the skills, because we could

7099
03:39:34,460 --> 03:39:36,460
put you in a situation where you can talk to other people,

7100
03:39:36,460 --> 03:39:38,460
or we can introduce you to a group,

7101
03:39:38,460 --> 03:39:40,460
or do something else, and you're more complicated.

7102
03:39:40,460 --> 03:39:42,460
But knowing your skills is a good thing to do.

7103
03:39:42,460 --> 03:39:44,460
But it would be rare where I'd be like,

7104
03:39:44,460 --> 03:39:46,460
hey, go hacking a Deutsche Bank,

7105
03:39:46,460 --> 03:39:48,460
deal with this stuff for me,

7106
03:39:48,460 --> 03:39:50,460
because in court, that would be a hell of a thing

7107
03:39:50,460 --> 03:39:52,460
to show that the

7108
03:39:52,460 --> 03:39:54,460
government essentially hacked into a bank to deal with that.

7109
03:39:54,460 --> 03:39:56,460
Well, I know, but there's also

7110
03:39:56,460 --> 03:39:58,460
you guys, I'm sure you have people like this

7111
03:39:58,460 --> 03:40:00,460
in your agency, where other

7112
03:40:00,460 --> 03:40:02,460
agencies have the same types, where you find

7113
03:40:02,460 --> 03:40:04,460
an outside person like myself,

7114
03:40:04,460 --> 03:40:06,460
that you hire basically

7115
03:40:06,460 --> 03:40:08,460
to break the rules, but you don't say to break the rules.

7116
03:40:08,460 --> 03:40:10,460
You need someone that, you don't do that?

7117
03:40:10,460 --> 03:40:12,460
No. No?

7118
03:40:12,460 --> 03:40:14,460
Definitely. Okay.

7119
03:40:14,460 --> 03:40:16,460
I would tell you this, the rule is

7120
03:40:16,460 --> 03:40:18,460
if you were officially working with us,

7121
03:40:18,460 --> 03:40:20,460
you are an extension of the government

7122
03:40:20,460 --> 03:40:22,460
in the sense that if

7123
03:40:22,460 --> 03:40:24,460
you can't do anything I can't do.

7124
03:40:24,460 --> 03:40:26,460
Like a self-contractor.

7125
03:40:26,460 --> 03:40:28,460
Yeah, I guess you can kind of think about it like that.

7126
03:40:28,460 --> 03:40:30,460
You're not employed by the government.

7127
03:40:30,460 --> 03:40:32,460
But like, if I told you to

7128
03:40:32,460 --> 03:40:34,460
hack into something, it'd be like me hacking into it.

7129
03:40:34,460 --> 03:40:36,460
I can't do it, you can't do it.

7130
03:40:36,460 --> 03:40:38,460
Okay, so I'd represent,

7131
03:40:38,460 --> 03:40:40,460
who would you represent in the government?

7132
03:40:40,460 --> 03:40:41,460
Like, or...

7133
03:40:41,460 --> 03:40:42,460
Indirectly, yeah.

7134
03:40:42,460 --> 03:40:44,460
Like, you would give a...

7135
03:40:44,460 --> 03:40:46,460
You would be getting the direction from the government, too, which I mean.

7136
03:40:46,460 --> 03:40:48,460
It's like, there's a floor

7137
03:40:48,460 --> 03:40:49,460
or something.

7138
03:40:49,460 --> 03:40:51,460
The action is filled with government.

7139
03:40:51,460 --> 03:40:52,460
Right, right.

7140
03:40:52,460 --> 03:40:54,460
But technically, it's not, you're not,

7141
03:40:54,460 --> 03:40:55,460
it's not the government.

7142
03:40:55,460 --> 03:40:57,460
And who pays you is not the government either.

7143
03:40:57,460 --> 03:40:59,460
If you're an independent, who,

7144
03:40:59,460 --> 03:41:00,460
how do you pay it?

7145
03:41:00,460 --> 03:41:02,460
You mean, if you were to

7146
03:41:02,460 --> 03:41:03,460
be helping or something?

7147
03:41:03,460 --> 03:41:04,460
Sure.

7148
03:41:04,460 --> 03:41:06,460
Yeah, that's the government.

7149
03:41:06,460 --> 03:41:08,460
Which actually comes from the government?

7150
03:41:08,460 --> 03:41:10,460
No, it would be taxing.

7151
03:41:10,460 --> 03:41:11,460
Oh, okay.

7152
03:41:11,460 --> 03:41:12,460
Yeah.

7153
03:41:12,460 --> 03:41:15,460
But, we don't hire people to break the law.

7154
03:41:15,460 --> 03:41:17,460
Like, to search ventricles.

7155
03:41:17,460 --> 03:41:18,460
Are there any...

7156
03:41:18,460 --> 03:41:19,460
I'm sure they do.

7157
03:41:19,460 --> 03:41:21,460
But that's Oklahoma's stuff.

7158
03:41:21,460 --> 03:41:23,460
So, like, oversees the rules are different, right?

7159
03:41:23,460 --> 03:41:25,460
Like, oversees your

7160
03:41:25,460 --> 03:41:27,460
committing espionage, which is by the fact,

7161
03:41:27,460 --> 03:41:29,460
you know, the fact that we're against the law, right?

7162
03:41:29,460 --> 03:41:30,460
Right.

7163
03:41:30,460 --> 03:41:31,460
And the United States, you know,

7164
03:41:31,460 --> 03:41:33,460
we're still bound by the Constitution.

7165
03:41:33,460 --> 03:41:35,460
So, like, one distinction I want to make, too,

7166
03:41:35,460 --> 03:41:37,460
is like, with the FBI, like,

7167
03:41:37,460 --> 03:41:39,460
we will follow the rules every time.

7168
03:41:39,460 --> 03:41:41,460
I'm never going to tell you to break the rule,

7169
03:41:41,460 --> 03:41:43,460
and like, don't tell me about it or something.

7170
03:41:43,460 --> 03:41:44,460
We'll never deal with that situation.

7171
03:41:44,460 --> 03:41:45,460
Make a win-win.

7172
03:41:45,460 --> 03:41:46,460
Never.

7173
03:41:46,460 --> 03:41:48,460
If I tell you something, like,

7174
03:41:48,460 --> 03:41:50,460
even if I ask you to talk about something

7175
03:41:50,460 --> 03:41:52,460
that could be considered as illegal,

7176
03:41:52,460 --> 03:41:54,460
I'll have a whole document of, like,

7177
03:41:54,460 --> 03:41:56,460
this is exactly what you're allowed to say,

7178
03:41:56,460 --> 03:41:57,460
this is what you're not allowed to say,

7179
03:41:57,460 --> 03:41:59,460
these are the communities,

7180
03:41:59,460 --> 03:42:01,460
and you can't deviate from these four corners.

7181
03:42:01,460 --> 03:42:03,460
Otherwise, we distance ourselves from you,

7182
03:42:03,460 --> 03:42:05,460
because it's not what we ask.

7183
03:42:05,460 --> 03:42:06,460
Okay.

7184
03:42:06,460 --> 03:42:09,460
So, because there's a lot of stuff about what the FBI is,

7185
03:42:09,460 --> 03:42:10,460
or is it?

7186
03:42:10,460 --> 03:42:12,460
Like, just from talking to you today, right?

7187
03:42:12,460 --> 03:42:14,460
There's a lot of stuff that

7188
03:42:14,460 --> 03:42:15,460
you've perceived to be as Jewish.

7189
03:42:15,460 --> 03:42:16,460
Oh, yeah.

7190
03:42:16,460 --> 03:42:17,460
I totally learned a lot today.

7191
03:42:17,460 --> 03:42:18,460
Yeah.

7192
03:42:18,460 --> 03:42:20,460
So, that being said, it's like,

7193
03:42:20,460 --> 03:42:21,460
if you work with us,

7194
03:42:21,460 --> 03:42:23,460
it has to be very clear

7195
03:42:23,460 --> 03:42:25,460
that you're not breaking any rules.

7196
03:42:25,460 --> 03:42:26,460
Right?

7197
03:42:26,460 --> 03:42:28,460
Because we also don't want to work with people

7198
03:42:28,460 --> 03:42:30,460
who are not going to be able to follow directions.

7199
03:42:30,460 --> 03:42:32,460
We talked about it, it makes sense to me,

7200
03:42:32,460 --> 03:42:34,460
but, like, if you're going to give us information, too,

7201
03:42:34,460 --> 03:42:36,460
we have to know that that is the whole fiction.

7202
03:42:36,460 --> 03:42:38,460
You can't, like, take part of it.

7203
03:42:38,460 --> 03:42:40,460
You can't omit the stuff

7204
03:42:40,460 --> 03:42:42,460
that you don't want to tell us,

7205
03:42:42,460 --> 03:42:43,460
and it also has to be everything.

7206
03:42:43,460 --> 03:42:45,460
Because if we find out that it isn't everything,

7207
03:42:45,460 --> 03:42:46,460
then we can't trust you, right?

7208
03:42:46,460 --> 03:42:47,460
Right, right.

7209
03:42:47,460 --> 03:42:48,460
So, you want me to hold back?

7210
03:42:48,460 --> 03:42:49,460
I'm like, Barrett.

7211
03:42:49,460 --> 03:42:52,460
If you ask me, tell me about Barrett.

7212
03:42:52,460 --> 03:42:53,460
So, that would be,

7213
03:42:53,460 --> 03:42:56,460
that would have to be what we have now.

7214
03:42:56,460 --> 03:42:58,460
So, we're not,

7215
03:42:58,460 --> 03:43:02,460
are we really bound to tell you everything I know?

7216
03:43:02,460 --> 03:43:03,460
Not really bound.

7217
03:43:03,460 --> 03:43:04,460
Here's the thing.

7218
03:43:04,460 --> 03:43:06,460
Can I make a mission based on what I think

7219
03:43:06,460 --> 03:43:08,460
is irrelevant and irrelevant?

7220
03:43:08,460 --> 03:43:09,460
Or no?

7221
03:43:09,460 --> 03:43:11,460
It depends, right?

7222
03:43:11,460 --> 03:43:12,460
I mean, like, here's the thing.

7223
03:43:12,460 --> 03:43:14,460
You're not going to be your only source of information.

7224
03:43:14,460 --> 03:43:16,460
That's not how to work either, right?

7225
03:43:16,460 --> 03:43:18,460
I'm going to verify what you say.

7226
03:43:18,460 --> 03:43:19,460
It's like I look at this stuff

7227
03:43:19,460 --> 03:43:20,460
and I'll try to figure out it.

7228
03:43:20,460 --> 03:43:21,460
It's like a report.

7229
03:43:21,460 --> 03:43:22,460
Yeah, it's like a report, right?

7230
03:43:22,460 --> 03:43:24,460
I mean, they're also investigators, so to speak.

7231
03:43:24,460 --> 03:43:26,460
They publish their stuff.

7232
03:43:26,460 --> 03:43:29,460
But, if you were to work with us, right?

7233
03:43:29,460 --> 03:43:32,460
What I need from you most is trust.

7234
03:43:32,460 --> 03:43:34,460
If I can't trust what you're saying,

7235
03:43:34,460 --> 03:43:36,460
if I can't trust you with the information I give you,

7236
03:43:36,460 --> 03:43:38,460
then there's absolutely no reason we would work together.

7237
03:43:38,460 --> 03:43:39,460
Right?

7238
03:43:39,460 --> 03:43:41,460
If we were to involve you in something

7239
03:43:41,460 --> 03:43:43,460
where you are involved with other criminals,

7240
03:43:43,460 --> 03:43:46,460
you say, hey, by the way, I'm working with the FBI,

7241
03:43:46,460 --> 03:43:48,460
that whole thing goes to put them.

7242
03:43:48,460 --> 03:43:49,460
Right?

7243
03:43:49,460 --> 03:43:50,460
I mean, it doesn't help us.

7244
03:43:50,460 --> 03:43:53,460
So that's why you allow this stuff, too.

7245
03:43:53,460 --> 03:43:55,460
If you're here to give us information,

7246
03:43:55,460 --> 03:43:58,460
it was partial information and it was admitted, right?

7247
03:43:58,460 --> 03:44:01,460
There's a part in the court called Discovery, right?

7248
03:44:01,460 --> 03:44:02,460
I'm not sure how it works.

7249
03:44:02,460 --> 03:44:05,460
So with Discovery, we have to provide everything to defend.

7250
03:44:05,460 --> 03:44:07,460
That's how every U.S. government works, right?

7251
03:44:07,460 --> 03:44:10,460
Everything that we have that we're using to prosecute this guy,

7252
03:44:10,460 --> 03:44:11,460
the defense gets a copy of it.

7253
03:44:11,460 --> 03:44:13,460
So they can prosecute any of your stuff, right?

7254
03:44:13,460 --> 03:44:14,460
Right.

7255
03:44:14,460 --> 03:44:16,460
It's getting illegal happening and they...

7256
03:44:16,460 --> 03:44:20,460
So in the case that if you gave us partial information,

7257
03:44:20,460 --> 03:44:22,460
we'd provide that to the defense.

7258
03:44:22,460 --> 03:44:23,460
The defense obviously knows the full story

7259
03:44:23,460 --> 03:44:25,460
because that's the one he's being charged.

7260
03:44:25,460 --> 03:44:27,460
They say, actually, I said a bunch of stuff

7261
03:44:27,460 --> 03:44:28,460
that is exculpatory.

7262
03:44:28,460 --> 03:44:30,460
In other words, stuff that shows that I was innocent,

7263
03:44:30,460 --> 03:44:32,460
but it was selectively filtered out.

7264
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:34,460
Our whole case would go to shit.

7265
03:44:34,460 --> 03:44:36,460
That's a regular job of having this guy.

7266
03:44:36,460 --> 03:44:37,460
Exactly, right.

7267
03:44:37,460 --> 03:44:40,460
So just how it's not fair for Prasada to do that to you, right?

7268
03:44:40,460 --> 03:44:41,460
Right.

7269
03:44:41,460 --> 03:44:45,460
So as the U.S. government, because we are the U.S. government,

7270
03:44:45,460 --> 03:44:48,460
we play exactly by the rules, every time.

7271
03:44:48,460 --> 03:44:50,460
So is there a guy, a middle manager there, at some point,

7272
03:44:50,460 --> 03:44:54,460
that says, I decide what goes into this reporting

7273
03:44:54,460 --> 03:44:55,460
and what does not go into the court?

7274
03:44:55,460 --> 03:44:56,460
So it's not my decision.

7275
03:44:56,460 --> 03:44:59,460
I just give you all the data you ask for, right?

7276
03:44:59,460 --> 03:45:02,460
Without any omission, and someone else makes that decision.

7277
03:45:02,460 --> 03:45:03,460
Okay.

7278
03:45:03,460 --> 03:45:06,460
Yeah, it's usually the case agent who would be working with you

7279
03:45:06,460 --> 03:45:09,460
who would say, okay, hey, I'm going to write this report.

7280
03:45:09,460 --> 03:45:12,460
And we write it in a way that doesn't disclose everything, right?

7281
03:45:12,460 --> 03:45:14,460
Because if I write your name in my report...

7282
03:45:14,460 --> 03:45:16,460
Can I text your identity, but it's still...

7283
03:45:16,460 --> 03:45:18,460
It doesn't hide anything.

7284
03:45:18,460 --> 03:45:23,460
We'll often put you guys in position to make you look bad,

7285
03:45:23,460 --> 03:45:25,460
but, you know, try to get it.

7286
03:45:25,460 --> 03:45:26,460
Try to get it.

7287
03:45:26,460 --> 03:45:27,460
So anyway...

7288
03:45:27,460 --> 03:45:29,460
Cover your ass and get it.

7289
03:45:29,460 --> 03:45:30,460
Right.

7290
03:45:30,460 --> 03:45:32,460
That's just the general way we work with people

7291
03:45:32,460 --> 03:45:34,460
because we work with a lot of different people

7292
03:45:34,460 --> 03:45:35,460
in a lot of different areas of life.

7293
03:45:35,460 --> 03:45:38,460
Like, I work drugs and drug dealers on my account,

7294
03:45:38,460 --> 03:45:40,460
and, you know, we work with them.

7295
03:45:40,460 --> 03:45:41,460
Do we drug you there?

7296
03:45:41,460 --> 03:45:42,460
Mm-hmm.

7297
03:45:42,460 --> 03:45:43,460
Yeah.

7298
03:45:43,460 --> 03:45:44,460
Because we've got to work our way into the chain.

7299
03:45:44,460 --> 03:45:45,460
How else do you think...

7300
03:45:45,460 --> 03:45:46,460
You can't just get the runners all day, right?

7301
03:45:46,460 --> 03:45:47,460
Right.

7302
03:45:47,460 --> 03:45:49,460
You get in the tenants and you get the people at the top

7303
03:45:49,460 --> 03:45:50,460
and try to...

7304
03:45:50,460 --> 03:45:51,460
Back down.

7305
03:45:51,460 --> 03:45:52,460
I don't care.

7306
03:45:52,460 --> 03:45:53,460
It just fucking has to happen.

7307
03:45:53,460 --> 03:45:54,460
It's completely...

7308
03:45:54,460 --> 03:45:55,460
It's completely...

7309
03:45:55,460 --> 03:45:57,460
Kind of like what we said downstairs.

7310
03:45:57,460 --> 03:45:59,460
It's hard, right?

7311
03:45:59,460 --> 03:46:01,460
It's hard to do this job,

7312
03:46:01,460 --> 03:46:02,460
but it should be hard.

7313
03:46:02,460 --> 03:46:03,460
Because of the rules?

7314
03:46:03,460 --> 03:46:04,460
Yeah.

7315
03:46:04,460 --> 03:46:05,460
I mean, the rules are hard.

7316
03:46:05,460 --> 03:46:08,460
Because that thing would be easy for us to do.

7317
03:46:08,460 --> 03:46:10,460
But we're with the new rules.

7318
03:46:10,460 --> 03:46:12,460
That's why we're going to do it with the new rules.

7319
03:46:12,460 --> 03:46:14,460
Because it's the right thing to do.

7320
03:46:14,460 --> 03:46:16,460
Is it like a chain of evidence or a thing?

7321
03:46:16,460 --> 03:46:17,460
Like, there's like a cartel.

7322
03:46:17,460 --> 03:46:19,460
You think, you know, there's a guy's IP address.

7323
03:46:19,460 --> 03:46:21,460
You know, there's email.

7324
03:46:21,460 --> 03:46:24,460
So now that, like, drug dealers are using,

7325
03:46:24,460 --> 03:46:27,460
like, the encrypted chat,

7326
03:46:27,460 --> 03:46:29,460
it doesn't work to go to the telephone company

7327
03:46:29,460 --> 03:46:33,460
and say, hey, we want to get a title-free on this cell phone

7328
03:46:33,460 --> 03:46:35,460
so we can see all the types of things.

7329
03:46:35,460 --> 03:46:37,460
That's all then in the water.

7330
03:46:37,460 --> 03:46:40,460
And now in order to get their communication,

7331
03:46:40,460 --> 03:46:43,460
like, you'd have to actually get a hold of the phone

7332
03:46:43,460 --> 03:46:44,460
and put...

7333
03:46:44,460 --> 03:46:46,460
And honestly, the way to do it is, like,

7334
03:46:46,460 --> 03:46:48,460
you'd have to get someone inside the group.

7335
03:46:48,460 --> 03:46:50,460
Yeah, close on.

7336
03:46:50,460 --> 03:46:52,460
Yeah, even then, like, you need someone to, like,

7337
03:46:52,460 --> 03:46:54,460
20 or 70 men in that phone.

7338
03:46:54,460 --> 03:46:55,460
Can it be an 8?

7339
03:46:55,460 --> 03:46:56,460
Yeah, I got it.

7340
03:46:56,460 --> 03:46:58,460
It still goes back to, like, that thing

7341
03:46:58,460 --> 03:47:00,460
where you have to get someone inside.

7342
03:47:00,460 --> 03:47:02,460
We can't just sit back and rely.

7343
03:47:02,460 --> 03:47:04,460
Yeah, because it's not...

7344
03:47:04,460 --> 03:47:08,460
It's because it's illegal to hack into the phone

7345
03:47:08,460 --> 03:47:12,460
and to bring it back in Christian.

7346
03:47:12,460 --> 03:47:15,460
So even with a proper warrant, you cannot...

7347
03:47:15,460 --> 03:47:18,460
Oh, yeah, exactly. With a proper warrant, you can't

7348
03:47:18,460 --> 03:47:21,460
because the technology is testing against that now.

7349
03:47:21,460 --> 03:47:23,460
It's not the technology itself.

7350
03:47:23,460 --> 03:47:26,460
But if someone can still do it, it's still doable, right?

7351
03:47:26,460 --> 03:47:30,460
Like, if someone was using some app that the data was still

7352
03:47:30,460 --> 03:47:32,460
housed with the service provider,

7353
03:47:32,460 --> 03:47:34,460
then, yeah, yeah, it would do it.

7354
03:47:34,460 --> 03:47:36,460
Because it's legally within the phone

7355
03:47:36,460 --> 03:47:39,460
and that company legally has the content.

7356
03:47:39,460 --> 03:47:41,460
Is it too much for me to ask, like,

7357
03:47:41,460 --> 03:47:43,460
what is legally outside the phone?

7358
03:47:43,460 --> 03:47:46,460
Well, you can even ask about that.

7359
03:47:46,460 --> 03:47:49,460
And it's just an hacking situation.

7360
03:47:49,460 --> 03:47:52,460
Like, if you know a cartel guy and you have a warrant,

7361
03:47:52,460 --> 03:47:55,460
what can you legally not do?

7362
03:47:55,460 --> 03:47:58,460
Yeah, I think maybe it's easier.

7363
03:47:58,460 --> 03:48:00,460
I'm just curious.

7364
03:48:00,460 --> 03:48:04,460
You can't break any law in order to get access to that guy.

7365
03:48:04,460 --> 03:48:06,460
Still the right?

7366
03:48:06,460 --> 03:48:08,460
No, we can't do that happen.

7367
03:48:08,460 --> 03:48:09,460
You can't?

7368
03:48:09,460 --> 03:48:11,460
Yeah, no, we can't.

7369
03:48:11,460 --> 03:48:13,460
Yeah, throughout the hacking or anything.

7370
03:48:13,460 --> 03:48:15,460
And giving a court order or a search warrant

7371
03:48:15,460 --> 03:48:18,460
to an ISP or a telecom provider is not hacking.

7372
03:48:18,460 --> 03:48:21,460
There's a law that says we can do that.

7373
03:48:21,460 --> 03:48:23,460
The warrant is what permits us to get things

7374
03:48:23,460 --> 03:48:25,460
that are under reasonable expectation of privacy,

7375
03:48:25,460 --> 03:48:27,460
which is what you're hacking.

7376
03:48:27,460 --> 03:48:30,460
You're hacking because it's not publicly available.

7377
03:48:30,460 --> 03:48:32,460
So if you have to breach that expectation of privacy,

7378
03:48:32,460 --> 03:48:35,460
we need a warrant as a government to get that.

7379
03:48:35,460 --> 03:48:37,460
The warrant will specify what you can and can't do.

7380
03:48:37,460 --> 03:48:40,460
And you can break expectation of privacy.

7381
03:48:40,460 --> 03:48:43,460
And if this is all to protect against, you know,

7382
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:46,460
all the crazy shit that goes on and abuses and things like that.

7383
03:48:46,460 --> 03:48:48,460
So, like, I mean, as much as the government

7384
03:48:48,460 --> 03:48:50,460
does kind of a fuck up shit show,

7385
03:48:50,460 --> 03:48:53,460
I mean, it is put up in a way to protect people,

7386
03:48:53,460 --> 03:48:54,460
protect American people.

7387
03:48:54,460 --> 03:48:56,460
Their privacy, their liberty, things like that.

7388
03:48:56,460 --> 03:48:57,460
So when people think like,

7389
03:48:57,460 --> 03:48:58,460
like my mom does the same thing,

7390
03:48:58,460 --> 03:49:00,460
she's like, well, are you reading my e-mail that I love?

7391
03:49:00,460 --> 03:49:01,460
I don't have time to read your e-mail.

7392
03:49:01,460 --> 03:49:02,460
One.

7393
03:49:02,460 --> 03:49:04,460
And two, like, why would I be reading your e-mail?

7394
03:49:04,460 --> 03:49:05,460
That doesn't make any sense.

7395
03:49:05,460 --> 03:49:06,460
Trust me, I did it.

7396
03:49:06,460 --> 03:49:07,460
You don't want to read your mom's e-mail.

7397
03:49:07,460 --> 03:49:11,460
You don't want to do that.

7398
03:49:11,460 --> 03:49:13,460
Can't go backwards.

7399
03:49:13,460 --> 03:49:14,460
You can't.

7400
03:49:14,460 --> 03:49:15,460
I'm going to do that.

7401
03:49:15,460 --> 03:49:16,460
You can't ever go backwards.

7402
03:49:16,460 --> 03:49:17,460
Yeah, so there's...

7403
03:49:17,460 --> 03:49:18,460
I get it.

7404
03:49:18,460 --> 03:49:20,460
Yeah, there's limitations that we work under, but...

7405
03:49:20,460 --> 03:49:21,460
I like that.

7406
03:49:21,460 --> 03:49:22,460
It's fine.

7407
03:49:22,460 --> 03:49:26,460
It's like, you know, everyone has to have a...

7408
03:49:26,460 --> 03:49:28,460
Yeah, we play about the rules.

7409
03:49:28,460 --> 03:49:30,460
But when we do win, right,

7410
03:49:30,460 --> 03:49:32,460
when we do arrest someone or something like that,

7411
03:49:32,460 --> 03:49:34,460
our cases are, you know, airtight, right?

7412
03:49:34,460 --> 03:49:36,460
We've covered every angle that we can.

7413
03:49:36,460 --> 03:49:37,460
We've got all the information,

7414
03:49:37,460 --> 03:49:39,460
and we've vetted everything to make sure that,

7415
03:49:39,460 --> 03:49:40,460
we have the right person, right?

7416
03:49:40,460 --> 03:49:42,460
We want to make sure we have the right person,

7417
03:49:42,460 --> 03:49:44,460
and we have everything that leads up to it.

7418
03:49:44,460 --> 03:49:46,460
So, anyway, that's all just background

7419
03:49:46,460 --> 03:49:48,460
on how we work and how we work with sources

7420
03:49:48,460 --> 03:49:49,460
and stuff like that.

7421
03:49:49,460 --> 03:49:50,460
That's good.

7422
03:49:50,460 --> 03:49:52,460
I like to do extremely different things.

7423
03:49:52,460 --> 03:49:54,460
Karen, it's really like Tim and Jami.

7424
03:49:54,460 --> 03:49:56,460
Tim and Jami are very different.

7425
03:49:56,460 --> 03:49:58,460
Yeah, because I think that's the other thing, too,

7426
03:49:58,460 --> 03:50:00,460
is if we break the rules to get to our end of goal,

7427
03:50:00,460 --> 03:50:02,460
how are we getting better than the bad guys?

7428
03:50:02,460 --> 03:50:03,460
Right.

7429
03:50:03,460 --> 03:50:04,460
Right, and just fighting.

7430
03:50:04,460 --> 03:50:05,460
Yeah, it's easy.

7431
03:50:05,460 --> 03:50:07,460
I mean, it'd be easy for me to hack into a bunch of stuff,

7432
03:50:07,460 --> 03:50:09,460
but then I'm just a hacker.

7433
03:50:09,460 --> 03:50:12,460
I'm just a criminal doing rogue stuff.

7434
03:50:12,460 --> 03:50:14,460
Oh, vigilante.

7435
03:50:14,460 --> 03:50:16,460
True, but vigilante is just not far.

7436
03:50:16,460 --> 03:50:19,460
Anyway, that goes a whole different term.

7437
03:50:19,460 --> 03:50:21,460
Let's say that for a team of group.

7438
03:50:21,460 --> 03:50:22,460
Okay.

7439
03:50:24,460 --> 03:50:25,460
So, what else do I have?

7440
03:50:25,460 --> 03:50:27,460
Okay, we talked about Irish bank fraud.

7441
03:50:27,460 --> 03:50:31,460
OCCP, you're an admin on Hunter.d.gov.

7442
03:50:31,460 --> 03:50:32,460
Both.

7443
03:50:32,460 --> 03:50:33,460
Both.

7444
03:50:33,460 --> 03:50:34,460
Both.

7445
03:50:34,460 --> 03:50:35,460
Both.

7446
03:50:35,460 --> 03:50:37,460
The use of OCCP.

7447
03:50:37,460 --> 03:50:38,460
OCCRP, yeah.

7448
03:50:38,460 --> 03:50:39,460
OCCRP is down?

7449
03:50:39,460 --> 03:50:40,460
No, it's up.

7450
03:50:40,460 --> 03:50:41,460
Okay, yeah.

7451
03:50:41,460 --> 03:50:42,460
So, you're an admin on goal?

7452
03:50:42,460 --> 03:50:43,460
Yeah.

7453
03:50:43,460 --> 03:50:45,460
Well, I have an accent.

7454
03:50:45,460 --> 03:50:46,460
Okay.

7455
03:50:46,460 --> 03:50:47,460
And...

7456
03:50:47,460 --> 03:50:49,460
I know how to understand the documents, too,

7457
03:50:49,460 --> 03:50:50,460
which is...

7458
03:50:50,460 --> 03:50:53,460
I've learned a lot from the government.

7459
03:50:53,460 --> 03:50:56,460
So, if you need to...

7460
03:50:56,460 --> 03:50:58,460
If you want to know what a CLO is,

7461
03:50:58,460 --> 03:51:00,460
why it's important that it happens in 2008

7462
03:51:00,460 --> 03:51:04,460
in Ireland versus the UK,

7463
03:51:04,460 --> 03:51:06,460
I can help you understand that.

7464
03:51:06,460 --> 03:51:07,460
Okay.

7465
03:51:08,460 --> 03:51:09,460
We'll see.

7466
03:51:09,460 --> 03:51:10,460
You have...

7467
03:51:10,460 --> 03:51:12,460
David Eichrich has...

7468
03:51:12,460 --> 03:51:16,460
Well, I guess he tasks you to get into Epstein D-Mail

7469
03:51:16,460 --> 03:51:19,460
and his Epstein Y-C-Mail.

7470
03:51:19,460 --> 03:51:21,460
You know what he's password-wise?

7471
03:51:21,460 --> 03:51:23,460
It's up line.

7472
03:51:23,460 --> 03:51:24,460
It's a G-21.

7473
03:51:24,460 --> 03:51:25,460
A little...

7474
03:51:25,460 --> 03:51:26,460
I hit it.

7475
03:51:26,460 --> 03:51:28,460
A little same job.

7476
03:51:28,460 --> 03:51:29,460
A little...

7477
03:51:29,460 --> 03:51:30,460
Little...

7478
03:51:30,460 --> 03:51:31,460
A little same job.

7479
03:51:31,460 --> 03:51:32,460
A little same job.

7480
03:51:32,460 --> 03:51:33,460
A little same job.

7481
03:51:33,460 --> 03:51:34,460
A little same job.

7482
03:51:34,460 --> 03:51:35,460
A little same job.

7483
03:51:35,460 --> 03:51:36,460
A little same job.

7484
03:51:36,460 --> 03:51:37,460
A little same job.

7485
03:51:37,460 --> 03:51:38,460
A little same job.

7486
03:51:38,460 --> 03:51:39,460
A little same job.

7487
03:51:39,460 --> 03:51:41,460
You can just look at the old hacks from...

7488
03:51:41,460 --> 03:51:42,460
Oh, right.

7489
03:51:42,460 --> 03:51:43,460
Yeah, pretty easy.

7490
03:51:43,460 --> 03:51:45,460
But don't tell anybody.

7491
03:51:45,460 --> 03:51:49,460
You're also in a single group with Barrett,

7492
03:51:49,460 --> 03:51:54,460
Emma, Van, your friend,

7493
03:51:54,460 --> 03:51:56,460
and like a hundred other people there.

7494
03:51:56,460 --> 03:51:57,460
And a lot of journalists.

7495
03:51:57,460 --> 03:51:58,460
Journalists.

7496
03:51:58,460 --> 03:51:59,460
Journalists.

7497
03:51:59,460 --> 03:52:00,460
Journalists.

7498
03:52:00,460 --> 03:52:01,460
Okay.

7499
03:52:01,460 --> 03:52:02,460
You're capable of doing some email hacks

7500
03:52:02,460 --> 03:52:06,460
and then you'll do some light forensics.

7501
03:52:06,460 --> 03:52:08,460
I guess with this single group...

7502
03:52:08,460 --> 03:52:09,460
There's a big difference.

7503
03:52:09,460 --> 03:52:10,460
Okay.

7504
03:52:10,460 --> 03:52:11,460
Not like that.

7505
03:52:11,460 --> 03:52:12,460
That's...

7506
03:52:12,460 --> 03:52:13,460
I've been practicing a lot with that.

7507
03:52:13,460 --> 03:52:16,460
That's like my latest interest.

7508
03:52:16,460 --> 03:52:17,460
But mostly...

7509
03:52:17,460 --> 03:52:18,460
But with the software.

7510
03:52:18,460 --> 03:52:20,460
It happened, you know, not on my own.

7511
03:52:20,460 --> 03:52:22,460
I'm not coding it or writing it.

7512
03:52:22,460 --> 03:52:24,460
I don't think many people are coding it

7513
03:52:24,460 --> 03:52:25,460
or writing it themselves.

7514
03:52:25,460 --> 03:52:26,460
No, I'm very good.

7515
03:52:26,460 --> 03:52:28,460
I think it's a little bit better than...

7516
03:52:28,460 --> 03:52:30,460
But yeah, with Magnet, it was open source.

7517
03:52:30,460 --> 03:52:32,460
But with Magnet, of course, it's better.

7518
03:52:32,460 --> 03:52:33,460
Yeah, it's not like that.

7519
03:52:33,460 --> 03:52:34,460
I can prove that to you.

7520
03:52:34,460 --> 03:52:37,460
You need to do a demonstration of that.

7521
03:52:37,460 --> 03:52:38,460
Okay.

7522
03:52:38,460 --> 03:52:41,460
In a single group, you said Barrett...

7523
03:52:41,460 --> 03:52:43,460
Barrett said that he's not getting anything legal.

7524
03:52:43,460 --> 03:52:44,460
Is that right?

7525
03:52:44,460 --> 03:52:45,460
Or not getting anything stupid?

7526
03:52:45,460 --> 03:52:46,460
No.

7527
03:52:46,460 --> 03:52:48,460
He's always saying something stupid.

7528
03:52:48,460 --> 03:52:50,460
But he's just, you know, he's such a rabble.

7529
03:52:50,460 --> 03:52:53,460
Let's see what happens after he calms down a bit.

7530
03:52:53,460 --> 03:52:55,460
Because he was high a lot.

7531
03:52:55,460 --> 03:52:56,460
Okay.

7532
03:52:56,460 --> 03:52:57,460
He was very high.

7533
03:52:57,460 --> 03:52:59,460
And he was not happy.

7534
03:52:59,460 --> 03:53:01,460
So it was more worried about him.

7535
03:53:01,460 --> 03:53:03,460
No one really took it seriously.

7536
03:53:03,460 --> 03:53:06,460
You said the rest of the stuff in that group is mainly...

7537
03:53:06,460 --> 03:53:08,460
People miscontented about stuff.

7538
03:53:08,460 --> 03:53:09,460
Yeah.

7539
03:53:09,460 --> 03:53:11,460
You said these steps are basically just bitching a lot.

7540
03:53:11,460 --> 03:53:12,460
But like...

7541
03:53:12,460 --> 03:53:14,460
A lot of, like, fuck movies meant, you know...

7542
03:53:14,460 --> 03:53:17,460
And like, well, actually, I couldn't want to fuck movies meant.

7543
03:53:17,460 --> 03:53:19,460
You know, like, well, why would you want to do that?

7544
03:53:19,460 --> 03:53:21,460
You know, it's like that stuff.

7545
03:53:21,460 --> 03:53:23,460
You know, look at this Twitter post.

7546
03:53:23,460 --> 03:53:26,460
Or this cop just beat up this woman on the street.

7547
03:53:26,460 --> 03:53:28,460
You know, there's a lot of that, too.

7548
03:53:28,460 --> 03:53:29,460
Okay.

7549
03:53:29,460 --> 03:53:30,460
With the riots and stuff.

7550
03:53:30,460 --> 03:53:31,460
Sure.

7551
03:53:31,460 --> 03:53:35,460
But if you're asking if there's, like, organization or people are getting together and, you know...

7552
03:53:36,460 --> 03:53:38,460
I think they're very watched.

7553
03:53:38,460 --> 03:53:40,460
You know, there's no organization.

7554
03:53:40,460 --> 03:53:41,460
It's like, it's just chaos.

7555
03:53:41,460 --> 03:53:42,460
It's fun to see what happens.

7556
03:53:42,460 --> 03:53:44,460
It's like, Mike, I'm out of it, yeah.

7557
03:53:44,460 --> 03:53:46,460
And I meet some interesting people.

7558
03:53:46,460 --> 03:53:48,460
There's nothing, nothing explicitly illegal.

7559
03:53:48,460 --> 03:53:53,460
They don't talk about, you know, collectivity or hacking stuff or anything like that.

7560
03:53:53,460 --> 03:53:54,460
Why?

7561
03:53:54,460 --> 03:53:55,460
Well, yeah, of course.

7562
03:53:55,460 --> 03:53:57,460
No, there is a talk about that, yeah.

7563
03:53:57,460 --> 03:53:59,460
But it's like a friend of mine says,

7564
03:53:59,460 --> 03:54:08,460
Oh, do you know how I get ISPs from Prague, you know, circa 2016?

7565
03:54:08,460 --> 03:54:10,460
Clearly, you're trying to find a common shit, right?

7566
03:54:10,460 --> 03:54:12,460
You know, everyone's a loving the baby.

7567
03:54:12,460 --> 03:54:14,460
You know, stuff like that, you know.

7568
03:54:14,460 --> 03:54:16,460
And if you have it, you have nowhere to get it.

7569
03:54:16,460 --> 03:54:18,460
I think the city's sure to hear you though.

7570
03:54:18,460 --> 03:54:19,460
There's a link.

7571
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:20,460
Do you know what Irish bankers are?

7572
03:54:20,460 --> 03:54:23,460
The other day, I mean, an Irish banker that knows how to do,

7573
03:54:23,460 --> 03:54:25,460
you know, anybody in Ireland right now.

7574
03:54:25,460 --> 03:54:27,460
I'm here to get some coin telegraph.

7575
03:54:27,460 --> 03:54:29,460
Yeah, stuff like that.

7576
03:54:29,460 --> 03:54:35,460
But like, I'm the only idiot that says, Hey, Emma,

7577
03:54:35,460 --> 03:54:38,460
can you give me a favor and help me hack David Emmerich?

7578
03:54:38,460 --> 03:54:40,460
Because I got to get into his fucking email.

7579
03:54:40,460 --> 03:54:42,460
I'm the only idiot that says that.

7580
03:54:42,460 --> 03:54:44,460
So, yeah.

7581
03:54:44,460 --> 03:54:45,460
Okay.

7582
03:54:45,460 --> 03:54:48,460
So no one else crossed about like who's behind pass or who's behind it?

7583
03:54:48,460 --> 03:54:49,460
Oh, yeah.

7584
03:54:49,460 --> 03:54:50,460
I know.

7585
03:54:50,460 --> 03:54:51,460
Yeah.

7586
03:54:51,460 --> 03:54:53,460
There's a really good big discussion on who's behind Lowe's.

7587
03:54:53,460 --> 03:54:55,460
Oh, Lowe's, I think.

7588
03:54:55,460 --> 03:55:00,460
Or, well, no, the abbreviated version of Lowe's.

7589
03:55:00,460 --> 03:55:01,460
Okay.

7590
03:55:01,460 --> 03:55:03,460
It's like a, whoever did the came out.

7591
03:55:03,460 --> 03:55:04,460
Oh, yeah.

7592
03:55:04,460 --> 03:55:06,460
Who did they think the came out of?

7593
03:55:06,460 --> 03:55:09,460
I think they, I mean, what are some of the opinions of?

7594
03:55:09,460 --> 03:55:12,460
All I know is my opinion right now, as I can remember,

7595
03:55:12,460 --> 03:55:14,460
and I'm not holding back or meaning information,

7596
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:16,460
because I just can't remember.

7597
03:55:16,460 --> 03:55:18,460
But if you give me time to look, I'll find it for you.

7598
03:55:18,460 --> 03:55:21,460
My opinion is, I think it's Emma.

7599
03:55:21,460 --> 03:55:24,460
The Spanish, the Spanish is broken.

7600
03:55:24,460 --> 03:55:27,460
Again, Maria speaks eight languages for sure.

7601
03:55:27,460 --> 03:55:29,460
I mean, it's not the first.

7602
03:55:29,460 --> 03:55:30,460
It's not a native speaker.

7603
03:55:30,460 --> 03:55:31,460
It's not a native speaker.

7604
03:55:31,460 --> 03:55:36,460
And the angry, the anger sort of matches Emma's anger.

7605
03:55:36,460 --> 03:55:39,460
And the thought process that makes, gets you to write a certain sentence,

7606
03:55:39,460 --> 03:55:41,460
matches Harry's thought process.

7607
03:55:41,460 --> 03:55:42,460
The way I educated it anyway.

7608
03:55:42,460 --> 03:55:44,460
You know, you have to, in order to say the certain sentence,

7609
03:55:44,460 --> 03:55:46,460
you have to think and feel the sort of thing.

7610
03:55:46,460 --> 03:55:48,460
We're in the, we're in this frame group.

7611
03:55:48,460 --> 03:55:50,460
And I see that pattern matched with it.

7612
03:55:50,460 --> 03:55:54,460
So what Spanish document was it that matched?

7613
03:55:54,460 --> 03:55:55,460
The manifesto.

7614
03:55:55,460 --> 03:55:56,460
Oh, the manifesto.

7615
03:55:56,460 --> 03:55:57,460
No.

7616
03:55:57,460 --> 03:55:58,460
Okay.

7617
03:55:58,460 --> 03:55:59,460
Interesting.

7618
03:55:59,460 --> 03:56:00,460
So aside from like the speech pattern,

7619
03:56:00,460 --> 03:56:02,460
is there anything else, any other reason why you think

7620
03:56:02,460 --> 03:56:04,460
the best is behind the game of the island?

7621
03:56:04,460 --> 03:56:07,460
Well, the thought process, obviously.

7622
03:56:07,460 --> 03:56:08,460
Yeah.

7623
03:56:08,460 --> 03:56:09,460
The motivation, I guess, right?

7624
03:56:09,460 --> 03:56:10,460
It's really angry.

7625
03:56:10,460 --> 03:56:11,460
Well, no, no more.

7626
03:56:11,460 --> 03:56:14,460
The motivation, well, you must know.

7627
03:56:14,460 --> 03:56:16,460
I mean, if you're angry, you know,

7628
03:56:16,460 --> 03:56:19,460
the motivation is just, you can do it.

7629
03:56:19,460 --> 03:56:21,460
You know, sometimes, yeah, you're broke, you need some money.

7630
03:56:21,460 --> 03:56:24,460
Or if you want to, you know, see, I'm better than you or not.

7631
03:56:24,460 --> 03:56:26,460
But it's like, here's a challenge.

7632
03:56:26,460 --> 03:56:28,460
You know, that's most of the motivation.

7633
03:56:28,460 --> 03:56:30,460
You should know that though, right?

7634
03:56:30,460 --> 03:56:31,460
But it's different, too.

7635
03:56:31,460 --> 03:56:32,460
Oh, you mean political motivation.

7636
03:56:32,460 --> 03:56:33,460
There's different motivations, too,

7637
03:56:33,460 --> 03:56:34,460
with different hackers, too, right?

7638
03:56:34,460 --> 03:56:36,460
Some hackers are just curious.

7639
03:56:36,460 --> 03:56:38,460
Like, they just want to see if they can break the system.

7640
03:56:38,460 --> 03:56:40,460
But they're the ones who hack for a purpose, right?

7641
03:56:40,460 --> 03:56:42,460
Like, a lot of the hack-tivists out there,

7642
03:56:42,460 --> 03:56:43,460
you know, they'll hack because...

7643
03:56:43,460 --> 03:56:44,460
We'll leak something.

7644
03:56:44,460 --> 03:56:45,460
What about...

7645
03:56:45,460 --> 03:56:47,460
We're talking about we'll leak, aren't we?

7646
03:56:47,460 --> 03:56:48,460
What about we'll leak?

7647
03:56:48,460 --> 03:56:50,460
That's what you're asking about.

7648
03:56:50,460 --> 03:56:52,460
Well, there's a bunch of different types of things.

7649
03:56:52,460 --> 03:56:53,460
I don't know.

7650
03:56:53,460 --> 03:56:58,460
So, the boot leaks appeared on...

7651
03:56:58,460 --> 03:57:01,460
Honestly, I don't know why he was going after it.

7652
03:57:01,460 --> 03:57:03,460
I don't think he did it.

7653
03:57:03,460 --> 03:57:05,460
At first, I think it became the one.

7654
03:57:05,460 --> 03:57:06,460
I don't think he did boot leaks.

7655
03:57:06,460 --> 03:57:08,460
Boot leaks was...

7656
03:57:08,460 --> 03:57:11,460
But you know, and I'm sure you know,

7657
03:57:11,460 --> 03:57:15,460
and I'm sure you know that your computer systems are outdated.

7658
03:57:15,460 --> 03:57:16,460
Right?

7659
03:57:16,460 --> 03:57:17,460
Okay?

7660
03:57:17,460 --> 03:57:19,460
You're fucking really outdated, right?

7661
03:57:19,460 --> 03:57:22,460
And the FBI's computer systems are outdated.

7662
03:57:22,460 --> 03:57:25,460
What do you think the local sheriff's fucking office in Minnesota

7663
03:57:25,460 --> 03:57:28,460
is still running, like, Windows NT, right?

7664
03:57:28,460 --> 03:57:31,460
So, it's not difficult, you know?

7665
03:57:31,460 --> 03:57:34,460
And I think it's consortium.

7666
03:57:34,460 --> 03:57:37,460
My personal opinion, based on no evidence at all,

7667
03:57:37,460 --> 03:57:42,460
is that consortium hackers just have to talk about the...

7668
03:57:42,460 --> 03:57:44,460
the Black Lives Matter, I think, to talk about the police

7669
03:57:44,460 --> 03:57:46,460
and here's the revenge.

7670
03:57:46,460 --> 03:57:49,460
I don't think it was, you know,

7671
03:57:49,460 --> 03:57:51,460
politically motivated by...

7672
03:57:51,460 --> 03:57:56,460
motivated by some, like, left-wing George Soros fucking thing.

7673
03:57:56,460 --> 03:57:58,460
You know, conspiracy theory, right?

7674
03:57:58,460 --> 03:58:00,460
Just angry kids, you know?

7675
03:58:00,460 --> 03:58:01,460
That's it.

7676
03:58:01,460 --> 03:58:02,460
That's right.

7677
03:58:02,460 --> 03:58:03,460
But I could be wrong.

7678
03:58:03,460 --> 03:58:05,460
I'm off the wrong side.

7679
03:58:05,460 --> 03:58:07,460
So, you don't think you have a vested behind that

7680
03:58:07,460 --> 03:58:09,460
that she's behind King Island and what else?

7681
03:58:09,460 --> 03:58:11,460
I personally, I think, came here.

7682
03:58:11,460 --> 03:58:15,460
Because just her reaction to my asking for the 100,000

7683
03:58:15,460 --> 03:58:18,460
in Bitcoin, Deutsche Bank, was sort of took me off.

7684
03:58:18,460 --> 03:58:21,460
You don't react like that if you just move.

7685
03:58:21,460 --> 03:58:23,460
Interesting.

7686
03:58:23,460 --> 03:58:26,460
Yeah, because she doesn't want to share it, though.

7687
03:58:26,460 --> 03:58:27,460
Yeah.

7688
03:58:27,460 --> 03:58:31,460
There's a prize attached to it, so...

7689
03:58:31,460 --> 03:58:32,460
so there was...

7690
03:58:32,460 --> 03:58:33,460
so that...

7691
03:58:33,460 --> 03:58:35,460
he said there was, like, a lot of discussion about who...

7692
03:58:35,460 --> 03:58:37,460
or was it the King and Stink that there was a lot of discussion

7693
03:58:37,460 --> 03:58:39,460
in the group of who...

7694
03:58:39,460 --> 03:58:40,460
Yeah.

7695
03:58:40,460 --> 03:58:44,460
But just for the King and Stink right now, so...

7696
03:58:44,460 --> 03:58:46,460
Well, Formation Towns as well.

7697
03:58:46,460 --> 03:58:48,460
I've done it before.

7698
03:58:48,460 --> 03:58:51,460
But actually, there was no discussion.

7699
03:58:51,460 --> 03:58:52,460
That's interesting.

7700
03:58:52,460 --> 03:58:53,460
You have a good point.

7701
03:58:53,460 --> 03:58:55,460
Yeah, there was no discussion for Formation Towns.

7702
03:58:55,460 --> 03:58:57,460
That means that everybody didn't get it.

7703
03:58:57,460 --> 03:58:58,460
Oh, yeah.

7704
03:58:58,460 --> 03:59:00,460
So that's why it's the way I take out statements.

7705
03:59:00,460 --> 03:59:01,460
Yeah.

7706
03:59:01,460 --> 03:59:03,460
But since there was a lot of discussion for, like,

7707
03:59:03,460 --> 03:59:06,460
payments, that means no one really knew who did it.

7708
03:59:06,460 --> 03:59:08,460
Who did Formation Towns?

7709
03:59:08,460 --> 03:59:09,460
I don't know.

7710
03:59:09,460 --> 03:59:10,460
It wasn't you.

7711
03:59:10,460 --> 03:59:11,460
I just joined the...

7712
03:59:11,460 --> 03:59:12,460
the thing in the...

7713
03:59:12,460 --> 03:59:14,460
well, Marie was stuck in France,

7714
03:59:14,460 --> 03:59:16,460
so that was the summer of last year.

7715
03:59:16,460 --> 03:59:18,460
That's when that happened.

7716
03:59:18,460 --> 03:59:20,460
But I did tell Tim Jeremy, like,

7717
03:59:20,460 --> 03:59:22,460
hey, he did it.

7718
03:59:22,460 --> 03:59:23,460
You know?

7719
03:59:23,460 --> 03:59:24,460
Yeah.

7720
03:59:24,460 --> 03:59:26,460
And, oh, God, oh, the whip, yeah.

7721
03:59:26,460 --> 03:59:28,460
Okay, so I...

7722
03:59:28,460 --> 03:59:30,460
at this point, I'm wondering, you know,

7723
03:59:30,460 --> 03:59:32,460
I was working with the FBI, the source.

7724
03:59:32,460 --> 03:59:33,460
Well, Emma said to me,

7725
03:59:33,460 --> 03:59:36,460
I need you to relay a message to the FBI.

7726
03:59:36,460 --> 03:59:37,460
I was like, what?

7727
03:59:37,460 --> 03:59:39,460
I said, yes, I want you to give these guys a message.

7728
03:59:39,460 --> 03:59:40,460
Okay.

7729
03:59:40,460 --> 03:59:42,460
I'm like, tell them about Formation Towns.

7730
03:59:42,460 --> 03:59:45,460
I want you to give them a list of people you've...

7731
03:59:45,460 --> 03:59:46,460
that are...

7732
03:59:46,460 --> 03:59:47,460
and I have it.

7733
03:59:47,460 --> 03:59:48,460
I can give you the email.

7734
03:59:48,460 --> 03:59:50,460
I'll just forward it to you when I get a chance.

7735
03:59:50,460 --> 03:59:51,460
Remind me, text me.

7736
03:59:51,460 --> 03:59:52,460
I don't forget.

7737
03:59:52,460 --> 03:59:54,460
And I gave it to Tim.

7738
03:59:54,460 --> 03:59:55,460
I gave it to Jeremy.

7739
03:59:55,460 --> 03:59:56,460
And they were not...

7740
03:59:56,460 --> 03:59:57,460
they were like, okay, great.

7741
03:59:57,460 --> 03:59:58,460
We don't really care.

7742
03:59:58,460 --> 03:59:59,460
Like, give one to a Deutsche Bank.

7743
03:59:59,460 --> 04:00:01,460
We don't care about Formation Towns.

7744
04:00:01,460 --> 04:00:04,460
And Emma felt like she was not heard by the FBI

7745
04:00:04,460 --> 04:00:06,460
because she wanted to help,

7746
04:00:06,460 --> 04:00:08,460
but she was not heard.

7747
04:00:08,460 --> 04:00:09,460
She was offering help.

7748
04:00:09,460 --> 04:00:12,460
She said, look, I'll give you guys the data.

7749
04:00:12,460 --> 04:00:13,460
You have a time limit.

7750
04:00:13,460 --> 04:00:15,460
That's why it's going to go live in a month.

7751
04:00:15,460 --> 04:00:18,460
I'll give you three months to find the information.

7752
04:00:18,460 --> 04:00:20,460
I'll forward it to you.

7753
04:00:20,460 --> 04:00:21,460
Okay.

7754
04:00:21,460 --> 04:00:23,460
I'm just writing a line to someone to text you.

7755
04:00:23,460 --> 04:00:24,460
Yeah.

7756
04:00:24,460 --> 04:00:26,460
I don't know if we got it.

7757
04:00:26,460 --> 04:00:28,460
That's what I'm writing.

7758
04:00:28,460 --> 04:00:30,460
Okay.

7759
04:00:30,460 --> 04:00:31,460
All right.

7760
04:00:31,460 --> 04:00:33,460
Any other signal groups that...

7761
04:00:33,460 --> 04:00:35,460
that you're part of that talk about hacking?

7762
04:00:35,460 --> 04:00:36,460
Yeah.

7763
04:00:36,460 --> 04:00:37,460
Well, they're all...

7764
04:00:37,460 --> 04:00:39,460
I mean, all the varied groups.

7765
04:00:39,460 --> 04:00:41,460
I call them varied groups, but they're all, like, options.

7766
04:00:41,460 --> 04:00:42,460
Oh, no.

7767
04:00:42,460 --> 04:00:44,460
The Formation Towns one is still like this.

7768
04:00:44,460 --> 04:00:46,460
But, you know, it's like...

7769
04:00:46,460 --> 04:00:48,460
Well, I mean, no one's really posted for like,

7770
04:00:48,460 --> 04:00:49,460
like seven months.

7771
04:00:49,460 --> 04:00:50,460
Still there.

7772
04:00:50,460 --> 04:00:51,460
Okay.

7773
04:00:51,460 --> 04:00:53,460
And I created a few groups of my own, you know,

7774
04:00:53,460 --> 04:00:55,460
up to a Deutsche Bank group.

7775
04:00:55,460 --> 04:00:56,460
It's generally like a Luke Harding

7776
04:00:56,460 --> 04:00:58,460
and much other journalists.

7777
04:00:58,460 --> 04:01:00,460
Oh, and every...

7778
04:01:00,460 --> 04:01:01,460
there's every...

7779
04:01:01,460 --> 04:01:03,460
once in a while, there's like a fun star chamber

7780
04:01:03,460 --> 04:01:06,460
where you get someone and everyone's going to stop at

7781
04:01:06,460 --> 04:01:09,460
and we put them in a group, you know, and we just sort of tap.

7782
04:01:09,460 --> 04:01:11,460
You know, see what they say.

7783
04:01:11,460 --> 04:01:12,460
Yeah.

7784
04:01:12,460 --> 04:01:14,460
Well, like Louise Matt, she put her in a group

7785
04:01:14,460 --> 04:01:16,460
and he started, you know, what the fuck are you doing?

7786
04:01:16,460 --> 04:01:18,460
Why did you say this about Scott's father?

7787
04:01:18,460 --> 04:01:19,460
Scott's father is a cop.

7788
04:01:19,460 --> 04:01:20,460
Oh.

7789
04:01:20,460 --> 04:01:21,460
She doxxed me.

7790
04:01:21,460 --> 04:01:22,460
Oh.

7791
04:01:22,460 --> 04:01:23,460
What the fuck are you doing?

7792
04:01:23,460 --> 04:01:24,460
Why are you going after his father?

7793
04:01:24,460 --> 04:01:26,460
You know, he's like, well, he's a Russian spy.

7794
04:01:26,460 --> 04:01:27,460
You know, you're just fucking crazy.

7795
04:01:27,460 --> 04:01:29,460
Do you understand what you're fucking doing?

7796
04:01:29,460 --> 04:01:30,460
That's weird.

7797
04:01:30,460 --> 04:01:31,460
Yeah.

7798
04:01:31,460 --> 04:01:32,460
I think...

7799
04:01:32,460 --> 04:01:34,460
Like, David Adderidge was supposed to be in one

7800
04:01:34,460 --> 04:01:37,460
group for COVID, the next guy.

7801
04:01:37,460 --> 04:01:38,460
It was a prize.

7802
04:01:38,460 --> 04:01:40,460
It was a present for me.

7803
04:01:40,460 --> 04:01:43,460
It's like a little beat down room.

7804
04:01:43,460 --> 04:01:44,460
Yeah.

7805
04:01:44,460 --> 04:01:45,460
That's weird.

7806
04:01:45,460 --> 04:01:47,460
Hey, what are you talking about?

7807
04:01:47,460 --> 04:01:48,460
What are you talking about?

7808
04:01:48,460 --> 04:01:49,460
I'm talking about you.

7809
04:01:49,460 --> 04:01:50,460
What?

7810
04:01:50,460 --> 04:01:51,460
Cool.

7811
04:01:51,460 --> 04:01:53,460
Anything else that I missed?

7812
04:01:53,460 --> 04:01:55,460
Anything else that you think that...

7813
04:01:55,460 --> 04:01:56,460
Yes.

7814
04:01:56,460 --> 04:01:57,460
I'm just...

7815
04:01:57,460 --> 04:01:58,460
I can't remember all I have.

7816
04:01:58,460 --> 04:01:59,460
Yeah, sure.

7817
04:01:59,460 --> 04:02:01,460
But it's the eyes of me.

7818
04:02:01,460 --> 04:02:03,460
If I remember...

7819
04:02:03,460 --> 04:02:05,460
I just...

7820
04:02:05,460 --> 04:02:07,460
I will remember it.

7821
04:02:07,460 --> 04:02:09,460
I have to be in a mindset.

7822
04:02:09,460 --> 04:02:10,460
Sure.

7823
04:02:10,460 --> 04:02:12,460
You know, I mean, like...

7824
04:02:12,460 --> 04:02:14,460
your memory is...

7825
04:02:14,460 --> 04:02:15,460
Yeah.

7826
04:02:16,460 --> 04:02:18,460
Yeah, I was going to ask you about something very specific.

7827
04:02:18,460 --> 04:02:20,460
You could recall more about them.

7828
04:02:20,460 --> 04:02:21,460
Tell me everything you know about everything.

7829
04:02:21,460 --> 04:02:23,460
And right now, I'm like a...

7830
04:02:23,460 --> 04:02:24,460
I'm not even active anymore.

7831
04:02:24,460 --> 04:02:26,460
I'm meeting stuff right now from my memory

7832
04:02:26,460 --> 04:02:27,460
because I'm in this room.

7833
04:02:27,460 --> 04:02:28,460
And I'm a little bit nervous.

7834
04:02:28,460 --> 04:02:29,460
I'm a bit not nervous.

7835
04:02:29,460 --> 04:02:31,460
So my brain is adapted to that point.

7836
04:02:31,460 --> 04:02:33,460
So as soon as I walk out of the room,

7837
04:02:33,460 --> 04:02:34,460
I'm like, oh, we're going to say that.

7838
04:02:34,460 --> 04:02:35,460
Yeah, yeah.

7839
04:02:35,460 --> 04:02:36,460
You know what I mean?

7840
04:02:36,460 --> 04:02:37,460
Okay.

7841
04:02:37,460 --> 04:02:38,460
So...

7842
04:02:38,460 --> 04:02:39,460
Okay.

7843
04:02:39,460 --> 04:02:40,460
Anything else that...

7844
04:02:40,460 --> 04:02:41,460
Oh, in turn?

7845
04:02:41,460 --> 04:02:42,460
Yeah.

7846
04:02:42,460 --> 04:02:43,460
Okay.

7847
04:02:43,460 --> 04:02:44,460
Well, you saw my number so quick.

7848
04:02:44,460 --> 04:02:46,460
Do you think of something that...

7849
04:02:46,460 --> 04:02:48,460
you think would be interested in, you know...

7850
04:02:48,460 --> 04:02:49,460
surely you can always let me know

7851
04:02:49,460 --> 04:02:50,460
and I can find a home for it.

7852
04:02:50,460 --> 04:02:51,460
You think?

7853
04:02:51,460 --> 04:02:53,460
And do you mean to prosecute?

7854
04:02:53,460 --> 04:02:54,460
Do you mean to go after it?

7855
04:02:54,460 --> 04:02:57,460
Do you mean to like to read that is...

7856
04:02:57,460 --> 04:02:58,460
that needs to be stopped?

7857
04:02:58,460 --> 04:02:59,460
Or would you say it's like,

7858
04:02:59,460 --> 04:03:02,460
oh, there's some fun just in hacks happening?

7859
04:03:02,460 --> 04:03:03,460
What do you mean?

7860
04:03:03,460 --> 04:03:05,460
I mean, all those things are...

7861
04:03:05,460 --> 04:03:08,460
I work a very narrow spectrum, right?

7862
04:03:08,460 --> 04:03:09,460
I work cyber-friendly.

7863
04:03:09,460 --> 04:03:10,460
Okay.

7864
04:03:10,460 --> 04:03:11,460
But there's...

7865
04:03:11,460 --> 04:03:12,460
You're a fraud, though.

7866
04:03:12,460 --> 04:03:13,460
Yeah.

7867
04:03:13,460 --> 04:03:15,460
But there's also like counter-terrorism

7868
04:03:15,460 --> 04:03:16,460
or white collar crimes

7869
04:03:16,460 --> 04:03:18,460
or practicing as some children

7870
04:03:18,460 --> 04:03:20,460
in national security threats.

7871
04:03:20,460 --> 04:03:22,460
Oh, there's a couple lawyers.

7872
04:03:22,460 --> 04:03:23,460
Okay.

7873
04:03:23,460 --> 04:03:24,460
So I get...

7874
04:03:24,460 --> 04:03:25,460
There's people that call...

7875
04:03:25,460 --> 04:03:27,460
they claim to be lawyers.

7876
04:03:27,460 --> 04:03:28,460
Okay.

7877
04:03:28,460 --> 04:03:30,460
And they ask me to do a bunch of stuff.

7878
04:03:30,460 --> 04:03:32,460
First they'll have to do very strange data

7879
04:03:32,460 --> 04:03:34,460
and then they say they're fighting and doing a lawsuit

7880
04:03:34,460 --> 04:03:36,460
against like Iran or something like that

7881
04:03:36,460 --> 04:03:39,460
on behalf of the veterans.

7882
04:03:39,460 --> 04:03:41,460
They have to go collect data for them.

7883
04:03:41,460 --> 04:03:43,460
And it's mostly just...

7884
04:03:43,460 --> 04:03:45,460
I don't know why they're asking.

7885
04:03:45,460 --> 04:03:47,460
I thought it was some spy.

7886
04:03:47,460 --> 04:03:49,460
Oh, like you think they were asking...

7887
04:03:49,460 --> 04:03:51,460
when they collect data,

7888
04:03:51,460 --> 04:03:53,460
you think it was one of the most...

7889
04:03:53,460 --> 04:03:54,460
Yeah.

7890
04:03:54,460 --> 04:03:56,460
They're asking you to have it.

7891
04:03:56,460 --> 04:03:59,460
And I know these two guys out of DC...

7892
04:03:59,460 --> 04:04:01,460
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7893
04:04:01,460 --> 04:04:02,460
They...

7894
04:04:02,460 --> 04:04:03,460
I told them to go fuck off,

7895
04:04:03,460 --> 04:04:04,460
but they did fly out here.

7896
04:04:04,460 --> 04:04:05,460
Yeah.

7897
04:04:05,460 --> 04:04:07,460
I mean, they had their e-mail accounts.

7898
04:04:07,460 --> 04:04:08,460
Yeah, no.

7899
04:04:08,460 --> 04:04:10,460
Iran, do you mind if I do that for you?

7900
04:04:10,460 --> 04:04:11,460
Sure.

7901
04:04:11,460 --> 04:04:12,460
Because they're...

7902
04:04:12,460 --> 04:04:13,460
there's something about them that's very off.

7903
04:04:13,460 --> 04:04:15,460
They flew all the way out here from DC

7904
04:04:15,460 --> 04:04:18,460
and then there was a very weird fucking...

7905
04:04:18,460 --> 04:04:19,460
there was a weird experience

7906
04:04:19,460 --> 04:04:20,460
what happened after that.

7907
04:04:20,460 --> 04:04:21,460
Oh, I thought it was true.

7908
04:04:21,460 --> 04:04:22,460
Yeah.

7909
04:04:22,460 --> 04:04:25,460
You did this to hack into Iran?

7910
04:04:25,460 --> 04:04:28,460
No, no, they wanted...

7911
04:04:28,460 --> 04:04:30,460
wire information about money being sent

7912
04:04:30,460 --> 04:04:33,460
from anywhere, any bank to Iran

7913
04:04:33,460 --> 04:04:36,460
during 2009.

7914
04:04:36,460 --> 04:04:38,460
It was just during the Gulf War, please.

7915
04:04:38,460 --> 04:04:39,460
Okay.

7916
04:04:39,460 --> 04:04:42,460
Well, it actually included Iran in 2010 as well.

7917
04:04:42,460 --> 04:04:43,460
Okay.

7918
04:04:43,460 --> 04:04:44,460
I'll...

7919
04:04:44,460 --> 04:04:46,460
I'll e-mail you and do one.

7920
04:04:46,460 --> 04:04:47,460
But, um...

7921
04:04:47,460 --> 04:04:49,460
So the plan right now is...

7922
04:04:49,460 --> 04:04:50,460
I know a Russian guy.

7923
04:04:50,460 --> 04:04:52,460
He works through it, let's say.

7924
04:04:52,460 --> 04:04:53,460
That must be...

7925
04:04:53,460 --> 04:04:54,460
Yeah.

7926
04:04:54,460 --> 04:04:55,460
Or he used to work for us.

7927
04:04:55,460 --> 04:04:56,460
Okay.

7928
04:04:56,460 --> 04:04:58,460
And he really wants to be an American.

7929
04:04:58,460 --> 04:05:00,460
So he can be of very...

7930
04:05:00,460 --> 04:05:02,460
very useful guy to you.

7931
04:05:02,460 --> 04:05:03,460
What do you think?

7932
04:05:03,460 --> 04:05:04,460
Me too.

7933
04:05:04,460 --> 04:05:05,460
Me too?

7934
04:05:05,460 --> 04:05:06,460
Yeah.

7935
04:05:06,460 --> 04:05:08,460
But be careful, because, like, you know,

7936
04:05:08,460 --> 04:05:09,460
he's being monitored.

7937
04:05:09,460 --> 04:05:10,460
Mm-hmm.

7938
04:05:10,460 --> 04:05:11,460
So, uh...

7939
04:05:11,460 --> 04:05:13,460
you know, a person died.

7940
04:05:13,460 --> 04:05:14,460
I did not want to...

7941
04:05:14,460 --> 04:05:15,460
he was a good guy.

7942
04:05:15,460 --> 04:05:16,460
He was a good guy.

7943
04:05:16,460 --> 04:05:17,460
Or is he good?

7944
04:05:17,460 --> 04:05:18,460
Yeah.

7945
04:05:18,460 --> 04:05:19,460
He's traveling all over the world.

7946
04:05:19,460 --> 04:05:20,460
He doesn't have to go back to Russia.

7947
04:05:20,460 --> 04:05:21,460
He keeps being...

7948
04:05:21,460 --> 04:05:22,460
getting...

7949
04:05:22,460 --> 04:05:23,460
He's accepted.

7950
04:05:23,460 --> 04:05:25,460
So he doesn't have to go back.

7951
04:05:25,460 --> 04:05:27,460
And he keeps trying to, you know,

7952
04:05:27,460 --> 04:05:29,460
ask me all, like,

7953
04:05:29,460 --> 04:05:31,460
is there a way or a business?

7954
04:05:31,460 --> 04:05:32,460
Can you introduce me to someone?

7955
04:05:32,460 --> 04:05:33,460
So, like, Bali...

7956
04:05:33,460 --> 04:05:35,460
He's a really good coder.

7957
04:05:35,460 --> 04:05:36,460
I don't know.

7958
04:05:36,460 --> 04:05:37,460
He's a good kind of guy.

7959
04:05:37,460 --> 04:05:38,460
But, yeah.

7960
04:05:38,460 --> 04:05:39,460
Uh, that would be very helpful for you,

7961
04:05:39,460 --> 04:05:40,460
because he does know a lot.

7962
04:05:40,460 --> 04:05:41,460
Well, how do you...

7963
04:05:41,460 --> 04:05:42,460
How do you know me?

7964
04:05:42,460 --> 04:05:43,460
I'm just gonna...

7965
04:05:43,460 --> 04:05:44,460
Uh-huh, traveling.

7966
04:05:44,460 --> 04:05:45,460
Yeah.

7967
04:05:45,460 --> 04:05:46,460
Yeah.

7968
04:05:46,460 --> 04:05:47,460
He's a girlfriend.

7969
04:05:47,460 --> 04:05:48,460
A girlfriend is the daughter

7970
04:05:48,460 --> 04:05:50,460
of a military general.

7971
04:05:50,460 --> 04:05:51,460
That's why.

7972
04:05:51,460 --> 04:05:52,460
Very interesting.

7973
04:05:52,460 --> 04:05:54,460
Um, I think he was the...

7974
04:05:54,460 --> 04:05:55,460
he was a...

7975
04:05:55,460 --> 04:05:58,460
he was tired of making military journals.

7976
04:05:58,460 --> 04:05:59,460
He came to...

7977
04:05:59,460 --> 04:06:01,460
We don't have this position in America,

7978
04:06:01,460 --> 04:06:02,460
but it's like a...

7979
04:06:02,460 --> 04:06:04,460
a nice speaker at the house.

7980
04:06:04,460 --> 04:06:05,460
It's like a...

7981
04:06:05,460 --> 04:06:07,460
It's not a attorney general,

7982
04:06:07,460 --> 04:06:10,460
but somewhere along the lines of a attorney general.

7983
04:06:10,460 --> 04:06:12,460
Um, he's got...

7984
04:06:12,460 --> 04:06:13,460
Yeah.

7985
04:06:13,460 --> 04:06:15,460
That would be a very interesting theme.

7986
04:06:15,460 --> 04:06:16,460
Yeah.

7987
04:06:16,460 --> 04:06:17,460
I mean, and like I said,

7988
04:06:17,460 --> 04:06:18,460
a lot of these things,

7989
04:06:18,460 --> 04:06:19,460
I won't work.

7990
04:06:19,460 --> 04:06:20,460
So, like, well,

7991
04:06:20,460 --> 04:06:21,460
there's, I'll take the information,

7992
04:06:21,460 --> 04:06:22,460
I'll give it to someone else,

7993
04:06:22,460 --> 04:06:23,460
and see if they want to pursue it,

7994
04:06:23,460 --> 04:06:24,460
and they'll probably talk to yours

7995
04:06:24,460 --> 04:06:25,460
and the like that.

7996
04:06:25,460 --> 04:06:26,460
Okay.

7997
04:06:26,460 --> 04:06:27,460
Okay.

7998
04:06:27,460 --> 04:06:28,460
Anyway, that's all good stuff.

7999
04:06:28,460 --> 04:06:30,460
Um, I'd like to do...

8000
04:06:30,460 --> 04:06:31,460
You can install my number

8001
04:06:31,460 --> 04:06:32,460
so you can always, you know,

8002
04:06:32,460 --> 04:06:33,460
reach out to me

8003
04:06:33,460 --> 04:06:34,460
if you forget something or...

8004
04:06:34,460 --> 04:06:35,460
Sure.

8005
04:06:35,460 --> 04:06:36,460
You know, think of something later.

8006
04:06:36,460 --> 04:06:37,460
Um...

8007
04:06:37,460 --> 04:06:38,460
Where does Marla go?

8008
04:06:38,460 --> 04:06:39,460
Yeah.

8009
04:06:39,460 --> 04:06:40,460
So, as far as Marla goes,

8010
04:06:40,460 --> 04:06:41,460
like I said, I think

8011
04:06:41,460 --> 04:06:43,460
our primary goal will still be to

8012
04:06:43,460 --> 04:06:44,460
make sure you look good

8013
04:06:44,460 --> 04:06:45,460
for the investigation.

8014
04:06:45,460 --> 04:06:46,460
Right?

8015
04:06:46,460 --> 04:06:47,460
Um...

8016
04:06:47,460 --> 04:06:48,460
But I can look good.

8017
04:06:48,460 --> 04:06:49,460
I don't know what you mean.

8018
04:06:49,460 --> 04:06:50,460
Like, just make sure

8019
04:06:50,460 --> 04:06:51,460
that the investigator sees

8020
04:06:51,460 --> 04:06:52,460
everything that he or she

8021
04:06:52,460 --> 04:06:53,460
is supposed to see,

8022
04:06:53,460 --> 04:06:55,460
as far as making you

8023
04:06:55,460 --> 04:06:56,460
and Marla, you know,

8024
04:06:56,460 --> 04:06:57,460
good parents,

8025
04:06:57,460 --> 04:06:58,460
and super, uh,

8026
04:06:58,460 --> 04:06:59,460
an adult.

8027
04:06:59,460 --> 04:07:00,460
But my worry, though,

8028
04:07:00,460 --> 04:07:01,460
is that it's already

8029
04:07:01,460 --> 04:07:02,460
it's back again

8030
04:07:02,460 --> 04:07:03,460
just purposely.

8031
04:07:03,460 --> 04:07:04,460
I don't know why.

8032
04:07:04,460 --> 04:07:05,460
Again, I just feel like

8033
04:07:05,460 --> 04:07:06,460
you did it,

8034
04:07:06,460 --> 04:07:07,460
and take the time in it.

8035
04:07:07,460 --> 04:07:09,460
Um, so even if we do show

8036
04:07:09,460 --> 04:07:10,460
our best stage

8037
04:07:10,460 --> 04:07:11,460
and we're the most perfect people

8038
04:07:11,460 --> 04:07:12,460
in the world,

8039
04:07:12,460 --> 04:07:13,460
you'll see it.

8040
04:07:13,460 --> 04:07:14,460
When you read the report,

8041
04:07:14,460 --> 04:07:15,460
you'll see what they did.

8042
04:07:15,460 --> 04:07:18,460
And now it can be...

8043
04:07:18,460 --> 04:07:19,460
I don't know how to fight that,

8044
04:07:19,460 --> 04:07:20,460
but it's something I don't know.

8045
04:07:20,460 --> 04:07:22,460
It's tough not to crack, too,

8046
04:07:22,460 --> 04:07:23,460
because, like I said,

8047
04:07:23,460 --> 04:07:24,460
I mean,

8048
04:07:24,460 --> 04:07:26,460
what would you suggest

8049
04:07:26,460 --> 04:07:27,460
that we do to influence

8050
04:07:27,460 --> 04:07:29,460
what's already been written

8051
04:07:29,460 --> 04:07:30,460
or how the proceedings

8052
04:07:30,460 --> 04:07:32,460
will go on from here?

8053
04:07:32,460 --> 04:07:34,460
Well, I had, you know,

8054
04:07:34,460 --> 04:07:35,460
my advantage,

8055
04:07:35,460 --> 04:07:36,460
uh,

8056
04:07:36,460 --> 04:07:37,460
fucking thing dismissed

8057
04:07:37,460 --> 04:07:39,460
based on their terrible, uh,

8058
04:07:39,460 --> 04:07:40,460
obviously,

8059
04:07:40,460 --> 04:07:41,460
no deep process

8060
04:07:41,460 --> 04:07:42,460
and misjudgment.

8061
04:07:42,460 --> 04:07:43,460
I wrote down a list

8062
04:07:43,460 --> 04:07:44,460
for reaction.

8063
04:07:44,460 --> 04:07:45,460
Um,

8064
04:07:45,460 --> 04:07:46,460
the lies

8065
04:07:46,460 --> 04:07:47,460
are caught in camera.

8066
04:07:47,460 --> 04:07:48,460
Right.

8067
04:07:48,460 --> 04:07:49,460
Versus what they wrote

8068
04:07:49,460 --> 04:07:50,460
in the report.

8069
04:07:50,460 --> 04:07:51,460
And it'll be good

8070
04:07:51,460 --> 04:07:52,460
if you can collect all the evidence

8071
04:07:52,460 --> 04:07:53,460
so that you can show that

8072
04:07:53,460 --> 04:07:54,460
to the judge or whomever.

8073
04:07:54,460 --> 04:07:55,460
Like,

8074
04:07:55,460 --> 04:07:56,460
I assume you're going to fire...

8075
04:07:56,460 --> 04:07:57,460
You fired your attorney

8076
04:07:57,460 --> 04:07:58,460
to hire a new one.

8077
04:07:58,460 --> 04:07:59,460
Like,

8078
04:07:59,460 --> 04:08:00,460
you know,

8079
04:08:00,460 --> 04:08:01,460
because it's probably good

8080
04:08:01,460 --> 04:08:02,460
to get an attorney.

8081
04:08:02,460 --> 04:08:03,460
Because that was another thing

8082
04:08:03,460 --> 04:08:04,460
I wanted to gauge

8083
04:08:04,460 --> 04:08:05,460
what you could do

8084
04:08:05,460 --> 04:08:06,460
and do we need an attorney

8085
04:08:06,460 --> 04:08:07,460
based on what you could do?

8086
04:08:07,460 --> 04:08:08,460
I mean,

8087
04:08:08,460 --> 04:08:09,460
just my personal thing,

8088
04:08:09,460 --> 04:08:10,460
I would probably want an attorney

8089
04:08:10,460 --> 04:08:11,460
based on what I was in your situation.

8090
04:08:11,460 --> 04:08:12,460
And I just, you know,

8091
04:08:12,460 --> 04:08:13,460
this is why people make money

8092
04:08:13,460 --> 04:08:14,460
and you can see it in color.

8093
04:08:14,460 --> 04:08:15,460
Right.

8094
04:08:15,460 --> 04:08:16,460
And like,

8095
04:08:16,460 --> 04:08:17,460
yeah,

8096
04:08:17,460 --> 04:08:18,460
and if this is completely not

8097
04:08:18,460 --> 04:08:19,460
F.D.I.

8098
04:08:19,460 --> 04:08:20,460
but just having friends

8099
04:08:20,460 --> 04:08:21,460
that have gone through the work

8100
04:08:21,460 --> 04:08:22,460
that you want to have a lawyer.

8101
04:08:22,460 --> 04:08:23,460
Yeah.

8102
04:08:23,460 --> 04:08:24,460
I mean,

8103
04:08:24,460 --> 04:08:25,460
you know,

8104
04:08:25,460 --> 04:08:26,460
where you can have a lawyer

8105
04:08:26,460 --> 04:08:27,460
and an attorney.

8106
04:08:27,460 --> 04:08:28,460
You can retell me that

8107
04:08:28,460 --> 04:08:29,460
if you want me to be your lawyer.

8108
04:08:29,460 --> 04:08:30,460
I swear to God,

8109
04:08:30,460 --> 04:08:31,460
you said that.

8110
04:08:31,460 --> 04:08:32,460
I mean,

8111
04:08:32,460 --> 04:08:33,460
I love you very much.

8112
04:08:33,460 --> 04:08:34,460
Yeah.

8113
04:08:34,460 --> 04:08:35,460
It's good that you trust

8114
04:08:35,460 --> 04:08:36,460
you that much.

8115
04:08:36,460 --> 04:08:37,460
I've been...

8116
04:08:37,460 --> 04:08:38,460
Oh, no,

8117
04:08:38,460 --> 04:08:39,460
it's not good.

8118
04:08:39,460 --> 04:08:40,460
I'm just saying that

8119
04:08:40,460 --> 04:08:41,460
a lawyer can represent himself

8120
04:08:41,460 --> 04:08:42,460
as a cool friend.

8121
04:08:42,460 --> 04:08:43,460
I said,

8122
04:08:43,460 --> 04:08:44,460
if you're representing yourself

8123
04:08:44,460 --> 04:08:45,460
in America,

8124
04:08:45,460 --> 04:08:46,460
you're going to laugh at

8125
04:08:46,460 --> 04:08:47,460
the crazy breaking,

8126
04:08:47,460 --> 04:08:48,460
okay?

8127
04:08:48,460 --> 04:08:49,460
And if the boyfriend

8128
04:08:49,460 --> 04:08:50,460
represents the girlfriend,

8129
04:08:50,460 --> 04:08:51,460
you can work,

8130
04:08:51,460 --> 04:08:52,460
right?

8131
04:08:52,460 --> 04:08:53,460
And maybe this will also

8132
04:08:53,460 --> 04:08:54,460
help the young

8133
04:08:54,460 --> 04:08:55,460
and the vulnerable.

8134
04:08:55,460 --> 04:08:56,460
Okay.

8135
04:08:56,460 --> 04:08:59,460
And the court is a lot,

8136
04:08:59,460 --> 04:09:00,460
a lot,

8137
04:09:00,460 --> 04:09:01,460
a lot of emotions,

8138
04:09:01,460 --> 04:09:02,460
right?

8139
04:09:02,460 --> 04:09:03,460
Always remember

8140
04:09:03,460 --> 04:09:04,460
that the judge

8141
04:09:04,460 --> 04:09:05,460
cares about nothing

8142
04:09:05,460 --> 04:09:07,460
except for the case.

8143
04:09:07,460 --> 04:09:08,460
Is it true, though?

8144
04:09:08,460 --> 04:09:09,460
Absolutely.

8145
04:09:09,460 --> 04:09:11,460
And think about it.

8146
04:09:11,460 --> 04:09:12,460
Think about it

8147
04:09:12,460 --> 04:09:14,460
from this perspective.

8148
04:09:14,460 --> 04:09:15,460
Their whole purpose

8149
04:09:15,460 --> 04:09:16,460
for existing

8150
04:09:16,460 --> 04:09:17,460
is to ensure

8151
04:09:17,460 --> 04:09:18,460
the safety of children.

8152
04:09:18,460 --> 04:09:19,460
That's what I want to

8153
04:09:19,460 --> 04:09:20,460
believe is true,

8154
04:09:20,460 --> 04:09:21,460
but that's not what I've seen.

8155
04:09:21,460 --> 04:09:22,460
I've seen only

8156
04:09:22,460 --> 04:09:23,460
people acting their

8157
04:09:23,460 --> 04:09:24,460
own self-interest.

8158
04:09:24,460 --> 04:09:25,460
I haven't seen anything

8159
04:09:25,460 --> 04:09:26,460
else like that

8160
04:09:26,460 --> 04:09:27,460
in this system.

8161
04:09:27,460 --> 04:09:28,460
Well,

8162
04:09:28,460 --> 04:09:29,460
when you talk about

8163
04:09:29,460 --> 04:09:30,460
the lack of

8164
04:09:30,460 --> 04:09:31,460
deep process in it,

8165
04:09:31,460 --> 04:09:32,460
something,

8166
04:09:32,460 --> 04:09:33,460
maybe some things are falling

8167
04:09:33,460 --> 04:09:34,460
apart here,

8168
04:09:34,460 --> 04:09:35,460
always come back

8169
04:09:35,460 --> 04:09:36,460
to what the judge

8170
04:09:36,460 --> 04:09:38,460
is going to ask

8171
04:09:38,460 --> 04:09:40,460
and answer those questions

8172
04:09:40,460 --> 04:09:41,460
for him.

8173
04:09:41,460 --> 04:09:43,460
Does that make sense?

8174
04:09:43,460 --> 04:09:45,460
Because one side is going to

8175
04:09:45,460 --> 04:09:46,460
say,

8176
04:09:46,460 --> 04:09:47,460
oh, this is best for the kids.

8177
04:09:47,460 --> 04:09:48,460
And your argument says,

8178
04:09:48,460 --> 04:09:49,460
this has to be

8179
04:09:49,460 --> 04:09:50,460
best for the kids.

8180
04:09:50,460 --> 04:09:51,460
That's what we're talking

8181
04:09:51,460 --> 04:09:52,460
about.

8182
04:09:52,460 --> 04:09:53,460
We got to make you

8183
04:09:53,460 --> 04:09:54,460
look better.

8184
04:09:54,460 --> 04:09:55,460
And you've got to make

8185
04:09:55,460 --> 04:09:56,460
yourself look better

8186
04:09:56,460 --> 04:09:57,460
than there's nothing

8187
04:09:57,460 --> 04:09:58,460
left.

8188
04:09:58,460 --> 04:09:59,460
Because then the judge

8189
04:09:59,460 --> 04:10:00,460
is going to wait until

8190
04:10:00,460 --> 04:10:01,460
and say,

8191
04:10:01,460 --> 04:10:02,460
this is a better place.

8192
04:10:02,460 --> 04:10:03,460
Was in the experience

8193
04:10:03,460 --> 04:10:04,460
judged like,

8194
04:10:04,460 --> 04:10:05,460
I heard

8195
04:10:05,460 --> 04:10:06,460
Dominion is to

8196
04:10:06,460 --> 04:10:07,460
know the difference

8197
04:10:07,460 --> 04:10:08,460
between the lies

8198
04:10:08,460 --> 04:10:09,460
and the fabrications.

8199
04:10:09,460 --> 04:10:10,460
To know the difference

8200
04:10:10,460 --> 04:10:11,460
between a crazy person

8201
04:10:11,460 --> 04:10:12,460
that's just calling

8202
04:10:12,460 --> 04:10:13,460
every day to

8203
04:10:13,460 --> 04:10:14,460
facility off

8204
04:10:14,460 --> 04:10:15,460
versus a person

8205
04:10:15,460 --> 04:10:16,460
that's concerned.

8206
04:10:16,460 --> 04:10:17,460
And how does the judge

8207
04:10:17,460 --> 04:10:18,460
weigh that

8208
04:10:18,460 --> 04:10:19,460
in front of them?

8209
04:10:19,460 --> 04:10:20,460
To weigh that with

8210
04:10:20,460 --> 04:10:21,460
what the judge

8211
04:10:21,460 --> 04:10:22,460
needed to lay it out

8212
04:10:22,460 --> 04:10:23,460
in front of them?

8213
04:10:23,460 --> 04:10:24,460
What's the

8214
04:10:24,460 --> 04:10:25,460
best kind of evidence

8215
04:10:25,460 --> 04:10:26,460
in front of them?

8216
04:10:26,460 --> 04:10:27,460
OK.

8217
04:10:27,460 --> 04:10:28,460
So you need

8218
04:10:28,460 --> 04:10:29,460
to, like,

8219
04:10:29,460 --> 04:10:30,460
get strong

8220
04:10:30,460 --> 04:10:31,460
and, again,

8221
04:10:31,460 --> 04:10:32,460
you know,

8222
04:10:32,460 --> 04:10:33,460
those are the lawyers

8223
04:10:33,460 --> 04:10:34,460
who, like,

8224
04:10:34,460 --> 04:10:35,460
you need to

8225
04:10:35,460 --> 04:10:36,460
try to organize

8226
04:10:36,460 --> 04:10:37,460
your response

8227
04:10:37,460 --> 04:10:38,460
to those, like,

8228
04:10:38,460 --> 04:10:39,460
your buttocks

8229
04:10:39,460 --> 04:10:40,460
because they're

8230
04:10:40,460 --> 04:10:41,460
representing the facts

8231
04:10:41,460 --> 04:10:42,460
to the judge, not.

8232
04:10:42,460 --> 04:10:43,460
I mean, you could, too.

8233
04:10:43,460 --> 04:10:44,460
No, you're right.

8234
04:10:44,460 --> 04:10:45,460
We're going to get there.

8235
04:10:45,460 --> 04:10:46,460
Yeah, OK.

8236
04:10:46,460 --> 04:10:47,460
But thank you, yeah.

8237
04:10:47,460 --> 04:10:48,460
I'm worried because

8238
04:10:48,460 --> 04:10:49,460
I looked up this judge

8239
04:10:49,460 --> 04:10:50,460
and her reviews were

8240
04:10:50,460 --> 04:10:51,460
not good.

8241
04:10:51,460 --> 04:10:52,460
And I don't expect her

8242
04:10:52,460 --> 04:10:53,460
to have any,

8243
04:10:53,460 --> 04:10:54,460
you know,

8244
04:10:54,460 --> 04:10:55,460
these are the

8245
04:10:55,460 --> 04:10:56,460
things.

8246
04:10:56,460 --> 04:10:57,460
But this was

8247
04:10:57,460 --> 04:10:58,460
100% bad.

8248
04:10:58,460 --> 04:10:59,460
There was nothing good.

8249
04:10:59,460 --> 04:11:00,460
I guess the people that

8250
04:11:00,460 --> 04:11:01,460
put these are more

8251
04:11:01,460 --> 04:11:02,460
motivated to write this.

8252
04:11:03,460 --> 04:11:04,460
I know that, too.

8253
04:11:04,460 --> 04:11:05,460
Like, I've read

8254
04:11:05,460 --> 04:11:06,460
through the lines.

8255
04:11:06,460 --> 04:11:07,460
I've been one

8256
04:11:07,460 --> 04:11:08,460
through lots of cases,

8257
04:11:08,460 --> 04:11:09,460
but I didn't see anybody say

8258
04:11:09,460 --> 04:11:10,460
she did great by

8259
04:11:10,460 --> 04:11:11,460
not one person.

8260
04:11:11,460 --> 04:11:12,460
I only see

8261
04:11:12,460 --> 04:11:13,460
she's married to another

8262
04:11:13,460 --> 04:11:15,460
judge in that same court.

8263
04:11:15,460 --> 04:11:16,460
I see he was

8264
04:11:16,460 --> 04:11:17,460
admonished for his

8265
04:11:17,460 --> 04:11:18,460
handling of the situation.

8266
04:11:18,460 --> 04:11:19,460
She was admonished for this.

8267
04:11:19,460 --> 04:11:20,460
They were,

8268
04:11:20,460 --> 04:11:21,460
they were

8269
04:11:21,460 --> 04:11:22,460
severe.

8270
04:11:22,460 --> 04:11:23,460
Like, I'm

8271
04:11:23,460 --> 04:11:24,460
I'm

8272
04:11:24,460 --> 04:11:25,460
I was focused on

8273
04:11:25,460 --> 04:11:26,460
what's successful,

8274
04:11:26,460 --> 04:11:27,460
the people that are successful,

8275
04:11:27,460 --> 04:11:28,460
right?

8276
04:11:28,460 --> 04:11:29,460
How were they successful?

8277
04:11:29,460 --> 04:11:31,460
They presented

8278
04:11:31,460 --> 04:11:32,460
evidence that

8279
04:11:32,460 --> 04:11:33,460
was more favorable

8280
04:11:33,460 --> 04:11:34,460
for each child.

8281
04:11:34,460 --> 04:11:35,460
Oh.

8282
04:11:36,460 --> 04:11:37,460
That's it.

8283
04:11:37,460 --> 04:11:39,460
It's very narrow,

8284
04:11:39,460 --> 04:11:40,460
and it's really narrow.

8285
04:11:40,460 --> 04:11:41,460
But I do that.

8286
04:11:41,460 --> 04:11:42,460
That's why I'm here.

8287
04:11:42,460 --> 04:11:43,460
That's why I'm frustrated.

8288
04:11:43,460 --> 04:11:44,460
Because this is what

8289
04:11:44,460 --> 04:11:45,460
I do.

8290
04:11:45,460 --> 04:11:46,460
Well, that's what

8291
04:11:46,460 --> 04:11:47,460
you need to give attorney.

8292
04:11:47,460 --> 04:11:48,460
It's clear.

8293
04:11:48,460 --> 04:11:49,460
It's clear.

8294
04:11:49,460 --> 04:11:50,460
If you walk in the room,

8295
04:11:50,460 --> 04:11:51,460
if you guys walk in there,

8296
04:11:51,460 --> 04:11:52,460
anybody who's walked

8297
04:11:52,460 --> 04:11:53,460
into my life

8298
04:11:53,460 --> 04:11:55,460
and read to Steve,

8299
04:11:55,460 --> 04:11:56,460
it's night and day.

8300
04:11:56,460 --> 04:11:57,460
Obviously,

8301
04:11:57,460 --> 04:11:58,460
Marla belongs to this.

8302
04:11:58,460 --> 04:11:59,460
It's,

8303
04:11:59,460 --> 04:12:00,460
I'm not saying that this is

8304
04:12:00,460 --> 04:12:01,460
subjectively.

8305
04:12:01,460 --> 04:12:02,460
I mean, I am,

8306
04:12:02,460 --> 04:12:03,460
but it's clear.

8307
04:12:03,460 --> 04:12:04,460
But to have these

8308
04:12:04,460 --> 04:12:05,460
these people do that

8309
04:12:05,460 --> 04:12:07,460
and come up with

8310
04:12:07,460 --> 04:12:08,460
this,

8311
04:12:08,460 --> 04:12:09,460
when you read it,

8312
04:12:09,460 --> 04:12:10,460
you'll see.

8313
04:12:10,460 --> 04:12:11,460
It's,

8314
04:12:11,460 --> 04:12:12,460
that scares me

8315
04:12:12,460 --> 04:12:13,460
because that shows

8316
04:12:13,460 --> 04:12:14,460
that someone is

8317
04:12:14,460 --> 04:12:15,460
something else is going on.

8318
04:12:15,460 --> 04:12:16,460
There's something else

8319
04:12:16,460 --> 04:12:17,460
I don't know.

8320
04:12:17,460 --> 04:12:18,460
I don't know how to gauge it.

8321
04:12:18,460 --> 04:12:19,460
I don't know how to weigh it.

8322
04:12:19,460 --> 04:12:20,460
I don't know what it is

8323
04:12:20,460 --> 04:12:21,460
and scaring it.

8324
04:12:23,460 --> 04:12:24,460
It's not

8325
04:12:24,460 --> 04:12:25,460
how it should be.

8326
04:12:25,460 --> 04:12:26,460
You know,

8327
04:12:26,460 --> 04:12:27,460
it's how it should be.

8328
04:12:27,460 --> 04:12:28,460
That's the problem.

8329
04:12:28,460 --> 04:12:29,460
I held you earlier.

8330
04:12:29,460 --> 04:12:30,460
We're honest.

8331
04:12:30,460 --> 04:12:31,460
I'll be honest with you now.

8332
04:12:31,460 --> 04:12:32,460
It's just scary.

8333
04:12:32,460 --> 04:12:34,460
It's just scary things.

8334
04:12:34,460 --> 04:12:35,460
That's,

8335
04:12:35,460 --> 04:12:37,460
that's Marie's child

8336
04:12:37,460 --> 04:12:38,460
but it's also yours.

8337
04:12:38,460 --> 04:12:39,460
So,

8338
04:12:39,460 --> 04:12:41,460
you've got to focus on those things.

8339
04:12:41,460 --> 04:12:42,460
And I'll,

8340
04:12:42,460 --> 04:12:43,460
and I'll give you something.

8341
04:12:43,460 --> 04:12:44,460
I'm not going to try

8342
04:12:44,460 --> 04:12:45,460
but hearing this,

8343
04:12:45,460 --> 04:12:47,460
some of what I picked up on

8344
04:12:47,460 --> 04:12:49,460
is an allegation of a beard,

8345
04:12:49,460 --> 04:12:50,460
of a bruise.

8346
04:12:50,460 --> 04:12:51,460
Yeah.

8347
04:12:51,460 --> 04:12:52,460
A black eye.

8348
04:12:52,460 --> 04:12:53,460
Okay.

8349
04:12:53,460 --> 04:12:54,460
Don't be mad about the allegation.

8350
04:12:54,460 --> 04:12:55,460
How do you get privy?

8351
04:12:55,460 --> 04:12:56,460
I know,

8352
04:12:56,460 --> 04:12:57,460
but you can,

8353
04:12:57,460 --> 04:12:58,460
but that's why they picked the shit

8354
04:12:58,460 --> 04:12:59,460
that's hard to disprove.

8355
04:12:59,460 --> 04:13:00,460
How do I go and disprove your phone?

8356
04:13:00,460 --> 04:13:01,460
We have photos from the game.

8357
04:13:01,460 --> 04:13:02,460
Well,

8358
04:13:02,460 --> 04:13:03,460
you said you also had a video crew

8359
04:13:03,460 --> 04:13:04,460
that was following you.

8360
04:13:04,460 --> 04:13:05,460
We have a video crew

8361
04:13:05,460 --> 04:13:06,460
and we have photos of Marlon

8362
04:13:06,460 --> 04:13:07,460
from that day.

8363
04:13:07,460 --> 04:13:08,460
Okay.

8364
04:13:08,460 --> 04:13:09,460
So,

8365
04:13:09,460 --> 04:13:10,460
so then someone says,

8366
04:13:10,460 --> 04:13:11,460
oh, well,

8367
04:13:11,460 --> 04:13:12,460
you need to produce those

8368
04:13:12,460 --> 04:13:14,460
to show that that allegation is false.

8369
04:13:14,460 --> 04:13:16,460
You just have to focus on that.

8370
04:13:16,460 --> 04:13:17,460
Does that make sense?

8371
04:13:17,460 --> 04:13:18,460
That's,

8372
04:13:18,460 --> 04:13:19,460
yeah,

8373
04:13:19,460 --> 04:13:20,460
I mean,

8374
04:13:20,460 --> 04:13:21,460
like it's easy.

8375
04:13:21,460 --> 04:13:22,460
And you need to.

8376
04:13:22,460 --> 04:13:23,460
It sounds easy.

8377
04:13:23,460 --> 04:13:24,460
I can do that

8378
04:13:24,460 --> 04:13:25,460
but they can only say

8379
04:13:25,460 --> 04:13:26,460
something else.

8380
04:13:26,460 --> 04:13:27,460
How do you disprove Marlon

8381
04:13:27,460 --> 04:13:28,460
going through the trash?

8382
04:13:28,460 --> 04:13:29,460
Scouraging for food?

8383
04:13:29,460 --> 04:13:30,460
How do I disprove that?

8384
04:13:30,460 --> 04:13:31,460
At 1 a.m.,

8385
04:13:31,460 --> 04:13:32,460
she says,

8386
04:13:32,460 --> 04:13:33,460
he's going through the trash

8387
04:13:33,460 --> 04:13:34,460
alone,

8388
04:13:34,460 --> 04:13:35,460
trying to get food out of

8389
04:13:35,460 --> 04:13:36,460
garbage dumpsters.

8390
04:13:36,460 --> 04:13:37,460
Marlon,

8391
04:13:37,460 --> 04:13:38,460
an eight-year-old.

8392
04:13:38,460 --> 04:13:39,460
How do I disprove that?

8393
04:13:39,460 --> 04:13:40,460
And that's,

8394
04:13:40,460 --> 04:13:41,460
that's the thing.

8395
04:13:41,460 --> 04:13:42,460
You can't disprove it.

8396
04:13:42,460 --> 04:13:43,460
You can't prove a negative, right?

8397
04:13:43,460 --> 04:13:44,460
You can't disprove.

8398
04:13:44,460 --> 04:13:45,460
Go disprove it.

8399
04:13:45,460 --> 04:13:46,460
You're not,

8400
04:13:46,460 --> 04:13:47,460
tell me,

8401
04:13:47,460 --> 04:13:48,460
prove me you're not guilty.

8402
04:13:48,460 --> 04:13:49,460
A little garlet letter?

8403
04:13:49,460 --> 04:13:50,460
Yeah.

8404
04:13:50,460 --> 04:13:51,460
Yeah.

8405
04:13:51,460 --> 04:13:52,460
That's,

8406
04:13:52,460 --> 04:13:53,460
that's,

8407
04:13:53,460 --> 04:13:54,460
that's,

8408
04:13:54,460 --> 04:13:55,460
that's what I'm trying to say.

8409
04:13:55,460 --> 04:13:56,460
I'm trying to go to the

8410
04:13:56,460 --> 04:13:57,460
top of these lawyers.

8411
04:13:57,460 --> 04:13:58,460
Like,

8412
04:13:58,460 --> 04:13:59,460
they've seen it all.

8413
04:13:59,460 --> 04:14:00,460
They've seen,

8414
04:14:00,460 --> 04:14:01,460
you know,

8415
04:14:01,460 --> 04:14:02,460
they've probably seen

8416
04:14:02,460 --> 04:14:03,460
elements of your story before

8417
04:14:03,460 --> 04:14:04,460
and they know what,

8418
04:14:04,460 --> 04:14:05,460
they hopefully they will know

8419
04:14:05,460 --> 04:14:08,460
what a good response to those

8420
04:14:08,460 --> 04:14:09,460
things are.

8421
04:14:09,460 --> 04:14:10,460
And another thing,

8422
04:14:10,460 --> 04:14:11,460
it's not just being a good,

8423
04:14:11,460 --> 04:14:12,460
like,

8424
04:14:12,460 --> 04:14:13,460
you can be a vicious,

8425
04:14:13,460 --> 04:14:14,460
hard-going lawyer,

8426
04:14:14,460 --> 04:14:15,460
but if you don't understand

8427
04:14:15,460 --> 04:14:16,460
and you don't understand

8428
04:14:16,460 --> 04:14:17,460
the process,

8429
04:14:17,460 --> 04:14:18,460
how are you going to be

8430
04:14:18,460 --> 04:14:19,460
at the other side,

8431
04:14:19,460 --> 04:14:20,460
whether you want or not?

8432
04:14:20,460 --> 04:14:21,460
Yes.

8433
04:14:21,460 --> 04:14:22,460
You have to understand

8434
04:14:22,460 --> 04:14:22,960
Yes.

8435
04:14:22,960 --> 04:14:24,960
You have to understand your situation.

8436
04:14:24,960 --> 04:14:25,460
We don't.

8437
04:14:25,460 --> 04:14:25,960
We don't.

8438
04:14:25,960 --> 04:14:26,960
He didn't tell us anything.

8439
04:14:26,960 --> 04:14:29,960
He didn't want that job to be done.

8440
04:14:29,960 --> 04:14:31,960
He was using us for his own case.

8441
04:14:31,960 --> 04:14:33,460
Can you see that's pretty tricky?

8442
04:14:33,460 --> 04:14:36,960
I can't tell you what to do with your attorney to fire that and get a new one or what kind

8443
04:14:36,960 --> 04:14:37,460
of attorney.

8444
04:14:37,460 --> 04:14:44,460
I just can't do that because I think I'm starting to be in a certain spot as any human would

8445
04:14:44,460 --> 04:14:45,960
just do any process.

8446
04:14:45,960 --> 04:14:48,960
You have to understand the other side of it.

8447
04:14:48,960 --> 04:14:49,460
I did.

8448
04:14:49,460 --> 04:14:54,460
I'm telling you, we accidentally put ourselves in the middle of another case.

8449
04:14:54,460 --> 04:14:57,460
We're being used for someone else's case.

8450
04:14:57,460 --> 04:15:04,460
The lawyer we found, the woman that we recall, wants us to help her with her bigger case.

8451
04:15:04,460 --> 04:15:05,960
That's what we're used for.

8452
04:15:05,960 --> 04:15:08,460
So our lawyer was not working our best interest.

8453
04:15:08,460 --> 04:15:11,460
He's working for his best interest and her best interest.

8454
04:15:11,460 --> 04:15:12,460
That's the problem.

8455
04:15:12,460 --> 04:15:21,460
And that's why I'm fucking, that woman, the judge, knows that because he's been working

8456
04:15:21,460 --> 04:15:24,460
in that group for 30, 20 years.

8457
04:15:24,460 --> 04:15:25,460
Everyone knows each other.

8458
04:15:25,460 --> 04:15:26,460
It's so ancestral down there.

8459
04:15:26,460 --> 04:15:30,460
She knows that, but she's still accepted that what she did.

8460
04:15:30,460 --> 04:15:31,460
And that scares me too.

8461
04:15:31,460 --> 04:15:32,460
He's judged.

8462
04:15:32,460 --> 04:15:38,460
The whole thing used to be, you have to get paternal affairs down there and fucking clean this place up because something's wrong here.

8463
04:15:38,460 --> 04:15:40,460
And these are children.

8464
04:15:40,460 --> 04:15:41,460
It's fucked up.

8465
04:15:41,460 --> 04:15:43,460
You know, they think they're above the law now.

8466
04:15:43,460 --> 04:15:44,460
These people are down there.

8467
04:15:44,460 --> 04:15:45,460
It's fucked up.

8468
04:15:45,460 --> 04:15:46,460
The egos are so big.

8469
04:15:46,460 --> 04:15:47,460
Nope.

8470
04:15:47,460 --> 04:15:51,460
Like, I've seen big egos, like bankers, like billionaires.

8471
04:15:51,460 --> 04:15:54,460
They don't say anything against these lawyers and the judges.

8472
04:15:54,460 --> 04:15:55,460
It's crazy.

8473
04:15:55,460 --> 04:15:57,460
But we don't have your back.

8474
04:15:57,460 --> 04:15:59,460
We're going to have your case.

8475
04:15:59,460 --> 04:16:02,460
That's what I'm telling you.

8476
04:16:02,460 --> 04:16:10,460
For example, he said, clear as day in writing, I am counsel for Bob Brooksman.

8477
04:16:10,460 --> 04:16:11,460
Marie calls him last night.

8478
04:16:11,460 --> 04:16:12,460
We record the conversation.

8479
04:16:12,460 --> 04:16:13,460
He doesn't know.

8480
04:16:13,460 --> 04:16:18,460
Why didn't you say to Tim and Lucy that you were Vowell's counsel?

8481
04:16:18,460 --> 04:16:19,460
I'll fucking Vowell.

8482
04:16:19,460 --> 04:16:20,460
Don't listen to him.

8483
04:16:20,460 --> 04:16:22,460
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

8484
04:16:22,460 --> 04:16:23,460
Vowell's an idiot.

8485
04:16:23,460 --> 04:16:24,460
Vowell's a bully.

8486
04:16:24,460 --> 04:16:25,460
He's going to ruin you.

8487
04:16:25,460 --> 04:16:26,460
He's going to screw up your case.

8488
04:16:26,460 --> 04:16:27,460
You need to drop Vowell.

8489
04:16:27,460 --> 04:16:29,460
No, but you didn't answer my question.

8490
04:16:29,460 --> 04:16:31,460
How is it that you said this?

8491
04:16:31,460 --> 04:16:33,460
I mean, it's right here in the email.

8492
04:16:33,460 --> 04:16:34,460
I'm looking at it.

8493
04:16:34,460 --> 04:16:35,460
I did not say that, Marie.

8494
04:16:35,460 --> 04:16:36,460
I said, I'm your counsel.

8495
04:16:36,460 --> 04:16:37,460
I'm Marie's counsel.

8496
04:16:37,460 --> 04:16:38,460
And I'm here to help.

8497
04:16:38,460 --> 04:16:39,460
That's it.

8498
04:16:39,460 --> 04:16:40,460
You want to talk about this?

8499
04:16:40,460 --> 04:16:41,460
You want to talk about going with Vowell?

8500
04:16:41,460 --> 04:16:42,460
I can walk away anytime.

8501
04:16:42,460 --> 04:16:45,460
I don't need this case for 30 minutes of this.

8502
04:16:45,460 --> 04:16:46,460
All right.

8503
04:16:46,460 --> 04:16:48,460
He was denying reality.

8504
04:16:48,460 --> 04:16:49,460
Okay.

8505
04:16:49,460 --> 04:16:50,460
That's scary.

8506
04:16:50,460 --> 04:16:51,460
That's your attorney.

8507
04:16:51,460 --> 04:16:52,460
That was our attorney.

8508
04:16:52,460 --> 04:16:53,460
That's my attorney.

8509
04:16:53,460 --> 04:16:54,460
That's your attorney.

8510
04:16:54,460 --> 04:16:57,460
Yeah, but that's also the relationship with the judge.

8511
04:16:57,460 --> 04:16:58,460
That's what I'm saying.

8512
04:16:58,460 --> 04:17:00,460
It's like that, don't it?

8513
04:17:00,460 --> 04:17:03,460
It seems like we're correcting it from wrong.

8514
04:17:03,460 --> 04:17:06,460
Your frustration is that you believe that there's corruption at the judicial level.

8515
04:17:06,460 --> 04:17:07,460
Like the judge is corrupt.

8516
04:17:07,460 --> 04:17:08,460
Yeah.

8517
04:17:08,460 --> 04:17:09,460
That's the problem.

8518
04:17:09,460 --> 04:17:10,460
Absolutely.

8519
04:17:10,460 --> 04:17:11,460
Yeah.

8520
04:17:11,460 --> 04:17:12,460
So, yeah.

8521
04:17:12,460 --> 04:17:13,460
No experience with this at all.

8522
04:17:13,460 --> 04:17:15,460
I'm just telling you, my experience with this is where I talk.

8523
04:17:15,460 --> 04:17:19,460
Well, it's because nothing we can tell you about the process is going to make any sense

8524
04:17:19,460 --> 04:17:21,460
if you don't trust the system, right?

8525
04:17:21,460 --> 04:17:24,460
Because right now you don't trust the system because you think the judge is corrupt, right?

8526
04:17:24,460 --> 04:17:27,460
So, then the question is, what is our solution?

8527
04:17:27,460 --> 04:17:28,460
We can't just correct the problem, right?

8528
04:17:28,460 --> 04:17:29,460
That's right.

8529
04:17:29,460 --> 04:17:30,460
We have to find a solution to it.

8530
04:17:30,460 --> 04:17:33,460
And I cannot be, I can't be an asshole and just do it for myself.

8531
04:17:33,460 --> 04:17:35,460
And that's why I say, well, there's other people's children.

8532
04:17:35,460 --> 04:17:39,460
So, if I read about our mind about their kids being taken away from them, we can't...

8533
04:17:39,460 --> 04:17:40,460
Hold on.

8534
04:17:40,460 --> 04:17:41,460
Hold on.

8535
04:17:41,460 --> 04:17:42,460
Right?

8536
04:17:42,460 --> 04:17:46,460
So, like, we can talk all day with you about how to help you.

8537
04:17:46,460 --> 04:17:51,460
But if you don't trust the judge, nothing that we can say is going to make any difference, right?

8538
04:17:51,460 --> 04:17:57,460
So, as far as being a corrupt judge, like if you wanted us to investigate the judge for

8539
04:17:57,460 --> 04:18:01,460
public corruption or something like that, that's a whole other case, a whole other issue that

8540
04:18:01,460 --> 04:18:04,460
we would have to resolve that would take years.

8541
04:18:04,460 --> 04:18:06,460
It's not going to help you.

8542
04:18:06,460 --> 04:18:08,460
So, how do you navigate it?

8543
04:18:08,460 --> 04:18:09,460
Right, right.

8544
04:18:09,460 --> 04:18:14,460
So, the best advice I can give you is that, as unfair as it sounds right now, there seems

8545
04:18:14,460 --> 04:18:17,460
like there's a lot of things that are going on with the judge.

8546
04:18:17,460 --> 04:18:19,460
What we've talked about is true.

8547
04:18:19,460 --> 04:18:22,460
The judges do have a kid that interests that hand.

8548
04:18:22,460 --> 04:18:27,460
Like, you can form a whole conspiracy about why this judge wants to take Marlowe away from

8549
04:18:27,460 --> 04:18:28,460
you.

8550
04:18:28,460 --> 04:18:29,460
And it's about Marlowe.

8551
04:18:29,460 --> 04:18:32,460
And that's what we have to focus on, right?

8552
04:18:32,460 --> 04:18:36,460
Because if the judge is trying to, you know, screw someone over...

8553
04:18:36,460 --> 04:18:38,460
You're going back to the same...

8554
04:18:38,460 --> 04:18:44,460
Okay, so, what's our solution going to be for a corrupt judge that is just out to fuck

8555
04:18:44,460 --> 04:18:45,460
everyone?

8556
04:18:45,460 --> 04:18:46,460
That's not what I'm saying.

8557
04:18:46,460 --> 04:18:47,460
I'm not saying...

8558
04:18:47,460 --> 04:18:49,460
Do you know how it comes off?

8559
04:18:49,460 --> 04:18:53,460
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like that.

8560
04:18:53,460 --> 04:19:02,460
I mean, in this specific case, we accidentally found a lawyer that has an agenda to get another

8561
04:19:02,460 --> 04:19:03,460
guy, right?

8562
04:19:03,460 --> 04:19:08,460
We fell into this trap, into a circle of friends, they're like a cabal, they're very close to

8563
04:19:08,460 --> 04:19:10,460
each other, they're married to each other for fuck's sake.

8564
04:19:10,460 --> 04:19:13,460
You know each other very well for 20 plus years.

8565
04:19:13,460 --> 04:19:17,460
They feel like they're above the law, they have their own law structure there.

8566
04:19:17,460 --> 04:19:20,460
They decide what happens, not the law.

8567
04:19:20,460 --> 04:19:27,460
And we saw accidentally the triple lambing out into this little cabal and we became a

8568
04:19:27,460 --> 04:19:29,460
tool all of a sudden.

8569
04:19:29,460 --> 04:19:33,460
Now, when we drop this guy, he's not going to be happy about that.

8570
04:19:33,460 --> 04:19:35,460
He knows the judge very well.

8571
04:19:35,460 --> 04:19:37,460
Very fucking well, they're very close.

8572
04:19:37,460 --> 04:19:38,460
You can see it in the...

8573
04:19:38,460 --> 04:19:40,460
You know, they say don't record...

8574
04:19:40,460 --> 04:19:41,460
You know how they record this shit?

8575
04:19:41,460 --> 04:19:42,460
The trials?

8576
04:19:42,460 --> 04:19:44,460
They fucking record everything.

8577
04:19:44,460 --> 04:19:51,460
You know, and so we went through it last night and heard again how he did not defend us.

8578
04:19:51,460 --> 04:19:53,460
I mean, I don't want to get too much into it.

8579
04:19:53,460 --> 04:19:58,460
We actively tried to get him out of the room knowing that Murray was lying in the belt

8580
04:19:58,460 --> 04:19:59,460
under the room, don't worry about it.

8581
04:19:59,460 --> 04:20:02,460
You know Murray, you really have to get him out of the room.

8582
04:20:02,460 --> 04:20:04,460
And that's our lawyer throwing us under the bus.

8583
04:20:04,460 --> 04:20:06,460
And the judge knew it.

8584
04:20:06,460 --> 04:20:08,460
I don't know how to describe it.

8585
04:20:08,460 --> 04:20:12,460
You think if you had a new lawyer it would change the situation?

8586
04:20:12,460 --> 04:20:13,460
No.

8587
04:20:14,460 --> 04:20:17,460
But that's a solution, I think, on the table right now.

8588
04:20:17,460 --> 04:20:18,460
I don't know.

8589
04:20:18,460 --> 04:20:21,460
There might be a good guy, like a stand-up guy.

8590
04:20:21,460 --> 04:20:24,460
And he's told us it's a whole other system down there.

8591
04:20:24,460 --> 04:20:28,460
You need to get a lawyer that's court ordered that knows that system.

8592
04:20:28,460 --> 04:20:29,460
You know, that's your best bet.

8593
04:20:29,460 --> 04:20:32,460
I can get you an expensive lawyer that can do it for you, too.

8594
04:20:32,460 --> 04:20:35,460
But he's not going to be as good as the people that are in that court.

8595
04:20:35,460 --> 04:20:37,460
And that means that it is corrupt.

8596
04:20:37,460 --> 04:20:38,460
They do it amongst each other.

8597
04:20:38,460 --> 04:20:42,460
They have their own star chambers, certain things.

8598
04:20:42,460 --> 04:20:47,460
And so it's Sava who's creating fucking evidence, and she's a social worker.

8599
04:20:47,460 --> 04:20:50,460
She's supposed to have the child's best interests at heart.

8600
04:20:50,460 --> 04:20:51,460
That is her.

8601
04:20:51,460 --> 04:20:54,460
When she was hired she could pay $100,000 a year to do that.

8602
04:20:54,460 --> 04:20:56,460
And the other guy, 200,000,000.

8603
04:20:56,460 --> 04:20:58,460
They're supposed to be good at their job.

8604
04:20:58,460 --> 04:21:00,460
Comes in and starts fucking lying.

8605
04:21:00,460 --> 04:21:02,460
And changing the narrative, read it.

8606
04:21:02,460 --> 04:21:04,460
See how the narrative changed after page 15?

8607
04:21:04,460 --> 04:21:06,460
The narrative changed dramatically.

8608
04:21:06,460 --> 04:21:07,460
You'll see.

8609
04:21:07,460 --> 04:21:09,460
How do you fight that?

8610
04:21:09,460 --> 04:21:11,460
That's fucked up.

8611
04:21:12,460 --> 04:21:13,660
That's what's fucked up.

8612
04:21:13,660 --> 04:21:16,900
What I was my plan was if I am all I have options,

8613
04:21:16,900 --> 04:21:19,940
I'm going to throw it onto the group, more than three

8614
04:21:19,940 --> 04:21:21,740
of them, and say, look, this is a problem.

8615
04:21:21,740 --> 04:21:23,340
I need your help.

8616
04:21:23,340 --> 04:21:24,660
What can you do?

8617
04:21:24,660 --> 04:21:28,500
And that's done with my last, but then you got something.

8618
04:21:28,500 --> 04:21:29,000
It's good.

8619
04:21:29,000 --> 04:21:31,180
I want to get that was my other choice.

8620
04:21:31,180 --> 04:21:33,060
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

8621
04:21:33,060 --> 04:21:34,940
And it's from Marlowe, I got to go do it.

8622
04:21:34,940 --> 04:21:36,540
No, totally.

8623
04:21:36,540 --> 04:21:39,780
I mean, in a year, you said to walk away from here,

8624
04:21:39,780 --> 04:21:42,260
but look at other references for lawyers.

8625
04:21:42,260 --> 04:21:44,980
Because you always think about a dad or a friend.

8626
04:21:44,980 --> 04:21:47,540
They had their own reasons for introducing you

8627
04:21:47,540 --> 04:21:49,220
to that lawyer.

8628
04:21:49,220 --> 04:21:52,060
So if you're bowling under and hearing me, it's systemic.

8629
04:21:52,060 --> 04:21:55,740
Like, I'm not having a great, great burden in the world.

8630
04:21:55,740 --> 04:21:57,020
It wins everything.

8631
04:21:57,020 --> 04:21:59,820
But not in this world, because this world is

8632
04:21:59,820 --> 04:22:01,420
run by these people.

8633
04:22:01,420 --> 04:22:02,900
They make their own goals.

8634
04:22:02,900 --> 04:22:07,580
The law that was first followed, they create their own laws.

8635
04:22:07,580 --> 04:22:08,460
That's a problem.

8636
04:22:09,420 --> 04:22:11,180
Let's read the reader for us.

8637
04:22:11,180 --> 04:22:16,740
I think it's going back to thinking about why we're better

8638
04:22:16,740 --> 04:22:19,380
off going in with a lawyer than by yourself.

8639
04:22:19,380 --> 04:22:20,380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

8640
04:22:20,380 --> 04:22:21,860
Yeah, I agree.

8641
04:22:21,860 --> 04:22:22,860
Absolutely.

8642
04:22:22,860 --> 04:22:23,860
No, absolutely.

8643
04:22:23,860 --> 04:22:24,860
Yeah.

8644
04:22:24,860 --> 04:22:25,860
I'm going with the lawyer.

8645
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:26,860
We're fine with the lawyer.

8646
04:22:26,860 --> 04:22:29,340
The thing that we're trying to say,

8647
04:22:29,340 --> 04:22:31,660
like, here's the thing, you have to either trust

8648
04:22:31,660 --> 04:22:33,780
that what we're saying is from experience,

8649
04:22:33,780 --> 04:22:35,380
or you don't have to take our opinion.

8650
04:22:35,380 --> 04:22:37,100
I mean, it's just a opinion of three.

8651
04:22:37,860 --> 04:22:39,820
I'm just so media all the data, I just want

8652
04:22:39,820 --> 04:22:41,380
to make sure you have everything.

8653
04:22:41,380 --> 04:22:43,900
So the thing would be, if your attorney also

8654
04:22:43,900 --> 04:22:47,300
sees that there's this corrupt system where the judge is

8655
04:22:47,300 --> 04:22:49,100
in bed with everyone else, they may

8656
04:22:49,100 --> 04:22:50,220
be able to change a venue.

8657
04:22:50,220 --> 04:22:51,180
They need to do something.

8658
04:22:51,180 --> 04:22:53,260
But they would have that knowledge, right?

8659
04:22:53,260 --> 04:22:54,540
Like, I don't have it now.

8660
04:22:54,540 --> 04:22:57,180
They're not a, I don't do child custody battles,

8661
04:22:57,180 --> 04:22:59,500
but they need to be based on doubt defense, certainly.

8662
04:22:59,500 --> 04:23:00,940
A couple of different occasions.

8663
04:23:00,940 --> 04:23:03,980
But those are different situations, different judges

8664
04:23:03,980 --> 04:23:04,500
to people.

8665
04:23:04,500 --> 04:23:06,740
So whatever training you get, we'll

8666
04:23:06,740 --> 04:23:08,300
be able to look after your best interests.

8667
04:23:08,300 --> 04:23:10,180
The point would be, though, is you have to trust

8668
04:23:10,180 --> 04:23:11,740
that that attorney is going to be good,

8669
04:23:11,740 --> 04:23:13,700
and is going to be looking after your best interests.

8670
04:23:13,700 --> 04:23:15,540
So do your research, and we know we

8671
04:23:15,540 --> 04:23:18,180
can help with that, if that would be the best option.

8672
04:23:18,180 --> 04:23:19,980
But I'm trying to find a good solution for you,

8673
04:23:19,980 --> 04:23:21,740
because I don't want you to walk away from here thinking,

8674
04:23:21,740 --> 04:23:23,980
like, well, if I don't care, I do want to help you.

8675
04:23:23,980 --> 04:23:26,260
But we need to think of realistic ways we can help you.

8676
04:23:26,260 --> 04:23:27,820
And that would be the best way to do it.

8677
04:23:27,820 --> 04:23:28,820
Sorry, maybe you're right.

8678
04:23:28,820 --> 04:23:29,660
I'm just thinking.

8679
04:23:29,660 --> 04:23:31,860
So realistic way would be to play their game,

8680
04:23:31,860 --> 04:23:33,700
find out what their rules are, and play their game.

8681
04:23:33,700 --> 04:23:36,700
So that's the end of it.

8682
04:23:37,660 --> 04:23:39,540
I mean, I don't want you to be upset.

8683
04:23:39,540 --> 04:23:41,860
I mean, it's not emotional, and I understand.

8684
04:23:41,860 --> 04:23:43,060
I've always started throwing out there,

8685
04:23:43,060 --> 04:23:44,820
seeing that we're interested in doing this whole,

8686
04:23:44,820 --> 04:23:47,420
let's take down the system and create a new system in its place.

8687
04:23:47,420 --> 04:23:49,420
But I don't think you're there yet.

8688
04:23:49,420 --> 04:23:51,220
But I do want to do that at some point.

8689
04:23:51,220 --> 04:23:52,980
But right now, I have to get Marla focused.

8690
04:23:52,980 --> 04:23:54,940
I'm just going to say, right now, it's play their game.

8691
04:23:54,940 --> 04:23:55,780
That's fine.

8692
04:23:55,780 --> 04:23:56,660
It's perfectly fine.

8693
04:23:56,660 --> 04:24:01,620
But yeah, OK, no worries.

8694
04:24:01,620 --> 04:24:04,660
And I think some of those things are going to be in your dress.

8695
04:24:04,660 --> 04:24:05,540
You all right?

8696
04:24:05,540 --> 04:24:11,660
Yeah, I think there's a lot of a year of that whole process.

8697
04:24:11,660 --> 04:24:16,060
When we talk here, and I think what I want to make sure you

8698
04:24:16,060 --> 04:24:19,020
understand is that we'll focus on the game special,

8699
04:24:19,020 --> 04:24:21,620
because that's your immediate need, right?

8700
04:24:21,620 --> 04:24:23,540
And then there's the overall need.

8701
04:24:23,540 --> 04:24:25,460
What can we solve quickly?

8702
04:24:25,460 --> 04:24:26,820
What needs to be addressed quickly?

8703
04:24:26,820 --> 04:24:31,060
And then the bigger thing, the bigger aspect of it.

8704
04:24:31,060 --> 04:24:36,180
It's not that we're not interested in that, because we are.

8705
04:24:36,180 --> 04:24:38,380
Yeah, one thing at a time.

8706
04:24:38,380 --> 04:24:41,740
Well, you're here right here.

8707
04:24:41,740 --> 04:24:44,500
What's your number one goal?

8708
04:24:44,500 --> 04:24:46,380
Marla, right?

8709
04:24:46,380 --> 04:24:48,780
So when you ask a question, it's not

8710
04:24:48,780 --> 04:24:52,860
that we're side stepping the issues, whatever it is.

8711
04:24:52,860 --> 04:24:56,100
We're focused on, because we're addressing.

8712
04:24:56,100 --> 04:24:57,540
Oh, no, absolutely.

8713
04:24:57,540 --> 04:24:58,420
You're sorry.

8714
04:24:58,420 --> 04:25:00,180
Yes, I hope that you didn't think

8715
04:25:01,140 --> 04:25:04,460
No, I don't think it's such a, I just, I do this all the time,

8716
04:25:04,460 --> 04:25:07,140
because I mean with this book, I just think you guys,

8717
04:25:07,140 --> 04:25:09,100
you don't know all the data, and if you just knew all the data,

8718
04:25:09,100 --> 04:25:11,340
you'd see how I see it.

8719
04:25:11,340 --> 04:25:12,660
That's what I'm thinking.

8720
04:25:12,660 --> 04:25:13,740
It doesn't mean it's true.

8721
04:25:13,740 --> 04:25:15,300
But it's important to me.

8722
04:25:15,300 --> 04:25:20,260
And yeah, as what you do, and what I've committed myself to do,

8723
04:25:20,260 --> 04:25:22,660
is I want you to understand what we're coming from.

8724
04:25:22,660 --> 04:25:24,260
I don't want you to walk away like,

8725
04:25:24,260 --> 04:25:25,740
I don't want to give a shit about the bigger problems.

8726
04:25:25,740 --> 04:25:26,900
No, you do.

8727
04:25:26,900 --> 04:25:28,860
But right now, you're in front of us.

8728
04:25:28,940 --> 04:25:29,780
How do we help you out?

8729
04:25:29,780 --> 04:25:32,260
Okay, thank you.

8730
04:25:32,260 --> 04:25:34,700
And thank you again.

8731
04:25:34,700 --> 04:25:36,500
And again, that's our opinion.

8732
04:25:36,500 --> 04:25:40,700
So it's not legal, it's just my opinion.

8733
04:25:40,700 --> 04:25:41,540
Cool.

8734
04:25:41,540 --> 04:25:44,260
And yeah, sorry, I know what you're doing.

8735
04:25:44,260 --> 04:25:48,300
I wasn't, yeah, can we just throw that out there?

8736
04:25:48,300 --> 04:25:50,500
No, no, no, I just want to, sometimes,

8737
04:25:50,500 --> 04:25:52,380
I think it's always better,

8738
04:25:52,380 --> 04:25:53,700
and maybe this is a fault of mine,

8739
04:25:53,700 --> 04:25:55,700
is to be more articulate and clear,

8740
04:25:55,700 --> 04:25:58,100
and to clarify stuff, so that when we walk away,

8741
04:25:58,100 --> 04:26:02,140
we're clear about what the perception was,

8742
04:26:02,140 --> 04:26:04,820
or what the intent was, but not intent to accept.

8743
04:26:04,820 --> 04:26:06,780
I know your intent, yeah, no, I trust your intent,

8744
04:26:06,780 --> 04:26:09,780
absolutely, I do trust your intent, obviously.

8745
04:26:11,260 --> 04:26:13,180
That, yeah, and I hope you trust mine.

8746
04:26:14,940 --> 04:26:16,180
You can do something you can work on,

8747
04:26:16,180 --> 04:26:19,220
if you need me, like I told you before,

8748
04:26:19,220 --> 04:26:20,500
you know, if you can't do anything,

8749
04:26:20,500 --> 04:26:23,580
and I've been through that before with Tim and Jan,

8750
04:26:23,580 --> 04:26:26,340
and when they get stuck on some sort of bureaucratic thing,

8751
04:26:26,340 --> 04:26:29,460
I'm still happy about it, so, appreciate that.

8752
04:26:30,780 --> 04:26:33,340
Good deal, I think we got a good, good work and plan.

8753
04:26:34,340 --> 04:26:36,580
Maybe, I mean, I'll even try to do some research

8754
04:26:36,580 --> 04:26:39,060
on a lawyer for you, and give you some suggestions,

8755
04:26:39,060 --> 04:26:40,260
or something like that, I don't know,

8756
04:26:40,260 --> 04:26:41,380
we'll see what I can do.

8757
04:26:41,380 --> 04:26:44,220
I don't know, just do the same research you can do,

8758
04:26:44,220 --> 04:26:46,700
but at least I can give you a,

8759
04:26:46,700 --> 04:26:48,980
okay, well, this looks good, that doesn't look good,

8760
04:26:48,980 --> 04:26:51,460
but anyway, we'll go for that part first,

8761
04:26:51,460 --> 04:26:52,780
and then if you find anything else,

8762
04:26:52,780 --> 04:26:55,340
then you can tell us who would be good.

8763
04:26:55,340 --> 04:26:58,780
I'll, can you do more specific with help with?

8764
04:26:58,780 --> 04:27:01,060
Yeah, I mean, do you know what I'm doing now?

8765
04:27:01,060 --> 04:27:02,420
Yeah, yeah.

8766
04:27:02,420 --> 04:27:04,060
So, like, today was just to assess

8767
04:27:04,060 --> 04:27:06,940
what kind of access you have, or what kind of skills you have.

8768
04:27:06,940 --> 04:27:08,780
So what I'll do is I'll write this up and ask around,

8769
04:27:08,780 --> 04:27:10,300
like maybe there's someone who might call a crime

8770
04:27:10,300 --> 04:27:12,900
who has, you know, a need for something

8771
04:27:12,900 --> 04:27:14,940
that you can help with, and then I'll find them and say,

8772
04:27:14,940 --> 04:27:15,940
hey, this is what he's got,

8773
04:27:15,940 --> 04:27:18,020
this is the skills he has, this is the access he has.

8774
04:27:18,020 --> 04:27:20,180
That's all based on what we've said today.

8775
04:27:20,180 --> 04:27:21,220
That's why if there's anything else

8776
04:27:21,220 --> 04:27:23,700
that you have access to, or crimes that you're aware of,

8777
04:27:23,700 --> 04:27:25,140
all those things are useful,

8778
04:27:25,140 --> 04:27:27,060
because then we can use that to say,

8779
04:27:27,060 --> 04:27:28,700
okay, this person can use you to this person.

8780
04:27:28,700 --> 04:27:29,540
Oh, okay.

8781
04:27:29,540 --> 04:27:30,380
Does that make sense?

8782
04:27:30,380 --> 04:27:31,220
Yeah, it makes sense.

8783
04:27:31,220 --> 04:27:33,340
Right now, we're just the gatekeepers

8784
04:27:33,340 --> 04:27:35,980
of your information, like, you give us the information,

8785
04:27:35,980 --> 04:27:37,780
we send it out to other bureau people,

8786
04:27:37,780 --> 04:27:39,620
because we can't have 800 people in the room right now.

8787
04:27:39,620 --> 04:27:41,460
Right, right, so it's a placement.

8788
04:27:41,460 --> 04:27:42,300
That's right, okay.

8789
04:27:42,300 --> 04:27:43,140
Okay, yeah.

8790
04:27:43,140 --> 04:27:44,100
That's the whole reason we're here,

8791
04:27:44,100 --> 04:27:46,220
is just to see what you can provide us

8792
04:27:46,220 --> 04:27:48,100
so that we can help you, make sense.

8793
04:27:48,100 --> 04:27:51,700
Okay, I will be putting a list of journalism.

8794
04:27:51,700 --> 04:27:52,540
Right.

8795
04:27:52,900 --> 04:27:54,180
Any questions you can always give?

8796
04:27:54,180 --> 04:27:55,540
Don't get to anybody.

8797
04:27:55,540 --> 04:27:59,660
And I can, I'm not, I can't get anything,

8798
04:27:59,660 --> 04:28:02,140
but I can get a pretty good amount of data.

8799
04:28:03,500 --> 04:28:05,220
And it would be a more specific ask, too.

8800
04:28:05,220 --> 04:28:07,300
We would say, okay, hey, do you know

8801
04:28:07,300 --> 04:28:10,260
next person at the Miami Herald or something like that?

8802
04:28:10,260 --> 04:28:11,500
What do you know about them?

8803
04:28:11,500 --> 04:28:12,340
And that would be someone else,

8804
04:28:12,340 --> 04:28:13,180
but wouldn't it be me?

8805
04:28:13,180 --> 04:28:14,780
Probably someone out of Miami, right?

8806
04:28:14,780 --> 04:28:17,540
So, anyway, we're gonna take all this stuff

8807
04:28:17,540 --> 04:28:20,740
and digest it, hopefully we can help you out at the same time.

8808
04:28:20,740 --> 04:28:21,580
But if you have any questions,

8809
04:28:21,580 --> 04:28:25,140
you can always give me a call or, you know,

8810
04:28:25,140 --> 04:28:28,060
so these guys are in LA, and I'm obviously in Houston,

8811
04:28:28,060 --> 04:28:31,060
but you know, either way, we can help you out, okay?

8812
04:28:31,060 --> 04:28:34,580
Okay, are you not gonna be an LA person?

8813
04:28:34,580 --> 04:28:35,420
No.

8814
04:28:35,420 --> 04:28:36,340
You're gonna be a Houston person.

8815
04:28:36,340 --> 04:28:37,620
I'm a Houston person, okay.

8816
04:28:37,620 --> 04:28:39,500
Yeah, so if anything develops,

8817
04:28:39,500 --> 04:28:41,220
you'll probably be having an idea.

8818
04:28:41,220 --> 04:28:42,900
Yeah, you're okay.

8819
04:28:42,900 --> 04:28:46,620
Okay, so you just came out here to discuss me.

8820
04:28:46,620 --> 04:28:48,620
Cool, man, thank you.

8821
04:28:48,620 --> 04:28:50,180
Glad to, thank you, kind of.

8822
04:28:50,300 --> 04:28:51,900
You can come all the way down there, right?

8823
04:28:51,900 --> 04:28:52,740
Yeah.

8824
04:28:53,740 --> 04:28:55,300
Oh, cool, I hope.

8825
04:28:55,300 --> 04:28:56,860
And I can't fill in there, right?

8826
04:28:56,860 --> 04:28:57,700
Yeah, please don't, yeah.

8827
04:28:57,700 --> 04:28:59,940
Not even that you had a being, or that you...

8828
04:28:59,940 --> 04:29:01,020
You live in Auburn, you know?

8829
04:29:01,020 --> 04:29:01,860
Is she okay?

8830
04:29:01,860 --> 04:29:02,700
Yeah, I don't know.

8831
04:29:02,700 --> 04:29:03,700
Auburn, obviously, knows you being there.

8832
04:29:03,700 --> 04:29:05,740
So, I don't know if I've seen her, but...

8833
04:29:05,740 --> 04:29:06,700
I wouldn't tell her anything,

8834
04:29:06,700 --> 04:29:08,620
but if I were to talk about it,

8835
04:29:08,620 --> 04:29:09,940
or if she's told us...

8836
04:29:09,940 --> 04:29:11,700
You're not even going to talk about it.

8837
04:29:11,700 --> 04:29:13,660
You're not even going to talk about it, I mean...

8838
04:29:13,660 --> 04:29:15,580
I think anyone who's seen me,

8839
04:29:15,580 --> 04:29:17,900
personally, better, I'd be talking to her in 21.

8840
04:29:17,900 --> 04:29:18,740
That'd be great.

8841
04:29:18,740 --> 04:29:21,180
You'd be talking to her in 23.

8842
04:29:21,180 --> 04:29:22,020
Not funny.

8843
04:29:22,020 --> 04:29:23,740
Yeah, I would never hear you talking to her.

8844
04:29:23,740 --> 04:29:24,740
You'd be talking to her all the time.

8845
04:29:24,740 --> 04:29:25,580
I'd play to her.

8846
04:29:25,580 --> 04:29:26,620
No, she'd play to her.

8847
04:29:26,620 --> 04:29:28,020
She would.

8848
04:29:28,020 --> 04:29:29,820
Is she around today?

8849
04:29:29,820 --> 04:29:30,780
Yeah.

8850
04:29:30,780 --> 04:29:32,580
I can play by...

8851
04:29:32,580 --> 04:29:33,900
I don't know, I could still talk to her a lot.

8852
04:29:33,900 --> 04:29:35,020
You could play by.

8853
04:29:35,020 --> 04:29:36,460
Talk to her real quick, she'd talk to her.

8854
04:29:36,460 --> 04:29:37,900
You want to come by the class?

8855
04:29:37,900 --> 04:29:39,020
Yeah, I know, yeah.

8856
04:29:39,020 --> 04:29:39,860
We've got an hour.

8857
04:29:39,860 --> 04:29:40,700
Well, let's see.

8858
04:29:40,700 --> 04:29:41,540
Let me call her.

8859
04:29:41,540 --> 04:29:43,540
She should be getting out of work.

8860
04:29:43,540 --> 04:29:45,500
She'd be done by Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

8861
04:29:45,500 --> 04:29:47,340
Yeah, she'd send me a text to whatever.

8862
04:29:47,340 --> 04:29:48,900
I'd love to hear from her.

8863
04:29:48,900 --> 04:29:49,740
Sure.

8864
04:29:49,740 --> 04:29:50,580
She'd be on the run.

8865
04:29:50,580 --> 04:29:53,580
She was kind of, you know, having to...

8866
04:29:53,580 --> 04:29:55,420
She'd be on the run.

8867
04:29:55,420 --> 04:29:56,420
She'd be down to the head.

8868
04:29:56,420 --> 04:29:57,740
She'd be on the run.

8869
04:29:57,740 --> 04:29:58,580
Really?

8870
04:29:58,580 --> 04:30:00,420
Oh, yeah.

8871
04:30:00,420 --> 04:30:01,420
Right.

8872
04:30:01,420 --> 04:30:03,420
Yeah.

8873
04:30:03,420 --> 04:30:04,420
I'd be on the run.

8874
04:30:04,420 --> 04:30:05,420
