0	10840	He shows you the tactics of what David tries to do, but he doesn't have the patience to do, because he picks topics that take four years to cover, and that's just, you're gonna fuck up, okay?
10840	11840	Yeah, yeah.
11840	15640	Unless you're like, you know, like Psy Hirsch, or something like that, right?
15640	17140	Psy Hirsch, he's not in that job.
17140	19980	Oh, he's great, you see? You have to have such discipline.
19980	21980	Oh, he doesn't have that discipline.
21980	22980	Okay.
22980	24480	Oh, you're saying you have that discipline?
24480	26820	No, I'm saying Psy Hirsch has that discipline.
26820	29820	To do a four-year story of this magnitude, right?
29820	30820	Okay.
30820	31820	He'll never waver.
31820	35820	So, David, thanks for this, I waited until 9 a.m. Tuesday, so the second thing.
35820	39820	David, thanks again for letting us film your interview with Valon Company.
39820	43820	Hats off to you for figuring so much of this out and framing a deeply human narrative around it.
43820	47820	I'm very much looking forward to, I'm basically saying I can play the Times game, too.
47820	48820	Right, right.
48820	50820	Fucking, you know, Page Boy.
50820	53820	Like, I am very much looking forward to fully digging the book.
53820	54820	I want to recognize you.
54820	55820	Oh, to fully digging the book.
55820	56820	Oh, okay.
56820	63820	I want to reiterate that I'll be, oh, I almost, I almost, when he was asking where the page
63820	64820	was, I was trying to find it.
64820	65820	And I was going to be like, hey, it's game 156.
65820	68820	I thought I heard you say, you almost, I think you did say that.
68820	69820	No, I didn't.
69820	70820	I think I thought I heard you say that.
70820	71820	I thought you didn't say it.
71820	74820	Someone, like, downstairs, you were saying, hey, who's got a copy?
74820	75820	I was like, yeah.
75820	76820	Then I shut up, yeah.
76820	77820	You didn't hear that.
77820	82820	I want to reiterate that I'll be fastidious in what makes the final cut and that will only
82820	83820	be the facts.
83820	87820	We will fact check, but this is much more of a portrait than an investigative piece.
87820	91820	So checking those facts shouldn't be overly burdensome for anyone involved, as we won't
91820	97320	be looking to break anything new, which is unless something new breaks, or focus on any
97320	99820	areas of dispute other than what we get on camera.
99820	102820	Your relationship with Val is one of many we explore with this piece.
102820	105820	We will continue to challenge him on his version of events and his actions.
105820	107820	I'll see you in a few hours.
107820	110820	But I also wanted to check to see if you're still open to a solo interview following the
110820	111820	daily taping.
111820	115820	We could do it immediately afterward, or later this afternoon's last evening.
115820	117820	We can work around your schedule.
117820	119820	All my best, Rocco.
119820	121820	Now, remember, he writes me back.
121820	122820	Let's see.
122820	123820	Within...
123820	124820	One minute?
124820	125820	No, not one minute.
125820	130820	Within 15, within 14 minutes.
130820	131820	Very fast.
131820	132820	Thanks, Rocco.
132820	133820	I appreciate your note.
133820	137820	I'm happy to sit for an interview, but let's see how and how long things go today.
137820	139820	It might be more sense to do it back in New York.
139820	142820	I also should check with NYTPR people.
142820	145820	Val made some pretty damaging allegations about me on camera yesterday.
145820	148820	He said that I had told a deseret that I would basically pay off Val.
148820	150820	He's only concerned with his business.
150820	152820	Pay off Val so that I could get a solo interview.
152820	153820	Right.
153820	154820	His business.
154820	157820	And he said that two of my sources, Tom Hayes and Tamiq Fad and both have expressed displeasure
157820	159820	with how I've handled their stories and relationships.
159820	160820	Nothing about this is the story writing of me.
160820	161820	The thing about their stories.
161820	162820	I checked with all three of them.
162820	164820	They did not, having said this to Val.
164820	167820	In the cases of Tom and Tami, they did not, having ever spoken to Val.
167820	170820	I'm attaching screenshots of their denial so you can see for yourself.
170820	174820	I'm not planning to raise this with Val today because I don't want to escalate things unnecessarily.
174820	178820	But I hope you will treat this as a clear warning that Val not only is seeking revenge against me.
178820	179820	That's his word.
179820	181820	But he is spreading false information.
181820	182820	Please tread carefully.
182820	184820	If you are considering Arion and Val's allegations, please let me know.
184820	187820	And I can give you contact in for Tami, Tami, Tom, and Odessa.
187820	189820	But then he sends me these texts, right?
189820	191820	And one of them he asks for permission.
191820	193820	One of them he asks.
193820	194820	What do you mean?
194820	195820	One of them he says.
195820	196820	And I share this with the producer.
196820	197820	Oh, you see it.
197820	198820	To whom?
198820	200820	Oh, he sees the screenshots.
200820	201820	Which is interesting.
201820	203820	Yeah, this is not kosher.
203820	205820	This is actually wire fraud.
205820	206820	No, I understand.
206820	207820	Pretty sure it is.
207820	208820	Because he's two-party consent.
208820	209820	Yes!
209820	211820	He's sharing screenshots of other people.
211820	212820	That's right.
212820	215820	And then I said to him, you're in two-party consent state.
215820	216820	You said that?
216820	217820	Yeah.
217820	219820	And he goes, you remember that California is a two-party...
219820	222820	And then later on he goes, oh yeah, because California is a two-party consent state.
222820	224820	Like, I'm basically telling him.
224820	225820	No one's ever done it.
225820	227820	No one's ever challenged.
227820	230820	Like you said, no one really comes after you just with a will.
230820	234820	But in the times, parlance, if you make a reporter look like a fucking idiot,
234820	235820	they're sending you.
235820	237820	But he thinks because I'm a reporter.
237820	239820	But then he goes and says to show it to you.
239820	241820	The dude who's fucking leaking on.
241820	242820	Right, right, right.
242820	243820	Okay?
243820	245820	So that's just chuckle head city.
245820	246820	That's funny.
246820	247820	So Isha's...
247820	250820	That's what you were doing with that day when you came and showed us, yeah.
250820	251820	You get it?
251820	252820	Yeah.
252820	253820	That's when you said I've got some news.
253820	254820	Yeah, yeah.
254820	256820	And I didn't want to do what he told me to do, right?
256820	257820	Because then I'm just as...
257820	259820	He was trying to do two things.
259820	260820	He was trying to...
260820	261820	He didn't know what I was going to say the next day.
261820	264820	He thought I was like on your side or whatever the fuck.
264820	265820	He thought you were my crew.
265820	267820	He kept seeing this in the text.
267820	269820	And the first thing I say in the microphone.
269820	270820	I'm not Val's crew.
270820	271820	I want to make it really clear.
271820	274820	Daily show, I'm not Val's crew, right?
274820	275820	Yeah, I remember.
275820	276820	I heard that.
276820	279820	So if he fucking says that on the daily, I'm going to call up their almsbudsman
279820	281820	and I'm going to fucking ream his ass.
281820	282820	Val's crew.
282820	284820	I'll shut up with his own film crew.
284820	285820	I'm going to call him up.
285820	286820	I'm going to say, well, we'll talk to him.
286820	287820	I said, guess what?
287820	291820	You got 24 hours or I'm leaking some video that makes him look fucking horrible.
291820	292820	Which video?
292820	294820	The fucking M or something.
294820	295820	Oh, leaking.
295820	297820	Like a 20 second clip that makes him look...
297820	298820	Or when he leaves, right?
298820	299820	I don't mean come on.
299820	300820	And then I'm going to say...
300820	301820	You're leaving good, leaving good.
301820	302820	I'm going to say, what do you want?
302820	304820	I'm going to say I want a letter to the editor that I get to write her a column
304820	306820	about this fucking experience and then we'll really...
306820	310820	Oh man, I wanted to do that too about my experience with him.
310820	311820	I think they should have.
311820	312820	How could you do that?
312820	313820	How could you tell him to go about doing it?
313820	314820	Who did he talk to?
314820	316820	He fucking twist their arm to a pop set of sockets.
316820	317820	That's the only way to do it.
317820	318820	Because you said something.
318820	319820	You're right.
319820	324820	But it would be better if I did it because I think it's fair.
324820	326820	And you need to write your own book.
326820	327820	We've already talked about that.
327820	328820	I don't know how to beat that horse.
328820	331820	So I'm saying, you see what I did.
331820	333820	Wait, who did you get permission from?
333820	335820	He got permission from, that's a good question.
335820	337820	Because whoever you got permission from, he's actually scared of.
337820	339820	The rest of them, he's not scared of.
339820	340820	He's not scared of Dessa.
340820	343820	Because remember, Dessa was the only one that wasn't on signal.
343820	344820	Or maybe, wait, wait.
344820	345820	You're going to care less about Dessa.
345820	349820	Wait, and he text her at 7.52 a.m.
349820	350820	That morning.
350820	351820	That morning, it must have been.
351820	353820	And I don't have the time.
353820	355820	Why would he text her that early knowing she would get back?
355820	357820	He's sending me signal?
357820	358820	No, no.
358820	360820	He must know that she was, because she's in Saudi Arabia.
360820	362820	So he knows that.
362820	365820	Why else would he do that 7 fucking 30 in the morning?
365820	366820	Jesus.
366820	369820	She'll cut you out of this quicker than you can fucking say.
369820	374820	The shopping arrangement was to tie you up while he went and got his own.
374820	375820	Wait, what?
375820	376820	Yeah.
376820	377820	It works.
377820	378820	Shopping arrangement is worthless.
378820	381820	So time me up while he goes and gets his own thing.
381820	382820	With who?
382820	384820	I don't think he's gotten it yet.
384820	385820	No, with Adessa.
385820	387820	Because that means Adessa is complicit.
387820	389820	No, Adessa can't do both, I don't think.
389820	390820	No, but she wanted to time me up.
390820	392820	No, because she could do work with David.
392820	393820	David.
393820	395820	But she, they spoke with her.
395820	398820	They spoke with David behind my back to get their own deal.
398820	399820	That's what I'm saying.
399820	400820	To have their own deal with David.
400820	401820	With the agent.
401820	402820	With the agent, right?
402820	404820	So the agent's the cutout, right?
404820	405820	No, with the agent.
405820	406820	No, with the agent.
406820	408820	The agent is the cutout.
408820	409820	Oh, the cutout.
409820	412820	Who then allows to have her hands clean, right?
412820	415820	But that's part of the course in Hollywood.
415820	417820	You can't complain about that.
417820	419820	The reporters you can complain about.
419820	421820	But that's just, you gotta be a shark.
421820	422820	And David's not a shark.
422820	423820	He's a squid.
423820	426820	Like, you know, I see exactly what they're doing.
426820	427820	It's amateur hour.
427820	429820	And the agents are gonna walk away with a bunch of money.
429820	430820	That's who's gonna win.
430820	431820	Not them.
431820	433820	Because remember we had the problem with the agents from CAA?
433820	436820	Remember we had the agents from WMA or WM, whatever?
436820	438820	The agents from CAA and WME.
438820	440820	Yeah, go ahead.
440820	442820	They are as good.
442820	445820	They are like smart FBI agents.
445820	446820	Right.
446820	448820	With an unlimited bank account.
448820	450820	Who can do whatever the fuck they want.
450820	451820	Right.
451820	452820	Stay away from agents.
452820	453820	Remember the guy?
453820	454820	Yeah, no, you're right.
454820	459820	But they said, we don't want to work with Val because apparently there's some sort of vendetta at Valhouse with Andrew Durecky.
459820	461820	I don't want to be in the middle of it.
461820	462820	Is that true, though?
462820	463820	Do you have a vendetta with him?
463820	464820	No, no.
464820	465820	You just kind of falling out with him, right?
465820	467820	No, I wanted to get back in with him.
467820	469820	So I said, get Andrew a copy of this.
469820	470820	Put it on his desk.
470820	471820	I want Andrew to do this.
471820	472820	Put it on his desk.
472820	474820	Once he sees that it's a packed, complete copy.
474820	475820	Yeah, but is he capable?
475820	476820	Andrew?
476820	477820	Oh, he's very capable.
477820	478820	Okay.
478820	479820	It just takes forever.
479820	481820	That's my problem with that shit.
481820	482820	It takes way too long.
482820	485820	But we don't want to live in that world anymore.
485820	486820	I know, I know.
486820	487820	We did when the Jinx came out.
487820	488820	Yeah.
488820	489820	Is it slow?
489820	490820	It's slow.
490820	492820	What the fuck happened here?
492820	493820	Where?
493820	494820	Data needs.
494820	496820	I don't know what that means.
496820	499820	Wait, so who got permission?
499820	500820	Tom.
500820	501820	I think it was Tom.
501820	502820	Tom.
502820	503820	Tom.
503820	504820	I'll check, but I'm almost positive.
504820	505820	But as you said, he only cared about him.
505820	506820	And Tom gave him shit.
506820	507820	Yeah, he did.
507820	508820	Tom gave him shit.
508820	510820	I wish I could see the numbers in these.
510820	511820	But he said to give them to me.
511820	512820	Yeah.
512820	516820	But the problem is, if I give them to you, again, it puts me, he's trying to trap me into a situation
516820	518820	where I do something like that, or he can discredit me.
518820	520820	Well, you decide camera.
520820	521820	What?
521820	522820	You showed it to me.
522820	523820	I showed it to you.
523820	524820	On camera?
524820	525820	Yeah, yeah.
525820	529820	But if I were to go and get the numbers, that he wouldn't give you, if I went and got the
529820	530820	numbers from him.
530820	531820	What numbers?
531820	532820	He gets up for you.
532820	533820	Oh, they're phone numbers.
533820	534820	Yeah.
534820	535820	And then I gave them to you.
535820	536820	Oh, yeah, yeah.
536820	537820	And he's held them off from you for so long, he's going to say, well, Rocco leaked it.
537820	538820	And that way, the circle's complete.
538820	540820	You know who really wanted the numbers?
540820	541820	FBI.
541820	542820	They called me and asked me for...
542820	543820	Why can't they get the fucking numbers?
543820	544820	You kidding me?
544820	545820	I don't get that.
545820	547820	They asked me for Tammy's number.
547820	550820	Well, no wonder the Trump's taking the shit on the FBI.
550820	551820	They're fucking stupid.
551820	552820	They can't find a number?
552820	553820	I found Tammy's in the fucking number.
553820	554820	I don't know if it's right.
554820	555820	I've been calling her.
555820	556820	They wanted, I guess they wanted an easy route.
556820	557820	Number?
557820	558820	They wanted an easy route.
558820	559820	They said, can you get me Tammy's number?
559820	560820	They wanted to see if you knew their numbers.
560820	562820	No, they said, I said, I don't know the numbers.
562820	564820	I said, but David obviously knows, as you know.
564820	565820	So I will ask David.
565820	566820	Do you see if you knew the numbers?
566820	567820	No.
567820	568820	I said, no, no, no.
568820	569820	Just listen.
569820	570820	Let me finish.
570820	571820	Sorry.
571820	572820	I said, I will ask David.
572820	574820	I said, David, I kind of need the number for Tammy.
574820	575820	He said, why?
575820	576820	Well, you told him why.
576820	577820	No, I didn't.
577820	578820	I never told him why.
578820	579820	No, I didn't.
579820	581820	I said, well, look, there's this whole thing, blah, blah, blah, blah.
581820	585820	And you know, I got a whistleblower friend at Deutsche Bank and he's interested in knowing
585820	588820	if you can cross-reference some of his data with the data of Tammy's.
588820	593820	He goes, well, you know, okay, if I can't give you her number, but you know what?
593820	594820	I can give you the lawyer's number.
594820	595820	Here's the lawyer's number.
595820	596820	That's it.
596820	598820	So I said, I went back to the FBI.
598820	601820	I said, FBI, I'm sorry, this is the best I could do.
601820	609820	And to be fair to David or anybody, you can't operate as an extension of law enforcement.
609820	613820	That's the worst thing a journalist could ever do, because you'll never gain your credibility back.
613820	614820	Right.
614820	615820	And that's what it is.
615820	616820	And in that instance, that's what it is.
616820	617820	No, but you got worse.
617820	622820	What happened was, because I didn't even get the number, one of the FBI agents called
622820	628820	up, called up the lawyer, sorry, called up the David Enrich directly.
628820	634820	How did they get the number from me and said, hey, we would like Tammy's number.
634820	638820	And then everyone in the fucking New York Times flipped out, flipped the fuck out.
638820	641820	And then that's why they included the FBI in the story.
641820	643820	So the FBI called us looking for him.
643820	648820	And then they said, basically, he called the, the FBI ended up calling the lawyer.
648820	651820	David calls me and says, oh my God, you never even guess what just happened.
651820	652820	It's the craziest thing in the world.
652820	654820	You know that guy that the FBI you're working with?
654820	655820	He just called me.
655820	656820	I'm like, no.
656820	657820	It was funny.
657820	658820	I couldn't believe it.
658820	660820	When you told the story tomorrow, that's what you told me.
660820	664820	No, and then, no, but that's because then the next day, the FBI, I called them and was
664820	666820	like, dude, what are you doing, you guys?
666820	668820	I could have gotten your number just like waited around a little longer.
668820	669820	Why did you call David?
669820	672820	Because now you're going to be in the story and I'm in the story, right?
672820	674820	Because I'm the one with the connection here.
674820	677820	And the guy's about, he apologized, but I'm so sorry.
677820	678820	We fucked up.
678820	680820	No, it's funny, it really is.
680820	681820	He said, I'm so sorry.
681820	682820	Fuck that.
682820	683820	We shouldn't have done that.
683820	684820	We shouldn't have done that.
684820	685820	We should have just let you do it.
685820	686820	I'm so sorry.
686820	687820	I just couldn't wait any longer.
687820	688820	I wanted to try and get it myself.
688820	691820	Why the fuck is the FBI so interested in these people?
691820	693820	In this story, in this particular?
693820	694820	They're not.
694820	695820	They're interested in the Starz reports.
695820	696820	And that's when you...
696820	698820	Because David had no documentation.
698820	700820	That's why I kept bringing that shit up.
700820	701820	He did have documentation.
701820	702820	No, he didn't.
702820	703820	He has nothing.
703820	704820	He doesn't.
704820	705820	What is he doing?
705820	706820	He's calling down.
706820	708820	He's just the fucking word of his word and Tammy's word.
708820	710820	And they think that's enough to have a story.
710820	711820	It is for a book, unfortunately.
711820	712820	What?
712820	713820	It's for a book.
713820	714820	It is enough to sell the book.
714820	716820	No, but it was the article that...
716820	717820	No, you're right, you're right.
717820	718820	Read the article with Tammy.
718820	719820	There's nothing.
719820	720820	You're right.
720820	721820	No one saw it.
721820	722820	No one has it.
722820	723820	Tammy supposedly saw it.
723820	725820	That's why they questioned if she was credible or not.
725820	726820	Yes.
726820	727820	Do you think she's credible?
727820	728820	Yes, she's credible.
728820	729820	I think she's credible, too.
729820	730820	But I think David is when it's not credible.
730820	735820	He's the one that's writing this up in his spin without any documentation or anything.
735820	737820	Because he got so deep in that there was no way out.
737820	740820	Yeah, when he got all the way down there, he was really excited and he came up back with
740820	741820	nothing.
741820	742820	No reports.
742820	743820	Long paper work.
743820	744820	Long paper work.
744820	745820	David, David, he's got it.
745820	746820	He's got something.
746820	747820	It's fraudulent.
747820	748820	I'm going to press him on it.
748820	749820	Press him?
749820	750820	Fucking hard.
750820	751820	I'm going to say, we're talking about this a lot.
751820	752820	We're talking about this a lot.
752820	754820	Because it's all I care about.
754820	758820	That's where dispute, when I put the pen in it, that's exactly where dispute is.
758820	760820	And all the rest of the shit's noise.
760820	762820	Where are the fucking lenders?
762820	764820	I'm trying to get them in.
764820	765820	I know.
765820	766820	I don't think we're going to get them, right?
766820	767820	I'm going to try.
767820	771820	But if they're fraudulent, it's just as important and weird as if they're real, right?
771820	774820	But we don't know if it's really fraudulent because only Deutsche Bank has said they're fraudulent.
774820	776820	Only Deutsche Bank has said that.
776820	777820	That's what I'm saying.
777820	782820	But they could be fraudulent because the Russians signed off-room with dead money that isn't
782820	786820	real money and not real fucking lenders because they don't have the right to lend through
786820	787820	Deutsche Bank.
787820	789820	I'm going to bring up a good point, but what is fraudulent to them?
789820	791820	What is they saying is fraudulent?
791820	794820	Because in my head, fraudulent, in everyone's head means, oh, someone faked the document.
794820	795820	Well, that's ordinary.
795820	796820	That's not fraudulent.
796820	797820	Well, that's-
797820	801820	Fraudulent would be the Russians signed off on them and weren't officers in the company.
801820	803820	Oh, that's interesting too.
803820	805820	Just fucking recording everything, huh?
805820	806820	That's interesting too.
806820	807820	Yeah, that's just the thing right there.
807820	808820	That shit.
808820	809820	I have it set.
809820	811820	When are you going to turn on me?
811820	812820	I'm going to turn on you.
812820	814820	I just don't want to make sure you don't turn on me.
814820	815820	Dude, I don't-
815820	816820	You're a journalist.
816820	817820	Look at my history.
817820	818820	But you're still a journalist.
818820	819820	Understood.
819820	821820	And I haven't had very good luck with journalists.
821820	822820	I see that.
822820	823820	But I also think-
823820	824820	Marie, Marie.
824820	827820	I'm trying to give you- have you ever had a journalist tell you that I think you're
827820	830820	just approaching- you're trusting them too much?
830820	832820	Have you ever had a journalist tell you that?
832820	833820	No, I did.
833820	834820	No, no.
834820	835820	No, so that should tell you something.
835820	836820	But you're an ex-journalist.
836820	837820	That's a good thing.
837820	838820	I'm not an ex-journalist.
838820	839820	Dude, I took a chance with you.
839820	840820	Don't worry.
840820	841820	Well, you did take a chance.
841820	842820	If I thought you were- I wouldn't have had you.
842820	843820	You wouldn't be here talking with me.
843820	846820	What I'm saying is someone gets your shit and like, you know, like, fucks me.
846820	847820	No, but okay.
847820	848820	Oh, no, no, I wasn't gonna get my shit.
848820	849820	I don't think I've said anything.
849820	851820	Anything I've said right now, I would say on a daily show.
851820	852820	Dude, I didn't-
852820	853820	I didn't-
853820	855820	I actually wasn't supposed to.
855820	857820	I wasn't supposed to record.
857820	859820	I actually accidentally did in it.
859820	863820	But now, oh, hey, could think maybe you could read those texts for us?
863820	864820	Yeah.
864820	865820	I mean, not like-
865820	866820	I'm not recording or anything.
866820	867820	No, we read them on camera.
867820	868820	I don't care if you're recording.
868820	869820	It's very easy.
869820	870820	Yeah, just for ourselves.
870820	871820	Because you won't give us the other things.
871820	872820	So I'm gonna-
872820	873820	I'm gonna give you shit.
873820	875820	I really want to listen to day one of the fucking date.
875820	876820	This is my-
876820	877820	It's my bounty.
877820	878820	I took a risk, too.
878820	881820	You know, I didn't know if that guy was gonna walk out or like, you know, I spent a bunch
881820	882820	of money on bullshit.
882820	883820	I know, I know.
883820	884820	You didn't.
884820	885820	Yeah, but you-
885820	886820	We're all taking it.
886820	887820	We have to.
887820	888820	We're trusting each other.
888820	889820	That's the way we have to do it.
889820	890820	Yeah, and-
890820	891820	And you're trust-
891820	892820	I wasn't sure and I-
892820	895820	No, and then I spoke to you on the phone and I was like, no, I think he's good.
895820	896820	Yeah, you didn't.
896820	897820	But first, I thought you were crazy.
897820	898820	I was like, I think he's crazy.
898820	899820	I am crazy.
899820	901820	No, I thought, you know, he thought you're like a madman, up the streets.
901820	903820	Because you know what I thought you were?
903820	905820	I thought you were stalking me since 2014, actually.
905820	906820	Why?
906820	909820	Because I thought, you know what, this sounds a lot like the guy who said he was from Vice
909820	911820	in 2014 during the Sony hack.
911820	913820	He said, come down to LA and hide in my basement.
913820	914820	Dude, I-
914820	915820	Listen to me.
915820	916820	There was a guy-
916820	917820	I didn't tell you this yet.
917820	918820	I was in the room-
918820	919820	It was you.
919820	920820	I was in the room with Seth Rogen.
920820	921820	Yeah.
921820	922820	And his partner, Evan.
922820	923820	Yeah.
923820	924820	At the fucking lot.
924820	925820	Yeah.
925820	928820	When the shit went down, I got the only interview with Seth and Franco and all the people.
928820	929820	That's good.
929820	930820	And it's online.
930820	931820	Yeah.
931820	932820	And then they pull the movie.
932820	936820	And I get a call from Seth and he's like, dude, they're fucking canceling the movie.
936820	938820	Because I told him they're gonna cancel this fucking movie.
938820	939820	He's like, how do they do that?
939820	940820	I said, I don't know.
940820	943820	But then I'm driving and I see them taking the poster down.
943820	945820	I'm like, this is like Nazi Germany.
945820	946820	What the fuck is going on?
946820	947820	Yeah.
947820	948820	Go over to the fucking thing.
948820	949820	They're smoking tons of weed.
949820	951820	And I'm like, guys, first thing's first.
951820	956820	I like, I like marijuana too, but you need to put that bong down because this is some fucked
956820	957820	up shit.
957820	958820	Right?
958820	959820	Yeah.
959820	961820	And they got on the phone with Michael Linden and listened to it all.
961820	962820	Michael Linden.
962820	963820	And they fucking.
963820	967820	I sat next to him at the dead Andy Drecky's screening of the Jinx.
967820	968820	I sat right next to him.
968820	969820	Didn't know who he was.
969820	972820	That day I was looking through his inbox and posting it all online.
972820	974820	Anyway, I'll read you these texts and then I gotta go.
974820	975820	No, okay.
975820	976820	Come on.
976820	977820	I'll do it.
977820	978820	So what was the end of your story?
978820	982820	So, you remember the interviews based on Vice's shit, right?
982820	983820	Wait, on Vice's shit?
983820	984820	We went to North Korea, right?
984820	985820	Oh, was that really?
985820	989820	Yeah, and they called me up like two years before the movie came out and they said, can
989820	991820	you hook us up with the guys that went to North Korea?
991820	992820	We'll pay them.
992820	993820	We need research.
993820	994820	Okay.
994820	995820	Franco was writing for me at the time.
995820	996820	Okay.
996820	997820	Right?
997820	999820	So, man, that really ended weird.
999820	1004820	Franco now does AA speeches all over Los Angeles.
1004820	1006820	Does it really?
1006820	1008820	That's his redemption?
1008820	1011820	I can email him right now or text him and he'll fucking call me.
1011820	1014820	He'll fuck to anybody.
1014820	1016820	Tell me who's the sponsor.
1016820	1018820	Who won't talk to me now is Seth, though.
1018820	1020820	I didn't do anything wrong to him.
1020820	1021820	They just said...
1021820	1022820	Why?
1022820	1026820	Because they basically Hollywood said, we can't have rock'n'roll in this shit anymore.
1026820	1027820	Why?
1027820	1029820	Why did you fuck with them?
1029820	1036820	Well, because Vice was a golden ticket for a lot of people.
1036820	1037820	Why?
1037820	1038820	I don't know.
1038820	1039820	I'm still not asking that question.
1039820	1040820	Why anyone thought that?
1040820	1041820	Yeah.
1041820	1045820	Now it's all in the Wall Street Journal, so I don't have to convince anyone.
1045820	1047820	Read this so I can tune this out.
1047820	1052820	Here's the Tammy text.
1052820	1053820	Thank you, David.
1053820	1054820	Just got your book.
1054820	1055820	Can't wait to read it.
1055820	1056820	Congratulations.
1056820	1057820	And that looks like it was from a few days ago.
1057820	1058820	It doesn't say the date.
1058820	1059820	Today, 5.33 p.m.
1059820	1062820	So that would be the first day of the interview following the interview, right?
1062820	1063820	Actually, the interview again.
1063820	1064820	I hope you like it.
1064820	1065820	This is David.
1065820	1068820	Just so you know, I'm in LA right now with Val Brochement, who is filming a documentary.
1068820	1069820	She isn't true.
1069820	1071820	Told me it wasn't true.
1071820	1073820	Rocco Castoro is filming a documentary.
1073820	1075820	Rocco doesn't want to be a credit.
1075820	1076820	I don't want the credit.
1076820	1077820	He's so Hollywood.
1077820	1079820	I do want the credit.
1079820	1081820	And, you know, it's also a discredit.
1081820	1084820	The whole discredits it if you're shooting a documentary on yourself.
1084820	1085820	Hey, hey.
1085820	1087820	A documentary on themselves?
1087820	1088820	What are you, a fucking rapper?
1088820	1090820	Yeah, I mean, come on, dude.
1090820	1091820	It's true.
1091820	1092820	I hope you like it.
1092820	1094820	Just so you know, I'm in LA right now with Val Brochement, who is filming a documentary
1094820	1097820	set on a camera that you're really unhappy with me and how I treated you.
1097820	1099820	I don't know if you talked to him or told him that.
1099820	1101820	But if you do feel that way, I'm so sorry to hear it.
1101820	1104820	As I told Val, I have the utmost respect for you and everything you've done.
1104820	1106820	And I have tried hard to treat you well.
1106820	1107820	And I've done anything wrong.
1107820	1108820	I sincerely apologize.
1108820	1109820	Which, let's be clear.
1109820	1110820	You didn't say that.
1110820	1111820	No.
1111820	1112820	The reporter said that.
1112820	1113820	And I clearly said, I did not speak to Tammy.
1113820	1114820	Who is Val?
1114820	1116820	Question mark, exclamation mark, question mark, question mark.
1116820	1118820	I do not know this person in question mark.
1118820	1122820	And then like the, ooh, like the face, the emojis, right?
1122820	1123820	Tammy.
1123820	1128820	And then David says, he's the son of the DB executive committed suicide in 2014.
1128820	1130820	She says, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
1130820	1131820	Question mark, question mark.
1131820	1132820	Okay.
1132820	1134820	Like almost at the point where I'm like, does she know Val?
1134820	1135820	I do not see the email.
1135820	1138820	That was my first I was like, does she know Val?
1138820	1140820	But no, she's just, that's how she talks.
1140820	1141820	I didn't send emails there.
1141820	1142820	She doesn't remember.
1142820	1143820	Okay.
1143820	1144820	It's fine.
1144820	1145820	He might have been lying.
1145820	1146820	Don't worry.
1146820	1147820	Don't worry.
1147820	1149820	I do not know him and I have never had a conversation with him.
1149820	1150820	Period.
1150820	1151820	I believe you 100%.
1151820	1152820	Don't worry.
1152820	1153820	It's unbelievable.
1153820	1154820	People are weird.
1154820	1155820	Can you please call me?
1155820	1156820	We have the footage.
1156820	1157820	You didn't say it.
1157820	1160820	He said a lot of shit, but you didn't say that.
1160820	1161820	Hey, Tom.
1161820	1162820	This is Tom Hayes.
1162820	1166820	So he suspects that you just don't remember what just happened and you don't have video
1166820	1167820	cameras.
1167820	1168820	No, he's drunk or some shit.
1168820	1169820	No, but sending it to you.
1169820	1171820	He wasn't planning on sending these to me.
1171820	1175820	I forced him to do it when I sent him that email in the morning.
1175820	1176820	Oh really?
1176820	1177820	He panicked.
1177820	1178820	Why?
1178820	1179820	Yeah, why?
1179820	1180820	Think about it.
1180820	1184820	He was in the WALT in here the next day and I don't know if he was either, he probably
1184820	1188820	wasn't going to bring these up because it would escalate it, but this was his backstop.
1188820	1189820	I was in.
1189820	1190820	And I said, that's my motherfucker.
1190820	1191820	Do you remember when he left?
1191820	1195820	When he left, he said, he said, remember about tomorrow there's going to be a big announcement?
1195820	1196820	Yeah, and he didn't make an announcement.
1196820	1197820	Nothing happened.
1197820	1198820	He said, Tammy was in.
1198820	1200820	He wanted me to be his dildo.
1200820	1202820	Yeah, to make the announcement for him.
1202820	1204820	And I said, you're the dildo, bro.
1204820	1205820	Sorry.
1205820	1209540	Because he says, hey Tom, I was meeting today with Al Brochement and like this is, I have
1209540	1210540	no problem.
1210540	1212260	This is how I'm going to talk on my daily show.
1212260	1213260	Yeah.
1213260	1215420	You know, I'm just going to call journalists, dildos and stuff because they are, and this
1215420	1216420	is ridiculous.
1216420	1220100	Like, hey Tom, I was meeting today with Al Brochement who's involved in Deutsche Bank
1220100	1223980	Sider and he told me, as we're being filmed for a documentary he's doing, once again,
1223980	1228300	Rocco Castoro is doing, that you and Sarah were very unhappy with how I treated you in
1228300	1229300	the book.
1229300	1232060	I don't know if you've talked to Val or told him that, but this is how you feel.
1232060	1233700	I am very sorry.
1233700	1234700	Who is he?
1234700	1235700	My mom was.
1235700	1236700	This is Tom.
1236700	1239420	I didn't realize you would use so much about her.
1239420	1242700	That caused problems between mom and Sarah and this is, he went to jail, right?
1242700	1243700	Yeah.
1243700	1244700	14 years.
1244700	1245940	That caused problems between mom and Sarah, but they always hated each other.
1245940	1250300	My honest view is that it was a bit hyperbolic and that Japanese Libor is not linked to retail
1250300	1251300	products at all.
1251300	1253380	I mean, this guy has really valid points.
1253380	1254860	Certainly not credit cards and strident loans.
1254860	1259420	I think you conflated USD and, is it Japanese Libor?
1259420	1263140	I also failed to look properly at what triggered the investigation.
1263140	1267500	It's low balling and what the rules actually weren't as is the case, but I can't expect
1267500	1271420	you to read a book for the defense, which is interesting that he says that.
1271420	1273140	You can't read a book for the defense.
1273140	1276060	He's basically saying, you need to be salacious, I get it.
1276060	1277260	You wrote it in the absence of all the fresh evidence.
1277260	1279420	He's also saying he didn't help me.
1279420	1280420	Yes.
1280420	1283180	Well, he hedges that later.
1283180	1285100	So he's fair at least.
1285100	1288580	You wrote it in the absence of all the fresh evidence we now have in new witnesses.
1288580	1291740	That's interesting because he wrote it without that.
1291740	1292740	He could have included that.
1292740	1294380	The book wasn't even out yet.
1294380	1295380	That's true.
1295380	1298100	He wrote it at a time when I was considered guilty by most in the book, at least caused
1298100	1299100	a review of that narrative.
1299100	1300100	That's where he's fair.
1300100	1302380	I know that because of all the mail that was sent to me by complete strangers, which
1302380	1305900	again is like, what mail, like the book's not out yet.
1305900	1310340	So I guess what he's saying is mail that while David was doing his reporting, they mailed
1310340	1313820	him saying, hey, I'm sorry, this happened to you and that's the only thing I can imagine.
1313820	1315580	Sources and friends of his?
1315580	1318260	I don't know yet who David was calling, right?
1318260	1319260	That's the only thing I can think of.
1319260	1321460	And Sarah Deffo wasn't happy with it.
1321460	1324860	Maybe he heard from Andrew Verity, who's the FT reporter who you know.
1324860	1325860	He contacted me.
1325860	1326860	That's the guy.
1326860	1327860	Holy shit.
1327860	1328860	Andrew Verity.
1328860	1329860	He contacted me on Twitter.
1329860	1330860	He wants to talk to me.
1330860	1331860	One more.
1331860	1332860	I have, look, I have things for him.
1332860	1333860	Well, that's the view.
1333860	1334860	Maybe you should talk to him now.
1334860	1335860	Fuck, yeah.
1335860	1336860	Good thing you regret this thing.
1336860	1340740	I did tell him that I thought the book was too light on the BOE and the treasury rule
1340740	1341740	on this.
1341740	1343980	I only discovered Mom Knew Tom Scholar.
1343980	1347060	So much was only just discovered Mom Knew Tom Scholar.
1347060	1348060	So much was hidden.
1348060	1349140	So Sarah hates him.
1349140	1350140	That's the one.
1350140	1351140	That's why I said the wife.
1351140	1352140	I said that on camera, the wife hates you.
1352140	1353140	Yes, he did.
1353140	1354140	I did.
1354140	1355140	I said that positively.
1355140	1359420	Bar the RBC section that you never spoke to me about.
1359420	1360420	Their narrative was wrong.
1360420	1361420	RBC section?
1361420	1362420	So don't worry if you even worry.
1362420	1363420	I have no idea.
1363420	1364420	So you got something wrong.
1364420	1365420	RBC section.
1365420	1366420	It is.
1366420	1367420	Risk, uh...
1367420	1368420	Risk something.
1368420	1369420	Strangely, I like you, David.
1369420	1370420	Risk break up.
1370420	1371420	This is the weirdest text I've ever read.
1371420	1372420	Strangely.
1372420	1373420	Strangely, I like you, David.
1373420	1377100	But as you say in your book, this guy's actually fucking great.
1377100	1378660	Sometimes friends aren't friends.
1378660	1382020	And, you know, that's what Barrett was going off about.
1382020	1383020	It's good.
1383100	1384100	Friends.
1384100	1385100	Because he learned the hard way, right?
1385100	1386100	That's true.
1386100	1387100	He's saying what you're saying.
1387100	1388100	Yeah.
1388100	1389100	Hopefully, in this occasion, I do get it.
1389100	1390100	Wait, when did I say that?
1390100	1391100	Well, that's what you said to me.
1391100	1392100	You said David was your friend.
1392100	1393100	Oh, I did.
1393100	1394100	And you can't be friends.
1394100	1395100	You can't be friends with journalists, Val.
1395100	1396100	You can't.
1396100	1397100	Yeah, you're right.
1397100	1398100	You know what I mean?
1398100	1399100	You can.
1399100	1400100	I'll tell you this.
1400100	1401100	You can.
1401100	1402100	And the problem with David and me, for me, is this.
1402100	1407340	He used you for sources on other stories, then you thought of him as a friend, which
1407340	1412820	that is kosher in certain regards, where if you've used a source and you like that person
1412820	1418420	and you want to be a human, you know, so I thought it was, I thought we were friends.
1418420	1419420	So I called him a friend.
1419420	1420420	I called him.
1420420	1421420	It was the first story that he called me.
1421420	1422420	He used you.
1422420	1423420	No, he didn't say this.
1423420	1424420	We were friends.
1424420	1429860	And then all of a sudden, it became his best interest to not be friends with me and to
1429860	1430860	use me instead.
1430860	1431860	And then that's what happened.
1431860	1435740	But you can never be friends with your sources.
1435740	1438860	But see, and the difference is like, I can shoot a film about you.
1438860	1441220	How do you not be friends if you're five years and talking to me?
1441220	1442220	Oh, shit.
1442620	1443620	You're a human, right?
1443620	1446020	That's why you don't take five years to report something.
1446020	1449020	You make a fucking documentary.
1449020	1450020	That's why you do it.
1450020	1451420	Like, I'm not joking.
1451420	1455220	Like, I don't buy this bullshit that people are like, well, I'm a print journalist.
1455220	1456780	Well, then you're fucking a dinosaur.
1456780	1458540	Like, you have to do all of it.
1458540	1461820	And it's really important because this proves it.
1461820	1466060	This fucking, you know, regurgitation is better shit, right?
1466060	1468940	So it's like, strangely, I like you, David, but as you say in your books, sometimes friends
1468940	1469940	aren't friends.
1469940	1471660	Hopefully in this occasion, I do get it.
1471660	1472660	Maybe I'm wrong.
1472660	1473660	I'm not sure if Sarah wants us to talk.
1473660	1475060	To be honest, I'm confused.
1475060	1477060	He said, thanks, Tom.
1477060	1478060	For what?
1478060	1481060	And he said, for your response.
1481060	1482060	Oh, that's okay.
1482060	1486020	And it looks like, it says today, so it looks like that was at five.
1486020	1489220	That was right after the interview, so he was fucking furious about that shit.
1489220	1491860	And then the next day he wrote and said, thanks, Tom.
1491860	1492860	Oh, that's okay.
1492860	1496780	He said, if it is okay, I tell the TV producer that you're not unhappy with how I've treated
1496780	1497780	you.
1497780	1500300	Otherwise, I'm concerned they're going to take valid his word that you aren't happy
1500300	1501300	with me.
1502300	1505900	What the fuck, my, he does not fit, there are cameras there, I don't have to take you
1505900	1506900	at your word.
1506900	1507900	Why is he texting?
1507900	1508900	Why is he showing you this?
1508900	1509900	I don't know.
1509900	1510900	It's ridiculous.
1510900	1514420	You think I expected to get this back 10 minutes after I fucking e-mail, but I knew
1514420	1518900	if I waited the morning that whatever trap he had laid, I just ganged it.
1518900	1519900	So weird.
1519900	1521900	Or if he didn't, then it was fine.
1521900	1522900	Yeah, I can't talk.
1522900	1527180	It says, I was talking to the TV producer that you're not unhappy, now I'm a TV producer
1527180	1528180	obviously.
1528460	1531260	Otherwise, I'm concerned they're going to take valid his word that you aren't happy
1531260	1532260	with me.
1532260	1536260	Yeah, I can't talk to him, but isn't that guy someone, someone who's dad died?
1536260	1537760	He said, yes.
1537760	1543060	And then he, Tom says, the producer or Val, which he's like, I don't, I don't want to
1543060	1544060	laugh at that.
1544060	1545060	He's confused.
1545060	1546780	But then he says, I'll level with you.
1546780	1550460	But then David says, the producer, right?
1550460	1555260	Yeah, I can't talk to him, but isn't that guy someone's who's dad died?
1555260	1556260	Yes.
1556260	1557260	Tom.
1557340	1559860	The producer or Val question mark, I'll level with you.
1559860	1561700	This is still Tom.
1561700	1562700	The producer.
1562700	1563700	Oh, and I would see what he's saying.
1563700	1566260	He's saying, will you, can I, who, who should I tell?
1566260	1567260	Right, right, right.
1567260	1568260	Sorry, that's my mistake.
1568260	1573000	You can show him this part of the chat, but then they talked about something else.
1573000	1577060	This one was the only one not on, you don't remember, these are on signal.
1577060	1580060	So a text screenshot is one thing.
1580060	1585460	But if I'm texting on signal and I have it auto-delete and you do that, you better be
1585460	1588220	fucking ready to rumble.
1588220	1592500	From my perspective, if you better be ready to fucking rumble, I'll wait 10 years and
1592500	1593500	I'm going to get you.
1593500	1595500	I texted your stuff to Barrett.
1595500	1597500	I don't give a shit.
1597500	1598500	Barrett's fine.
1598500	1599500	That's because I didn't introduce you to Barrett.
1599500	1600500	It's like, here's this guy.
1600500	1601500	I sent Barrett all my...
1601500	1602500	I told him, I like him.
1602500	1603500	He's a pretty good guy.
1603500	1604500	He talks a lot.
1604500	1610060	You know, but I think he knows what he's doing and he appears to be saying, honestly, I like
1610060	1611060	him.
1611060	1612060	Thank you.
1612060	1613060	That's what my assessment of you.
1613060	1614060	Thank you.
1614060	1617420	I think Barrett realized that we know a lot of the same people.
1617420	1620700	Once I told him that I was commissioned to write We Are Anonymous, which is Parmi Olson's
1620700	1624460	book and he's in it, and how meta this was and that I wanted to commission him before
1624460	1627220	he went to jail, but we just didn't get to that point.
1627220	1631620	And I know different people, Del Cameron and Daily Dot people and all these people.
1631620	1634060	And I have a deep understanding of anonymous.
1634060	1638180	And we talked about how that morphed into Paul and my Paul right.
1638180	1643420	I need to finish this and then maybe, you know, I just don't throw me into it because
1643420	1644780	I don't want to like walk.
1644780	1648820	I got thrown into some group to give a day that was like, cuck, what was it?
1648820	1653420	It was like, no cucks allowed part two or something and I was like, what the fuck did
1653420	1654420	someone put me in?
1654420	1657340	It was like some fucking neo-nazi meme shit.
1657340	1661340	And I'm like, dude, someone's trying to set me up or something and I just said, fuck all
1661340	1662340	you Nazis.
1662340	1663340	And I left the grid.
1663340	1667340	Hi, I guess I hope you're doing well.
1667340	1672460	I mean, this is again, you know, this is one for us to hear this.
1673460	1674460	I hope you're doing well.
1674460	1675460	I'm in LA recording.
1675460	1676460	And this is 7 52 a.m.
1676460	1678460	So that would be the next morning.
1678460	1680460	He screenshot 9 24.
1680460	1681460	Okay.
1681460	1688460	So you got to remember that he screenshot this after I wrote him.
1688460	1689460	Okay.
1689460	1690460	You know what I'm saying?
1690460	1691460	Because this was his big news.
1691460	1693460	And then he said, oh, wait, I can use Rocco.
1693460	1694460	Like he like, right?
1694460	1696460	He thought he could be a step.
1696460	1697460	All right.
1697460	1698460	Look at this.
1698460	1699460	And then he says at the end.
1699460	1702460	Well, you're, I can't remember if he said your friend.
1702460	1708460	He said our friends, our friends, our friends have some stuff to tell you in the master
1708460	1709460	interview.
1709460	1710460	I don't know if you caught that.
1710460	1711460	I did not.
1711460	1712460	Yeah, he says it to you.
1712460	1713460	That's why I didn't tell you.
1713460	1714460	So wait, wait, what?
1714460	1716460	He says our friends or something.
1716460	1717460	I'm not.
1717460	1718460	It may not be correct.
1718460	1719460	Something friends.
1719460	1720460	It doesn't say your friends.
1720460	1724460	I don't think the world will be real fucked up and I'm going to hit him on that.
1724460	1728460	You know, I'm not going to hit him on it, but I'm going to complain.
1728460	1732460	And be like, you know, David, if you talk about this again, you know that I'm doing this
1732460	1733460	independently, right?
1733460	1736460	Like, like I didn't know that you've known down for four fucking years.
1736460	1739460	Like you are in five years.
1739460	1740460	You are in that seat.
1740460	1741460	I'm not in that seat.
1741460	1744460	I got in and I got out and I got you on camera.
1744460	1745460	I'm not your fucking friend.
1745460	1747460	So don't make me your enemy.
1747460	1752460	And, you know, I'm going to basically be like, how would you like it if I fucking said,
1752460	1755460	Oh, Val's got a story is right.
1755460	1757460	Val's got a story is right.
1757460	1759460	He's got a New York Times reporter.
1759460	1761460	He's writing it with a New York Times reporter.
1761460	1765460	You wouldn't like it at all because you did everything within your power to make sure
1765460	1767460	that no one could say that.
1767460	1770460	So we know you wouldn't like it.
1770460	1773460	And, you know, go to Mark Thompson and ask him about me.
1773460	1775460	Ask him how dangerous a fucking am with the media.
1775460	1778460	Like, you know, go ask him and then go ask him.
1778460	1779460	Yeah.
1779460	1780460	The pedophilia.
1780460	1781460	He was good.
1781460	1782460	Pedophilia.
1782460	1786460	He covered up at the BBC that came out two weeks after he started at the Times.
1787460	1789460	Anyway, hi, I hope you're doing well.
1789460	1792460	I'm in LA recording a podcast interview with Val and he's filming a documentary.
1792460	1796460	He said on camera yesterday that you told him that when you and I met in NYT at NYT.
1796460	1800460	Yeah, that's like, you didn't say at NYT because you didn't know they were at NYT, right?
1800460	1802460	No, they said outside in a cafe.
1802460	1804460	Yeah, but you never brought up.
1804460	1810460	He's bringing up that he's giving up the fact that she met him at a New York Times.
1810460	1811460	He got confused though.
1811460	1812460	He's not doing that on purpose.
1812460	1814460	No, but exactly he's giving up something.
1814460	1819460	I told that if I got a film deal that didn't include Val, it would be fine because I would
1819460	1822460	just throw lots of money at Val and he would be pacified.
1822460	1824460	Is that true that you said that to Val?
1824460	1826460	And this seems a bit...
1826460	1827460	Set up.
1827460	1828460	Yeah.
1828460	1829460	I'm not going to say that.
1829460	1830460	Hello.
1830460	1831460	But...
1831460	1832460	Very much.
1832460	1833460	I'm going to say this in the text.
1833460	1834460	Right.
1834460	1835460	Screenshot it, right?
1835460	1837460	Because this isn't the morning.
1837460	1838460	Right.
1838460	1839460	I know.
1839460	1840460	Okay.
1840460	1842460	I told you I got a film deal that didn't include Val would be fine because I would just throw
1842460	1844460	lots of money at Val and he would be pacified.
1844460	1846460	Is that true that she said that to Val?
1846460	1850460	I have no recollection of ever having said anything like that to you or anyone else.
1850460	1851460	That was David.
1851460	1853460	Odessa says, I never said that.
1853460	1855460	No, I would have never said that.
1855460	1857460	I don't remember talking to you about that.
1857460	1858460	Or Val.
1858460	1859460	Dot, dot, dot.
1859460	1860460	That's it.
1860460	1862460	You got a problem with this Odessa woman.
1862460	1863460	I don't know who she is.
1863460	1866460	I'd love to stick a fucking camera in her face.
1866460	1869460	She texted me just when we walked in the door.
1869460	1870460	Well, don't do it now.
1870460	1871460	Because.
1871460	1872460	Do it tomorrow.
1872460	1874460	Make sure it's there.
1874460	1876460	Oh, okay.
1876460	1878460	I've got.
1878460	1879460	Okay.
1879460	1883460	We are going to go today.
1883460	1886460	15th, February 15th.
1886460	1887460	What's that?
1887460	1888460	I don't know.
1888460	1889460	We're heard from him.
1889460	1890460	Who's that?
1890460	1891460	David.
1891460	1892460	No.
1892460	1893460	I will call him Monday.
1893460	1894460	What we're doing is...
1894460	1895460	You're going to call him tomorrow?
1895460	1896460	Monday.
1896460	1897460	It's Sunday.
1897460	1898460	I don't know if it's Sunday.
1898460	1899460	You're going to call him tomorrow.
1899460	1900460	Do you want a camera?
1900460	1901460	Oh.
1901460	1903460	If you want to do that, we can do that.
1903460	1904460	Yeah.
1904460	1905460	And I probably...
1905460	1906460	I got that reversed.
1906460	1908460	Look, I was saying if you want to ask one camera.
1908460	1909460	Oh.
1909460	1910460	If you want to ask one camera.
1910460	1911460	To call him?
1911460	1913460	And ask him for the reports.
1913460	1915460	After we talk to someone.
1915460	1916460	I think they could...
1916460	1917460	I don't know.
1917460	1918460	It's up to you.
1918460	1921460	Otherwise, you know, I do want to talk to some other people.
1921460	1922460	Okay.
1922460	1924460	And if I have to go to the New York Times to interview him.
1924460	1925460	In Andrew.
1925460	1926460	That's when I'll ask.
1926460	1927460	Okay.
1927460	1930460	So, my own documents are the key to all of this.
1930460	1932460	Fragrant loan documents in my point of view.
1932460	1935460	And I'm talking about in terms of what I'm covering.
1935460	1937460	But I also think in the larger story.
1937460	1942460	So, the only way I can manage to do this in terms of the way I can understand it.
1942460	1944460	Because I don't understand why David walked out.
1944460	1946460	There's multiple reasons why I could have walked out.
1946460	1947460	We'll go over it with you.
1947460	1948460	So, we're going to go over it.
1948460	1951460	And I normally wouldn't do this, but I'm going to do that.
1951460	1954460	Because I don't know what transpired.
1954460	1955460	I need context.
1955460	1956460	And I'm going to ask David.
1956460	1957460	For the same context.
1957460	1958460	Okay.
1958460	1959460	And I'll go over it with him too.
1959460	1960460	If he needs to.
1960460	1961460	But he has a recording.
1961460	1962460	So, I don't take it.
1962460	1963460	Thank you.
1963460	1964460	That's correct.
1964460	1965460	The question.
1965460	1968460	So, did I miss you saying you're going to go to New York to interview him?
1968460	1969460	If I have to.
1969460	1971460	I mean, he said, you know, I asked if I could interview him.
1971460	1972460	He said he would.
1972460	1975460	But maybe it would be best if we do it back in the New York Times building.
1975460	1977460	With the PR team there.
1977460	1981460	Or at least maybe he didn't say with PR team that he's going to check with the PR team.
1981460	1983460	I actually would like the PR team there.
1983460	1984460	Yeah?
1984460	1985460	Yeah.
1985460	1987460	I don't really have like 10 questions.
1987460	1988460	Right.
1988460	1993460	I need you to help me decipher some of this.
1993460	1997460	Because the relationship between you and David and what they're going to edit out most likely.
1997460	1999460	Because it doesn't make sense without context.
1999460	2000460	I need context on.
2000460	2004460	So, that's to me why this is a, you know.
2004460	2006460	Another thing.
2006460	2012460	You have your own issues in the New York Times.
2012460	2013460	No, I don't.
2013460	2014460	Really?
2014460	2015460	No.
2015460	2022460	I think until there's evidence that, no, I said other women had issues with the reporting
2022460	2023460	that she did.
2023460	2024460	A lot of women.
2024460	2025460	I don't know.
2025460	2026460	I'm confused.
2026460	2027460	I'm confused.
2027460	2028460	Yeah.
2028460	2031460	That's separate from this.
2031460	2033460	And that's like, I'm not going to bring that up there.
2033460	2034460	No, of course not.
2034460	2035460	I'm just.
2035460	2036460	I'm just.
2036460	2038460	I mean, like every New York Times every day, like I think most people do.
2038460	2039460	They won't ban you.
2039460	2040460	That's what you're saying.
2040460	2041460	They're not going to ban you from venturing.
2041460	2042460	I don't mean if they do.
2042460	2043460	I hope they do.
2043460	2044460	I hope somebody bans me.
2044460	2046460	Everything like, you know, like why not?
2046460	2049460	But so yeah, we're going to review this because I need you to help me decipher.
2049460	2050460	Okay.
2050460	2057460	What went down by David left some things on the first day, which I don't think they're
2057460	2058460	going to air much of.
2058460	2059460	They pretty much said that.
2059460	2060460	Did they?
2060460	2065460	Oh, they said like they said M being there was an issue.
2065460	2068460	Maybe that's the makeup.
2069460	2070460	I don't know.
2070460	2072460	Nobody is going to.
2072460	2074460	That's that's that's just talk.
2074460	2075460	Nobody knows yet.
2075460	2077460	Nobody knows but when are they supposed to air?
2077460	2078460	I don't know.
2078460	2079460	I don't know.
2079460	2085460	This is March 18th or a little more possibly, but that's what gets the problems in March
2085460	2086460	18th.
2086460	2089460	He said the guests off the top said you heard the conversation.
2089460	2092460	That means there must be another story coming out about fc.
2092460	2095460	We don't know because you can't say that for sure.
2095460	2099460	But you said that he would tell the story of NFC from the book.
2099460	2101460	So there's a couple possibilities.
2101460	2102460	Okay, okay, okay.
2102460	2113460	Is that the way he presented the thing to us, he said, it will start with David and Barbados.
2113460	2115460	David and Barbados?
2115460	2117460	Who started with David?
2117460	2118460	Who started with David and Barbados?
2118460	2120460	That's what Eric said to us on the phone.
2120460	2121460	Eric, who?
2121460	2122460	The producer.
2122460	2124460	Oh, what?
2124460	2126460	No, and the guy, what's his name?
2126460	2128460	The fucking guy from the dating.
2128460	2129460	Why would he be in Barbados?
2129460	2130460	No, it's not Barbados.
2130460	2133460	The name of the guy that is the David podcast...
2133460	2134460	Oh, Barbaro.
2134460	2135460	Barbaro.
2135460	2137460	Well, the arm is here.
2137460	2139460	Well, I...
2139460	2141460	You're thinking, oh my god, John McAfee.
2141460	2142460	I'm thinking...
2142460	2144460	No, I'm not thinking John McAfee.
2144460	2146460	I'm thinking Barbados.
2146460	2149460	That's another thing.
2149460	2151460	That he will introduce that.
2151460	2152460	Yes, yes.
2152460	2154460	But we don't know for sure.
2154460	2156460	We can say a lot of shit.
2156460	2159460	You know what I said David wasn't coming here to talk about?
2159460	2160460	David.
2160460	2161460	Yeah.
2161460	2162460	And then he said a lot of bullshit.
2162460	2163460	How many did he say?
2163460	2165460	He wants two videos.
2165460	2169460	Listen, nobody knows until the footage is put together.
2169460	2173460	And you have to understand, like, here's my thing.
2173460	2177460	It's like, I want to shoot you listening to whatever they put together for the daily.
2177460	2180460	So whenever that happens, I got to send Ellington over here just to shoot that.
2180460	2181460	You know what I'm saying?
2181460	2182460	We can report it.
2182460	2183460	We can do it here, Kevin.
2183460	2185460	Yeah, but no, I need to have it the same.
2185460	2188460	Like, I'm trying to up the standard for this kind of shit, you know?
2188460	2196460	And another thing I thought as I got to tonight was cancelled is that if we do the podcast with Scott, you should be there.
2196460	2202460	Well, I wanted to film it, but I just had a miscommunication on the phone with you.
2202460	2204460	I really thought that you guys didn't want us to...
2204460	2206460	I think we wanted a break, which I totally...
2206460	2208460	I mean, the crew needed a break, too.
2208460	2210460	We didn't need a break.
2210460	2212460	That's my miscommunication.
2212460	2214460	Then I totally...
2214460	2216460	If I would have...
2216460	2217460	I had him booked.
2217460	2220460	I'd rather than be here right now, but it's fine.
2220460	2221460	It's actually worked out.
2221460	2222460	It worked out.
2222460	2223460	It worked out.
2223460	2224460	And then while we're...
2224460	2227460	I have some questions, so I'm going to stop this when I do.
2227460	2231460	And that's why we're doing this, because I don't understand some of this stuff.
2231460	2232460	Okay.
2232460	2233460	But...
2233460	2236460	Because I need context for your and David's relationship.
2236460	2237460	Okay?
2237460	2238460	Now, hold on.
2238460	2239460	Hold on.
2239460	2240460	Hold on.
2240460	2241460	Let me pause it.
2241460	2242460	Oh, wait.
2242460	2244460	There's even going to be a volume through this.
2244460	2245460	You look fantastic, though.
2245460	2246460	I look like an idiot.
2246460	2247460	Come on. Here you go.
2247460	2248460	I got it.
2248460	2249460	I got it.
2249460	2250460	You look so hot.
2250460	2252460	I'm going to go with 1964 Southern...
2252460	2253460	No, you do.
2253460	2254460	That's why you look cool.
2254460	2255460	You look so hot.
2255460	2256460	I'm just outside.
2256460	2259460	You guys should be handing out flyers in Baptist Southern Louisiana.
2259460	2260460	What the fuck?
2260460	2261460	That's kind of fun.
2261460	2262460	Is there no volume?
2262460	2264460	Because this is going through this now.
2264460	2265460	1964.
2265460	2268460	I'm just telling you, I'm good at this.
2268460	2269460	Thank you.
2269460	2270460	What?
2270460	2271460	That's all you need to say.
2271460	2272460	Thank you.
2272460	2273460	You said pretty sweet.
2273460	2274460	Yes, sir.
2274460	2275460	No, I don't.
2275460	2276460	Thank you.
2276460	2277460	Thank you.
2277460	2278460	Thank you.
2278460	2279460	All right.
2279460	2280460	Stupid.
2280460	2281460	It's not working.
2281460	2282460	Oh, wait.
2282460	2283460	I mean, him next to David...
2283460	2287460	I don't think it's going to work through the sound, maybe.
2287460	2290460	I think I have to put it through here.
2290460	2292460	You can't air drop the sound out.
2292460	2294460	Oh, can I air drop it through there?
2294460	2295460	Oh.
2295460	2296460	Oh, yeah.
2296460	2297460	Oh, there you go.
2297460	2298460	Yeah, I used that.
2298460	2299460	I built a mirror in Samsung.
2299460	2300460	I think I made it in Samsung.
2300460	2301460	Oh, that'll do it, too.
2301460	2302460	Well, I had it on that.
2302460	2303460	I had it on a mirror.
2303460	2304460	Oh, you did?
2304460	2305460	Oh, maybe it's the other one.
2305460	2310460	The only worst case scenario which I'm afraid of is that they won't play it.
2310460	2311460	Yeah, exactly.
2311460	2312460	Do you think that's possible?
2312460	2313460	I think it's possible.
2313460	2314460	What's the code for Apple TV?
2314460	2315460	I'm sorry.
2315460	2316460	It should show up on your phone somewhere.
2316460	2317460	Let me see.
2317460	2318460	I'm just going to hit...
2318460	2319460	Apple TV code.
2319460	2322460	I have to bring up the app, right?
2322460	2323460	I don't know.
2323460	2326460	Because I think it's going to play the sound through the TV.
2326460	2327460	No, you don't need...
2327460	2329460	That's because you're going through the Apple TV.
2329460	2332460	No, I've just tried all the different outputs for sound.
2332460	2333460	Yeah.
2333460	2336460	For some reason, I don't think the HDMI is carrying it.
2336460	2339460	Or try Bikki TV.
2339460	2340460	Bikki TV.
2340460	2341460	Bikki TV.
2341460	2342460	Bikki TV.
2342460	2343460	Bikki TV.
2343460	2344460	Bikki TV.
2344460	2345460	Bikki TV.
2345460	2346460	Bikki TV.
2346460	2347460	Bikki TV.
2347460	2348460	Bikki TV.
2348460	2349460	Yeah.
2349460	2350460	That's the Apple TV.
2350460	2352460	Can I try the other...
2352460	2354460	Let's just play it through here.
2354460	2355460	Can I play?
2355460	2356460	Here.
2356460	2357460	The whole point is the sound.
2357460	2359460	I want to hear how we did the sound.
2359460	2360460	Yeah, but...
2360460	2361460	I don't have the sound.
2361460	2362460	I don't have the audio.
2362460	2363460	This is not Eric's audio.
2363460	2365460	This is from the onboard mic on the camera.
2365460	2366460	Gotcha.
2369460	2370460	That's terrible.
2370460	2372460	Oh, we just plugged the speakers in there.
2372460	2373460	Yeah, yeah.
2373460	2374460	If you have an output, yeah.
2374460	2375460	That works.
2375460	2376460	Give me the...
2376460	2377460	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2382460	2383460	Oh, shit.
2383460	2384460	Do you have that...
2384460	2385460	That kind of plug?
2385460	2386460	Mm-hmm.
2386460	2387460	Good.
2389460	2390460	Bill Maher.
2390460	2391460	I miss Bill Maher.
2391460	2392460	I love Bill Maher.
2392460	2393460	I've got him recently.
2393460	2394460	He did?
2394460	2395460	What'd he do?
2395460	2396460	Just like...
2396460	2397460	What'd he say?
2397460	2398460	What the fuck?
2399460	2400460	What did he say?
2400460	2403460	He didn't challenge Ben on the show
2403460	2404460	the last time he was on.
2404460	2406460	Sometimes it's just too high.
2407460	2408460	Bill Maher?
2408460	2409460	Bill Maher.
2409460	2410460	Is it who the guy is?
2411460	2412460	Headphone.
2412460	2414460	Sometimes it's too high as well.
2414460	2415460	Is it 10?
2415460	2416460	This isn't working.
2417460	2418460	Oh, I need this.
2418460	2419460	I need a headphone.
2419460	2420460	Here, I got it.
2420460	2421460	I have it, I have it.
2421460	2422460	I think that's the...
2422460	2423460	No, I got it.
2423460	2424460	That's your aunt.
2424460	2425460	No, no, no.
2425460	2426460	Okay.
2426460	2427460	They should have plugged in.
2427460	2428460	They might not be plugged in.
2428460	2429460	Is it not plugged in?
2429460	2430460	Yeah, here we go.
2430460	2431460	I think they have to be powered.
2431460	2432460	Yeah, it's not plugged in.
2432460	2433460	Oh, okay.
2433460	2434460	Yeah, yeah.
2435460	2438460	Bill Maher always the same people coming on.
2438460	2439460	I know.
2439460	2440460	So it's like, okay.
2442460	2444460	But, you know, I love Bill Maher.
2444460	2445460	You can't...
2445460	2447460	I want him to go on Bill Maher.
2447460	2448460	Yeah, what's his name?
2448460	2449460	He'll get us on the show.
2449460	2452460	Okay, and I have your word.
2452460	2454460	You're not going to leak audio.
2454460	2455460	This is for reviewing with me.
2455460	2456460	Because I know you're recording.
2456460	2457460	Okay.
2457460	2458460	And I'm taking that chance.
2458460	2459460	But I am...
2459460	2463460	On the type almost, on my son's...
2463460	2464460	And I...
2464460	2467460	Wait, just can you stop bouncing stuff on your son's life?
2467460	2468460	That's ridiculous.
2468460	2469460	On my life.
2469460	2470460	Thank you.
2470460	2471460	Fair enough.
2471460	2472460	Because I mean, no one hurts you guys if you do it.
2472460	2473460	Okay.
2473460	2474460	Ready?
2474460	2475460	Please.
2475460	2476460	Marie, Marie, can you just stop and eat?
2476460	2477460	I am, I am.
2477460	2478460	Good grief.
2478460	2479460	Both of you.
2480460	2481460	Gosh.
2482460	2483460	At least you make me laugh.
2483460	2484460	You guys are hilarious.
2484460	2485460	All right.
2485460	2486460	Was it funny?
2486460	2487460	Yeah.
2487460	2488460	It's not funny.
2488460	2489460	I'm just going to have a look at the court record.
2489460	2490460	Go ahead.
2490460	2491460	There you go.
2491460	2492460	There you go.
2492460	2494460	Damn, it's live, Sarah.
2494460	2495460	Ah.
2495460	2498460	Sounds like you're plugging in your guitar, Val.
2498460	2499460	Yeah.
2499460	2500460	It does actually.
2500460	2501460	By the way, those amps, they're good.
2501460	2502460	Yeah.
2502460	2503460	Apologize?
2503460	2504460	That's right.
2504460	2505460	Work it out.
2505460	2506460	Sometimes apologies went down.
2506460	2508460	I mean, let's put this in context.
2508460	2509460	You...
2509460	2511460	He just apologized to you.
2511460	2515460	And I think we have that, but it's on a different card.
2515460	2516460	Okay.
2516460	2517460	Well, I want to see that.
2518460	2519460	Well, we have it.
2519460	2522460	Literally, he says you apologize, and we switched.
2522460	2524460	Like, it has two cards in it, and it switches over.
2524460	2526460	And I couldn't find...
2526460	2528460	Like, I would have to scrub through all the shit to do that,
2528460	2530460	and, like, it would have taken me another hour.
2530460	2532460	Like, it's just because it's at the very end,
2532460	2534460	right before the end, and I didn't know where it was.
2534460	2535460	Damage is done.
2535460	2537460	There's irrevocable damage.
2537460	2540460	It's really difficult to...
2540460	2543460	It's really difficult to just sit there and say,
2543460	2545460	Oh, what a lovely apology.
2545460	2546460	Thank you.
2546460	2547460	Listen to me for it.
2547460	2550460	But no, when lives are ruined, because what David did was...
2550460	2552460	It's called a character assassination.
2552460	2554460	He went on, and he tried to assassinate him.
2554460	2556460	He tried to murder him.
2556460	2562460	Now, I have been ruminating on as to why for many, many a day.
2562460	2565460	And I came up with a few ideas.
2565460	2567460	The one being the one I think I already brought up
2567460	2570460	was to discredit me so that you can take this book
2570460	2572460	and say, I did all this to myself.
2572460	2574460	You know, and if I ever jump up and say,
2574460	2576460	Hey, that's not true. I did this.
2576460	2578460	And then you can just, oh, that's just drug,
2578460	2579460	that's just drug addict Val.
2579460	2580460	Don't listen to him.
2580460	2582460	He's the credit card-thieving guy
2582460	2585460	that's out for, that would sell his own fucking father
2585460	2586460	for a movie deal.
2586460	2587460	Oh, you fucker.
2587460	2590460	I just can't believe you went that low.
2590460	2592460	I still can't, I've never really bothered you.
2592460	2593460	Incincidentally...
2593460	2594460	But I don't let me go on a tangent.
2594460	2595460	I'm sorry.
2595460	2596460	No, I'm cutting you.
2596460	2597460	No.
2597460	2598460	Incincidentally enough.
2598460	2599460	No.
2599460	2601460	Because it's annoying.
2601460	2603460	I wasn't really pissed off.
2603460	2604460	No, it was good.
2604460	2605460	You went through my head.
2605460	2606460	You were really pissed.
2606460	2607460	I had the thought.
2607460	2608460	I had the thought.
2608460	2610460	Oh, please, both of you are joining me crazy.
2610460	2611460	You're talkers.
2611460	2612460	The two of you together.
2612460	2613460	Oh, and you're not a fucking talker?
2613460	2615460	You're just pissed because you can't, you know,
2615460	2616460	talk over brother-in-law.
2616460	2617460	There's a question.
2617460	2618460	So I say something.
2618460	2619460	I went to the jump sign.
2619460	2620460	Please, look at me.
2620460	2621460	It's a big one.
2621460	2622460	It's a stereo now.
2622460	2623460	Okay.
2623460	2624460	I was so angry.
2624460	2626460	I had the thought that you're standing up
2626460	2627460	and punching me in the face.
2627460	2628460	No.
2628460	2629460	I was thinking about that.
2629460	2630460	No.
2630460	2632460	And then I thought that was a bad idea,
2632460	2633460	like you're saying, obviously.
2633460	2635460	Because it was on camera.
2635460	2636460	I was that angry.
2636460	2637460	Like, I don't even fight.
2637460	2639460	I don't even fight in the light.
2639460	2640460	And you know what it is.
2640460	2641460	So I was 23.
2641460	2642460	Did you fail?
2642460	2643460	I felt it.
2643460	2644460	No.
2644460	2646460	Nobody wants to work with you.
2646460	2647460	Nobody does, right?
2647460	2648460	No.
2648460	2649460	I get to...
2649460	2651460	When I read you and David,
2651460	2654460	and I remember you saying the article
2654460	2656460	would change your life.
2656460	2657460	Oh, God.
2657460	2658460	How many times did you say that?
2658460	2659460	Oh, God.
2659460	2661460	The article, your life's going to change.
2661460	2662460	Oh, make me a star.
2662460	2664460	You're going to make me a star.
2664460	2665460	I remember that...
2665460	2666460	Yes, you did say that.
2666460	2667460	That was funny.
2667460	2668460	Thank you.
2668460	2669460	And then...
2669460	2671460	Marie, what happened to all your friends?
2671460	2675460	I've been humiliated at school.
2675460	2677460	I mean, people don't want to...
2677460	2678460	You know, I was mad.
2678460	2680460	They don't want to come here.
2680460	2681460	Is that true, Marla?
2681460	2683460	I'm really sorry to hear that.
2683460	2684460	He said that.
2684460	2685460	Yeah.
2685460	2687460	We've had a...
2687460	2690460	You don't deserve any of this, Marla.
2690460	2693460	Yeah, but that has nothing to do with the whole conversation.
2693460	2694460	Yeah, but...
2694460	2695460	It does, Marla.
2695460	2697460	Yeah, it does, but...
2697460	2698460	I do.
2698460	2700460	And I'll tell you what.
2700460	2704460	If someone had done something that I felt harmed one of my kids,
2704460	2708460	the reaction I would have would be vicious and angry,
2708460	2710460	and I would do anything that would protect my kids.
2710460	2712460	So, if what you're saying is true,
2712460	2714460	but has affected his life,
2714460	2716460	I would have a very horrible reaction to it.
2716460	2719460	Well, that's why I'm in a horrible reaction here.
2719460	2721460	No, I get that.
2721460	2722460	I hear you.
2722460	2724460	Okay, you have a horrible reaction.
2724460	2726460	I don't feel any sincerity, but...
2726460	2728460	Well, part of it...
2728460	2731460	Can I just say, Marie, it's a little rich to say,
2731460	2734460	I'm not showing enough feeling when you blindside me
2734460	2737460	by having a camera crew here to record it.
2737460	2741460	I'm being very careful about the facial expressions I use,
2741460	2744460	being very cognizant of the fact that there's a camera recording this.
2745460	2747460	So, you see what happens here?
2747460	2749460	So, it's really you. It's Huey Hayes.
2749460	2752460	And, Roko, I must tell you,
2752460	2754460	there's something very important.
2754460	2757460	Three days after the article was published,
2757460	2759460	I called his wife,
2759460	2764460	and I told her all four consequences
2764460	2767460	in my son's life,
2767460	2769460	in Marla's life and my life.
2769460	2771460	And she says, oh, really?
2771460	2776460	He's in a valve like that.
2776460	2778460	I said, do you know since that article?
2778460	2780460	And you're referring to the...
2780460	2784460	To the article and drug addiction and mischaracterization.
2784460	2785460	I said, good question.
2785460	2787460	Had your husband yelled at you at the...
2787460	2788460	Or yelled at Val?
2788460	2789460	That was later.
2789460	2790460	That was later.
2790460	2792460	PTA, okay.
2792460	2794460	I thought that maybe had happened already too.
2794460	2795460	No, that was...
2795460	2797460	You're going to teach your conference.
2797460	2799460	Can you imagine?
2799460	2803460	And so that he pretends to be surprised
2803460	2806460	is even more alive.
2806460	2808460	He's known that since October.
2808460	2810460	And there's not nothing.
2810460	2811460	Nothing, nothing.
2811460	2813460	Even I called his wife because he didn't know my text.
2813460	2815460	He would not answer my text.
2815460	2816460	Nothing.
2816460	2819460	I said, David, what you've done is affecting my son.
2819460	2821460	You are a father.
2821460	2823460	Why have you done this?
2823460	2825460	Do you know that I'm...
2825460	2828460	Val is not alone in the fucking desert.
2828460	2829460	You know?
2829460	2831460	In the vacuum inside it, right?
2831460	2832460	Yeah.
2832460	2833460	But he...
2833460	2834460	He knows.
2834460	2837460	So this is also important to put this...
2837460	2840460	I don't know, somehow we can explain that.
2840460	2841460	David pretends to...
2841460	2843460	Oh, this is new information.
2843460	2844460	Is that true?
2844460	2847460	He's like, of course he's going to do that.
2847460	2849460	He's trying to look good, right?
2849460	2851460	So he's going to take the...
2851460	2854460	Generally the opposition is stronger to him.
2854460	2856460	So he's going to go with the flow
2856460	2858460	in the sense where he's just going to say,
2858460	2860460	if you start agreeing with us...
2860460	2861460	Right now it's not...
2861460	2864460	It's advantageous for him to give in a little bit, right?
2864460	2867460	But what's strange is that he is now attacking you.
2867460	2869460	You're saying, well, that's rich coming from you.
2869460	2871460	Rich means, like, that's bullshit.
2871460	2873460	Like, how hypocritical.
2873460	2874460	I am hypocritical?
2874460	2876460	Yeah, it's calling you hypocritical.
2876460	2877460	Why?
2877460	2878460	That's what...
2878460	2880460	Every time you talk, you're working so much,
2880460	2882460	and he flips out, you know?
2882460	2885460	You see, it's something about you that you're like...
2885460	2886460	Not about you, sorry.
2886460	2887460	It's about...
2887460	2888460	Is that you?
2888460	2890460	Like, you know, personally or something?
2890460	2891460	Well, it obviously is me.
2891460	2892460	Yeah.
2892460	2893460	No, no.
2893460	2894460	Because they're rich doing...
2894460	2896460	It's something, yeah.
2896460	2897460	I call it bullshit.
2897460	2898460	You do.
2898460	2901460	But there's something that he's always...
2901460	2902460	Yes.
2902460	2904460	Because he didn't see this now.
2904460	2905460	So he asked the other day,
2905460	2907460	no, it doesn't matter what has happened.
2907460	2908460	It was terrible, and that's...
2908460	2909460	Well...
2909460	2910460	So why...
2910460	2913460	So I am making...
2913460	2915460	I was lying about...
2915460	2916460	I know.
2916460	2919460	So you think I don't know?
2919460	2922460	So I'm making...
2922460	2924460	You're driving nuts.
2924460	2925460	Yeah.
2925460	2926460	But...
2926460	2927460	Let's compare with me.
2927460	2928460	It's just my prisons.
2928460	2929460	I think so.
2929460	2930460	Yeah.
2930460	2931460	And you look...
2931460	2932460	Because we talked about it the other night.
2932460	2933460	Something about women.
2933460	2934460	He's the only woman.
2934460	2936460	He's not good with them.
2936460	2939460	He's got, you know,
2939460	2942460	history with bad behavior, you know?
2942460	2943460	So, yeah.
2943460	2945460	And he says I'm being rich like I'm...
2945460	2947460	No, rich is not critical.
2947460	2948460	Right?
2948460	2950460	It's not what being rich means in America.
2950460	2951460	Okay, wait.
2951460	2952460	That's not on me.
2952460	2953460	That's on you guys.
2953460	2955460	I forget this is a girl, right?
2955460	2956460	Well, look, I did not trust you.
2956460	2957460	I did not trust you.
2957460	2958460	That's fine.
2958460	2959460	And I'm not...
2959460	2960460	The camera's here, and I've...
2960460	2961460	Can you hear that just one more time?
2961460	2962460	I don't know what he's saying.
2962460	2964460	He says he's being hypocritical about it.
2964460	2967460	Did I hear it for you first of all?
2967460	2968460	In English?
2968460	2969460	I would have...
2969460	2970460	But remember this.
2970460	2972460	This is why also,
2972460	2974460	I feel that this is disingenuous
2974460	2976460	in that he says that the camera crew
2976460	2977460	have got a camera crew here.
2977460	2978460	And I've told him three times,
2978460	2979460	I'm not with Val.
2979460	2980460	I will leave.
2980460	2982460	I offered to leave,
2982460	2986460	which jeopardized and risked me with you.
2986460	2989460	Like, you could have walked because I said that, right?
2989460	2992460	But there was no other fair way to do it in my eyes.
2992460	2994460	I'm just putting it in context.
2994460	2995460	But remember, Rocco,
2995460	2998460	is that if he says Val, you buy a camera crew.
2998460	3000460	That means that it's something he can use against me.
3000460	3002460	If you come independently on your own,
3002460	3003460	he can't use it against me.
3003460	3004460	Exactly.
3004460	3005460	That's why he says to you,
3005460	3006460	as much as Val's...
3006460	3007460	Right.
3007460	3008460	He incriminates you.
3008460	3009460	Okay.
3009460	3010460	Right.
3010460	3011460	So, okay.
3011460	3012460	Not incriminating.
3012460	3013460	It's just like,
3013460	3015460	something he can use against me.
3015460	3016460	You can't say,
3016460	3018460	Rocco came up independently on his shelf,
3018460	3019460	but you don't.
3019460	3020460	You do a thing.
3020460	3021460	Which is what happened.
3021460	3022460	If he says that,
3022460	3023460	it doesn't sound good, right?
3023460	3024460	No, right.
3024460	3025460	All right.
3025460	3026460	Let's hear it.
3026460	3027460	Very horrible reaction to him.
3027460	3030460	Well, that's why I'm not in a horrible reaction here.
3030460	3032460	No, I get that.
3032460	3033460	I hear you.
3033460	3034460	Okay.
3034460	3035460	You guys are in a horrible reaction.
3035460	3037460	I don't feel any sincerity, but...
3037460	3038460	Well, look.
3038460	3039460	Part of...
3039460	3040460	Can I just say, Marie,
3040460	3042460	it's a little rich to say,
3042460	3045460	I'm not showing enough feeling when you blindside me
3045460	3048460	by having a camera crew here to record it.
3048460	3050460	I'm being very careful
3050460	3052460	about the facial expressions I use,
3052460	3053460	being very cognizant of the fact
3053460	3055460	that there's a camera recording this.
3055460	3056460	And that's not on me.
3056460	3057460	That's on you guys.
3057460	3059460	I forget that there's a camera, right?
3059460	3060460	Well, look.
3060460	3061460	I did not trust you.
3061460	3062460	I did not trust you.
3062460	3063460	That's fine.
3063460	3064460	And I'm not...
3064460	3065460	The camera's here,
3065460	3066460	and I've given my permission for the camera.
3066460	3067460	They're not here for you, first of all.
3067460	3068460	Well...
3068460	3069460	They're doing a thing about me,
3069460	3071460	and you happen to be part of my life story right now.
3071460	3072460	Is that so?
3072460	3073460	Okay?
3073460	3074460	It's not...
3074460	3076460	I only bring up the camera in the context of,
3076460	3078460	if you feel like I'm not exhibiting enough emotion
3078460	3079460	or senior sincere,
3079460	3080460	that's probably a something...
3080460	3081460	That's not what she's saying.
3081460	3082460	That's not what she's saying.
3082460	3083460	That's not what she's saying.
3083460	3084460	That's not what she's saying.
3084460	3085460	I'm sorry.
3085460	3086460	And that's it.
3086460	3087460	And I appreciate it.
3087460	3088460	No, I felt it.
3088460	3089460	He made me...
3089460	3090460	I didn't appreciate it.
3090460	3091460	I felt it.
3091460	3092460	I think he meant it.
3092460	3093460	He said sorry.
3093460	3094460	I think he meant his apology.
3094460	3095460	I just don't think he understands
3095460	3097460	the gravity of what he's done.
3097460	3100460	And I think this is why I wanted him to know.
3100460	3101460	I want him to see it.
3101460	3103460	I want to show, not tell.
3103460	3104460	Okay?
3104460	3106460	The fiction is one major thing.
3106460	3109460	Her friend, my Marie's friends,
3109460	3111460	I mean, could you really call them friends, though?
3111460	3112460	I mean, could you call them friends?
3112460	3113460	No, Marie, could you call them...
3113460	3114460	No, no, no, please.
3114460	3116460	I mean, these people are terrible anyway.
3116460	3117460	Yes.
3117460	3118460	You know, fuck them.
3118460	3120460	But it's not that.
3120460	3121460	It's Marlo.
3121460	3122460	Because this is a...
3122460	3124460	You have two kids, so you know it's like
3124460	3126460	going to school, having play dates,
3126460	3128460	and kids playing with other kids, right?
3128460	3129460	Yep.
3129460	3130460	You know the parents interact with each other.
3130460	3131460	It's a social thing.
3131460	3132460	Yep.
3132460	3133460	Right?
3133460	3135460	So when a parent is ostracized,
3135460	3137460	the kid is ostracized.
3137460	3140460	Yeah, I definitely know what you mean.
3140460	3142460	And that breaks my heart to hear that.
3142460	3143460	And never before that.
3143460	3145460	But that is a direct consequence of your act.
3145460	3147460	Well, that makes me feel awful.
3147460	3149460	Well, I'm glad you did.
3149460	3151460	It makes me feel awful.
3151460	3152460	Look, the...
3152460	3153460	But I have a few choices.
3153460	3154460	You can do something about it,
3154460	3155460	but you cannot do anything about it.
3155460	3156460	What would you like me to do?
3156460	3158460	What I would like you to do is I'd like you
3158460	3160460	to rewrite this problem.
3160460	3162460	You'd like me to rewrite the article?
3162460	3163460	Yeah.
3163460	3164460	Well, that's not really the way we roll.
3164460	3165460	I mean, I don't care.
3165460	3166460	I don't care how you roll.
3166460	3167460	This is what I like.
3167460	3168460	You ask me what I like.
3169460	3171460	I would like you to...
3171460	3172460	I don't know.
3172460	3173460	I'd like you to keep going.
3173460	3174460	I'd like you to rewrite the article.
3174460	3176460	I'd like you to make a statement.
3176460	3177460	A...
3177460	3178460	Marlo.
3178460	3179460	Because this is a...
3179460	3180460	You have two kids,
3180460	3182460	so you know it's like going to school,
3182460	3183460	having play dates,
3183460	3185460	and kids playing with other kids, right?
3185460	3186460	Yep.
3186460	3187460	You know the parents interact with each other,
3187460	3188460	so it's a social thing.
3188460	3189460	Yep.
3189460	3190460	Right?
3190460	3192460	So when a parent is ostracized,
3192460	3193460	the kid is ostracized.
3193460	3194460	Get money from Ray Van.
3194460	3195460	Yay!
3195460	3196460	Sponsorship.
3196460	3197460	You know, I was on a boat with McAfee,
3197460	3198460	and he stole my Ray Vans.
3198460	3199460	He wouldn't give them back to me,
3199460	3201460	and he said the same fucking thing.
3201460	3202460	Really?
3202460	3203460	That's weird.
3203460	3204460	And Ray Van was a sponsor,
3204460	3205460	so I'm sure they enjoyed it,
3205460	3206460	but it never aired, so...
3206460	3207460	What's your status?
3207460	3208460	We'll call Ray Van.
3208460	3209460	Yeah, I...
3209460	3210460	I definitely know what you mean,
3210460	3212460	and that breaks my heart to hear that.
3212460	3213460	And never before.
3213460	3215460	But that is a direct consequence of your act.
3215460	3217460	Well, that makes me feel awful.
3217460	3218460	Well, I'm glad.
3218460	3219460	Who is Nengar?
3219460	3220460	You're right.
3220460	3221460	It makes me feel awful.
3221460	3222460	I am...
3222460	3223460	Look, I have a few choices.
3223460	3224460	You can do something about it,
3224460	3225460	or you can not.
3225460	3226460	What would you like me to do?
3226460	3228460	What I would like you to do is
3228460	3230460	I'd like you to rewrite this properly.
3230460	3232460	You'd like me to rewrite the article?
3232460	3233460	Yeah.
3233460	3235460	Well, that's not really the way to do it.
3235460	3237460	I don't care how you roll.
3237460	3238460	This is what I like.
3238460	3239460	You ask me what I would like.
3239460	3240460	I would like you...
3240460	3242460	I would like you to rewrite the article.
3242460	3244460	I would like you to make a statement,
3244460	3246460	a public fucking apology.
3246460	3247460	Not on Twitter.
3247460	3249460	Make it a little more public than that.
3249460	3250460	Well, Val,
3250460	3254460	I would like you to go over your own fucking article,
3254460	3256460	or forensically like I did,
3256460	3258460	and say this is where I was wrong.
3258460	3259460	This is where I was right.
3259460	3261460	This is where I apologize for it.
3261460	3263460	This is what I've done.
3263460	3264460	I would like you to say,
3264460	3265460	you know what?
3265460	3266460	I was careless with people.
3266460	3268460	I was careless with my source.
3268460	3270460	I was careless with my friend.
3270460	3271460	I was careless.
3271460	3272460	I fucked up.
3272460	3274460	And I didn't think about
3274460	3275460	how this would affect other people.
3275460	3277460	I didn't realize that I, David,
3277460	3280460	had a voice that few people do.
3280460	3281460	And that's the New York Times.
3281460	3283460	And this is not just a rinky-dinky paper
3283460	3286460	in the middle of fucking Swaziland.
3286460	3288460	This is the New York Times.
3288460	3290460	And to put a character assassination piece
3290460	3293460	on the front of the fucking New York Times, man.
3293460	3295460	There's a lot of power.
3295460	3297460	And you wielded that power,
3297460	3299460	very carelessly,
3299460	3302460	out of your own self fucking interest.
3302460	3304460	I disagree with that last one.
3304460	3306460	Let me finish my sentence now.
3306460	3308460	You wielded that power against me
3308460	3310460	in a very selfish way.
3310460	3311460	And carelessly.
3311460	3313460	Because you were angry at me.
3313460	3315460	You did not consider the effects
3315460	3319460	that they would have on me, Marie,
3319460	3321460	and Marlo in our lives.
3321460	3324460	You were just filled with anger and rage.
3324460	3325460	And you took it out on me.
3325460	3327460	And the best way you knew how,
3327460	3328460	I said fuck that.
3328460	3329460	I got him out.
3329460	3330460	New York Times.
3330460	3333460	But you didn't consider how that would work.
3333460	3334460	You know what?
3334460	3336460	What's frightening means that you did consider that.
3336460	3338460	And you knew what the consequences would be.
3338460	3340460	That's what scares me.
3340460	3342460	And that's why I had to double down the others.
3342460	3345460	And this is just part one.
3345460	3348460	It's your imagination at school.
3348460	3350460	We went to...
3350460	3352460	Sorry, that was for vote here.
3352460	3353460	No, I'm sorry.
3353460	3357460	We went most recently to a parent-teacher conference.
3357460	3360460	And my future ex-husband
3360460	3364460	starts quoting you and asking Val to leave.
3365460	3366460	Yeah.
3371460	3374460	Screaming at him in front of everybody.
3374460	3376460	And he had to leave.
3376460	3379460	And he leaves half the time with Marlo.
3379460	3380460	He couldn't stay.
3380460	3381460	How could he stay?
3381460	3383460	Well, the New York Times was wrong.
3383460	3384460	I'm going to leave.
3388460	3389460	The New York Times?
3389460	3390460	It must be true.
3390460	3391460	Yes.
3391460	3392460	That's what we get.
3392460	3395460	And Dragon Age and all of this.
3395460	3398460	He's been going for a long time.
3398460	3402460	You don't know what I mean.
3402460	3406460	What we mean is that you're a part of the New York Times.
3406460	3408460	You're a part of his life.
3408460	3412460	Which means you could also be famous.
3412460	3414460	It could also be cool.
3414460	3418460	But just don't think about others too.
3418460	3421460	You're in the New York Times.
3421460	3424460	Because because you're part of his life,
3424460	3426460	the council is you.
3426460	3428460	You're right, Marlo.
3428460	3429460	Think about others too.
3429460	3433460	And you are right that it's really important to consider
3433460	3436460	and remember the power that the Times wields.
3436460	3439460	And especially when it's writing about the things that people...
3439460	3440460	You're right.
3440460	3442460	But David, there's a power in there.
3442460	3444460	I know what you did to me.
3444460	3449460	I thought it was just a nasty thing between us.
3449460	3452460	But then I asked around a bit.
3452460	3454460	And that wasn't the first one.
3454460	3455460	Nobody was surprised.
3455460	3456460	No one was surprised.
3456460	3457460	I asked around.
3457460	3460460	And you're not very well-liked amongst journals.
3460460	3461460	It's fine.
3461460	3463460	Oh, it's because you're so smart.
3463460	3464460	Sources.
3464460	3466460	It's because not only because of...
3466460	3469460	Well, the fellow journalist, what I heard recently,
3469460	3471460	he seemed to...
3471460	3474460	One said, you brag a lot about your stories.
3474460	3475460	Which I thought, okay, so what?
3475460	3477460	So I moved to David Bragg's big fucking deal.
3477460	3479460	And then he said something more like,
3479460	3482460	well, he would steal stories from other people.
3482460	3485460	I mean, he would get a lead that one guy would get.
3485460	3488460	And then he would come in and snag it.
3488460	3490460	And then sort of say, oh, but I'll give you the first byline.
3490460	3492460	I'll give you the first word.
3492460	3494460	And then he'll take it back.
3494460	3495460	And I'm like, okay, so fine.
3495460	3497460	So there's some under...
3497460	3498460	I'm sure...
3498460	3499460	I don't work in this business.
3499460	3500460	I don't know how it goes.
3500460	3501460	I'm sure there's sneaky stuff that happens.
3501460	3503460	Everyone's out for their own best interest.
3503460	3505460	And they want to get their stories out there.
3505460	3506460	I get it.
3506460	3507460	David's an ambitious guy.
3507460	3508460	And I respect that about you.
3508460	3509460	You're ambitious.
3509460	3516460	And then I hear a story about a woman who came to you.
3516460	3517460	And, oh, you found her.
3517460	3519460	I'm not sure which one it was,
3519460	3522460	but she was your source for sexual harassment suits
3522460	3525460	or sexual harassment things going on at some major bank.
3525460	3529460	And she came to you and she trusted you implicitly.
3529460	3534460	And the way you wrote the story was in favor of
3534460	3539460	the accuser, of the man who sexually harassed this woman.
3539460	3541460	And she was decimated.
3541460	3542460	She was decimated.
3542460	3546460	I've never written a story about sexual harassment, I think.
3546460	3547460	Are you sure?
3547460	3548460	What?
3548460	3549460	Not at the New York Times.
3549460	3550460	No, I've never.
3550460	3551460	Not once.
3551460	3552460	But before the New York Times.
3552460	3553460	Nope.
3553460	3554460	Never have done it.
3554460	3555460	Well, let's bring up the thing.
3555460	3556460	You want to do that now?
3556460	3557460	Yeah.
3557460	3558460	Let's bring it up.
3558460	3559460	Okay, look, Google...
3559460	3560460	Google...
3560460	3561460	I don't want...
3561460	3562460	She said not to say her name.
3562460	3563460	Is her name Lauren?
3563460	3566460	I told you, I'm not saying her name.
3566460	3567460	Is it for names Lauren?
3567460	3568460	I can tell you what your...
3568460	3569460	No, Lauren.
3569460	3570460	Tell me.
3570460	3571460	There it is.
3571460	3572460	Absolutely not.
3572460	3573460	You're saying...
3573460	3574460	I'm not saying...
3574460	3575460	Please can cut out this name.
3575460	3577460	I'm not going to play a guessing game with this.
3577460	3578460	If you guys want to...
3578460	3579460	I'm asking you.
3579460	3580460	If you will cut out the name.
3580460	3581460	Yeah, yeah.
3581460	3582460	So tell me the story.
3582460	3583460	No, I'm not...
3583460	3584460	What happened?
3584460	3585460	Absolutely not.
3585460	3586460	It's your chance to defend yourself.
3586460	3588460	I'll take my chances on that.
3588460	3589460	I'll take my chances on that.
3589460	3591460	If you guys want to make an accusation of...
3591460	3592460	I didn't make the accusation.
3592460	3594460	If someone were to make an accusation, they're welcome.
3594460	3596460	I am relaying information to you.
3596460	3597460	I have...
3597460	3598460	I have...
3599460	3600460	Relay away or don't?
3600460	3601460	I just did relay.
3601460	3602460	Okay, well that's not...
3602460	3604460	What you said is not true.
3604460	3606460	So what's your side?
3606460	3609460	I've never written a story about sexual harassment in a bank.
3609460	3613460	So your facts are obviously a fundamental problem.
3613460	3614460	No, well you seem...
3614460	3615460	They're facts.
3615460	3617460	You seem to know something about this.
3617460	3618460	And they know you very well.
3618460	3619460	If you...
3619460	3620460	You said the name and then...
3620460	3621460	Is that the right name?
3621460	3622460	Yes, that's the right name.
3622460	3623460	I'll tell you what happened.
3623460	3624460	And more than one source.
3624460	3625460	Is the right name?
3625460	3626460	Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened.
3626460	3628460	I was an editor on that story.
3628460	3631460	There's other people who wrote that story, not me.
3631460	3633460	And they didn't like the story.
3633460	3637460	They thought that she didn't get the...
3637460	3641460	They thought that Victor, the alleged perpetrator,
3641460	3642460	got more sympathy than she did.
3642460	3643460	Right.
3643460	3644460	That was very...
3644460	3645460	Was that?
3645460	3646460	Yeah, it certainly wasn't at me.
3646460	3648460	Because that's really interesting.
3648460	3650460	Because he said he didn't write the story, but he was the editor.
3650460	3653460	And being an editor is choosing what comes out.
3653460	3654460	Right.
3654460	3655460	If you say that...
3655460	3656460	Right?
3656460	3657460	Right?
3657460	3658460	Right?
3658460	3660460	Oh, you're looking at it again.
3660460	3661460	So, okay.
3661460	3663460	An editor from the story.
3663460	3665460	There are other people who write the story.
3665460	3667460	Again, that's his classic thing.
3667460	3669460	Blaming others.
3669460	3670460	One small.
3670460	3671460	This story.
3671460	3672460	No, I'm not...
3672460	3673460	What happened?
3673460	3674460	Absolutely...
3674460	3676460	There's your chance to defend yourself.
3676460	3678460	I'll take my chance on that.
3678460	3679460	I'll take my chance on that.
3679460	3681460	If you guys want to make an accusation...
3681460	3683460	I didn't make the accusation.
3683460	3685460	If someone wants to make an accusation, they're welcome.
3685460	3687460	I am relaying information to you.
3687460	3689460	I have...
3689460	3691460	Relay away or done?
3691460	3692460	I just did relay.
3692460	3693460	Okay, well, that's not...
3693460	3695460	What you said is not true.
3695460	3696460	That's interesting.
3696460	3698460	He thinks we're accusing them.
3698460	3699460	That's really weird.
3699460	3700460	Okay.
3700460	3701460	No, but he backed us on that.
3701460	3703460	This is one of the things I really need context on.
3703460	3704460	What do you mean?
3704460	3705460	So, I don't understand.
3705460	3708460	Because we have the footage of you calling the other reporters.
3708460	3709460	Right?
3709460	3710460	No.
3710460	3713460	I'm going to have to call him too at some point and see what, you know, to be ethical,
3713460	3714460	what we can use there.
3714460	3715460	Okay.
3715460	3716460	Yeah.
3716460	3717460	Even though we asked him.
3717460	3718460	We did not.
3718460	3719460	But it's different when...
3719460	3721460	He didn't know that it was me publicly disseminated, right?
3721460	3722460	Okay.
3722460	3723460	You did ask him.
3723460	3724460	Technically, you're correct.
3724460	3725460	Okay.
3725460	3726460	Have you not come again?
3726460	3728460	Yeah, I don't want to come again either.
3728460	3729460	Can you just...
3729460	3731460	I have to talk to a lawyer and see what the laws are on that.
3731460	3733460	Because if I put it out, it might be different.
3733460	3734460	That's all.
3734460	3736460	If we say you're being recorded...
3736460	3737460	Doesn't matter.
3737460	3738460	Okay.
3738460	3739460	I'm just going to check with the lawyer.
3739460	3740460	They will know the answer.
3740460	3741460	They will know the answer.
3741460	3742460	It doesn't matter.
3742460	3743460	If it's a yes, then I have things to consider.
3743460	3745460	If it's a no, there's not a discussion.
3745460	3746460	Are you okay?
3746460	3747460	Because it's the one way...
3747460	3748460	No, no.
3748460	3749460	We're careful.
3749460	3750460	It's okay.
3750460	3751460	Listen.
3751460	3752460	It doesn't matter.
3752460	3753460	It's not a law thing.
3753460	3754460	It doesn't matter.
3754460	3755460	Because often...
3755460	3756460	He's saying it's not a law thing.
3756460	3757460	It's about...
3757460	3758460	No, it is a law thing.
3758460	3759460	It's a camera thing.
3759460	3760460	I can check first if it's a law thing.
3760460	3761460	And if it's not, then yes.
3761460	3762460	There's like a...
3762460	3763460	Why are you saying it doesn't matter?
3763460	3764460	courtesy thing.
3765460	3767460	Why are you saying it doesn't matter?
3767460	3769460	It doesn't matter in the context of this conversation.
3769460	3770460	Because the conversation...
3770460	3771460	It matters in the context of the film.
3771460	3772460	I want to put that in there.
3772460	3773460	So, so you're clear.
3773460	3775460	She said it was us two in New York.
3775460	3776460	He said it doesn't matter.
3776460	3777460	We're asking for it.
3777460	3778460	This...
3778460	3780460	Whether or not I can include that in the film,
3780460	3782460	doesn't matter in the context of this conversation.
3782460	3783460	What he told you matters.
3783460	3785460	What he told you, I don't...
3785460	3786460	Not quite clear on.
3786460	3788460	What did that reporter tell you about this story
3788460	3790460	that you're referencing with David?
3790460	3791460	Okay.
3791460	3792460	You were there.
3792460	3793460	I know I was there.
3793460	3794460	I don't understand it.
3794460	3795460	How could I...
3795460	3796460	Why did I get the recording?
3796460	3797460	No, no.
3797460	3798460	I've listened to the recording too.
3798460	3799460	I'm asking you like what...
3799460	3802460	I still don't fully grasp.
3802460	3805460	First of all, I grasp what the reporter said.
3805460	3809460	What I'm not grasping is why you said he thinks you're accusing them.
3809460	3810460	Cusing him?
3810460	3811460	Because I see that.
3811460	3812460	We don't know either.
3812460	3813460	That's what's interesting.
3813460	3814460	Because he's so guilty.
3814460	3815460	Because he's so fucking guilty.
3815460	3816460	But he knows the story you're referencing.
3816460	3817460	He gets it in a second.
3817460	3818460	We blocked.
3818460	3820460	We did not know anything except what we just said.
3820460	3821460	We said, you were there.
3821460	3822460	You heard it with us from...
3822460	3823460	I know, I know.
3823460	3824460	I'm just...
3824460	3825460	That's what we know.
3825460	3826460	That's it.
3826460	3827460	There was something about a girl on a story.
3827460	3828460	Okay.
3828460	3830460	For a moment he was at the Wall Street Journal.
3830460	3834460	A girl, he would use as a source about a sexual harassment case.
3834460	3836460	That was at JP Morgan, right?
3836460	3837460	Morgan Stanley.
3837460	3839460	And Morgan Stanley, okay.
3839460	3843460	And he used her as a source and he told her that, you know, it's going to be about her
3843460	3844460	a terrible ordeal.
3844460	3845460	Defending her.
3845460	3846460	Defending her.
3846460	3848460	He writes a story.
3848460	3852460	The story takes sympathy for the accuser, the man.
3852460	3853460	The bank.
3853460	3854460	The Razor guy.
3854460	3855460	And the bank.
3855460	3856460	Which again...
3856460	3859460	She's upset about that because he totally flipped on her.
3859460	3860460	She's pissed off at him.
3860460	3861460	He flipped on her.
3861460	3862460	That's all we knew.
3862460	3863460	We didn't even know her name.
3863460	3864460	And he gave it...
3864460	3865460	He just fucking gave it away.
3865460	3866460	Made it.
3866460	3869460	And Matt refused to give us her name because they're friends.
3869460	3870460	Because they're friends.
3870460	3871460	And Matt...
3871460	3872460	Okay.
3872460	3873460	That makes sense, I understand.
3873460	3876460	Here is Matt, Matt's colleague.
3876460	3878460	And also Matt is now in New York.
3878460	3881460	But when this happened, he was living in London.
3881460	3882460	Right.
3882460	3883460	Okay.
3883460	3884460	All makes sense.
3884460	3885460	Thank you.
3885460	3886460	No, no.
3886460	3887460	What's the point?
3887460	3888460	There's a second possibility, actually.
3888460	3889460	Second possibility is this couldn't have been.
3889460	3890460	Another story.
3890460	3891460	Clearly fucking different.
3891460	3892460	Yeah.
3892460	3893460	I think it's the same story.
3893460	3894460	That's...
3894460	3895460	I'm think, but you're right.
3895460	3896460	It could be.
3896460	3897460	We should ask Matt if the name is...
3897460	3898460	He might not tell you.
3898460	3900460	Because he looks so angry.
3900460	3901460	You're right.
3901460	3904460	He's so angry that you're putting him on the spot.
3904460	3905460	Yeah.
3905460	3906460	He got red, too.
3906460	3907460	His face blushed.
3907460	3908460	David thought...
3908460	3909460	He doesn't know what to do.
3909460	3910460	He's stuck.
3910460	3911460	Yeah.
3911460	3912460	He's like on the trial.
3912460	3913460	But he went straight to accusations.
3913460	3914460	Yes, that's what I mean.
3914460	3915460	The other trial.
3915460	3916460	That's a show of guilt.
3916460	3917460	Yes.
3917460	3918460	That's interesting.
3918460	3921460	Because we were just asking a question.
3921460	3922460	So what happened?
3922460	3923460	Yeah.
3923460	3924460	We just...
3924460	3925460	No, we weren't just asking a question.
3925460	3926460	I mean...
3926460	3927460	We were showing that there's history.
3927460	3928460	Oh, pattern.
3928460	3930460	The pattern of inferring sources.
3930460	3931460	Yes.
3931460	3940460	But I think this and Eric looking at that must be fucking on his head.
3940460	3941460	Eric, the...
3941460	3945460	But what did you think we were accusing him of?
3945460	3946460	Of...
3946460	3947460	What did you say?
3947460	3948460	Of burning a source.
3948460	3949460	Sexual harassment?
3949460	3950460	No.
3950460	3951460	No.
3951460	3952460	Of not defending a victim.
3952460	3953460	No.
3953460	3955460	When you accuse somebody, you accuse them of something.
3955460	3956460	A crime.
3956460	3957460	Yes.
3957460	3959460	Accusing that he didn't help the source.
3959460	3960460	How is that a crime?
3960460	3961460	Accusation.
3961460	3962460	Accusation.
3962460	3963460	Something is severe.
3963460	3964460	No, that's not severe.
3964460	3965460	You're accusing me of, right?
3965460	3966460	You're accusing me of...
3966460	3967460	Robert, what could it be?
3967460	3968460	I don't know.
3968460	3969460	Let's go backwards.
3969460	3970460	I think I'm going to say it again.
3970460	3971460	I did, I did.
3971460	3972460	What?
3972460	3973460	None of the New York Times.
3973460	3974460	Okay.
3974460	3975460	I do have to...
3975460	3976460	I'm just kind.
3976460	3977460	You know, I respect that.
3977460	3978460	Hours.
3978460	3979460	Hours.
3979460	3980460	I'm just...
3980460	3982460	And then I hear a story about a woman...
3982460	3983460	And we have...
3983460	3984460	Look how much time there is, right?
3984460	3985460	One hour, right?
3985460	3986460	One hour.
3986460	3987460	Okay.
3987460	3988460	So I...
3988460	3989460	Over there.
3989460	3990460	Recording.
3990460	3991460	Who came to you...
3991460	3992460	Recording.
3992460	3993460	And...
3993460	3994460	Oh, you found her.
3994460	3995460	I'm not sure which one it was.
3995460	3999460	But she was your source for sexual harassment suits or sexual harassment thing that's going
3999460	4001860	on at some major bank.
4001860	4005940	And she came to you and she trusted you implicitly.
4005940	4014340	And the way you wrote the story was in favor of the accuser, of the man who sexually harassed
4014340	4015340	this woman.
4015340	4016340	What?
4016340	4017340	What?
4017340	4018340	What?
4018340	4022340	I've never written a story about sexual harassment right back.
4022340	4024340	Are you sure?
4024340	4025340	What?
4025340	4026340	Not at the New York Times.
4026340	4027340	No, I've never.
4027340	4028340	Not once.
4028340	4029340	But before the New York Times.
4029340	4030340	Nope.
4030340	4031340	Never have done it.
4031340	4032340	Well, let's bring up the thing.
4032340	4033340	You want to do that now?
4033340	4034340	Yeah.
4034340	4035340	Let's bring it up.
4035340	4036340	Okay.
4036340	4037340	Look.
4037340	4038340	Google...
4038340	4039340	Google...
4039340	4040340	I don't want...
4040340	4041340	She said not to say her name.
4041340	4042340	Is her name Lauren?
4042340	4043340	I told you that.
4043340	4044340	I'm not saying her name.
4044340	4045340	Yeah.
4045340	4046340	Yeah.
4046340	4047340	Because if her name is Lauren, I can tell you what you're referring to.
4047340	4048340	You're saying...
4048340	4049340	Please can cut out this name.
4049340	4052340	I'm not going to play a guessing game with this.
4052340	4053340	If you guys want to...
4053340	4054340	I'm asking...
4054340	4055340	We will cut out the name.
4055340	4056340	Yeah, yeah, I'm confused.
4056340	4057340	So tell me the story.
4057340	4058340	No, I'm not...
4058340	4059340	What happened?
4059340	4060340	Absolutely...
4060340	4061340	Defend yourself.
4061340	4062340	I'll take my chances on that.
4062340	4063340	I'll take my chances on that.
4063340	4064340	If you guys want to make an accusation...
4064340	4065340	I didn't make the accusation.
4065340	4067340	If some of them are making an accusation, they're welcome.
4067340	4068340	I am relaying information to you.
4068340	4069340	I have...
4069340	4070340	I don't think you think so.
4070340	4071340	Relay away or don't.
4071340	4072340	I just did.
4072340	4073340	I don't think you think so.
4073340	4074340	What you said is not true.
4074340	4075340	So what's your side?
4075340	4076340	I've never written a story about sexual harassment in the bank.
4076340	4077340	That's my side.
4077340	4078340	Okay.
4078340	4079340	So your facts are obviously fundamentally wrong.
4079340	4080340	No.
4080340	4081340	They're facts.
4081340	4082340	See, you seem to know something about this.
4082340	4083340	And they know you very well.
4083340	4084340	If you...
4084340	4085340	You said the name and then you said...
4085340	4086340	Is that the right name?
4086340	4087340	If that's the right name, I'll tell you what happened.
4087340	4088340	What happened?
4088340	4089340	It's the right name.
4089340	4090340	It's the right name?
4090340	4091340	Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened.
4091340	4092340	I was in a...
4092340	4093340	I was in a...
4093340	4094340	I was in a...
4094340	4095340	I was in a...
4095340	4096340	I was in a...
4096340	4097340	I was in a...
4097340	4098340	I was in a...
4098340	4099340	I was in a...
4099340	4100340	I was in a...
4100340	4101340	I was in a...
4101340	4102340	I was in...
4102340	4103340	I was in...
4103340	4104340	I was in a...
4104340	4105340	I was in...
4105340	4106340	I was in a...
4106340	4107340	I was in a...
4107340	4109340	I was in a...
4109340	4111340	ochita at the time.
4111340	4112340	Something like this.
4112340	4113340	But it's the right name.
4113340	4114340	Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened.
4114340	4115180	I was an editor on that story.
4115180	4116340	There's other people who wrote that story, not me.
4116340	4117340	Thank you.
4117340	4118340	And they didn't like the story.
4118340	4119340	They thought that she didn't get the...
4119340	4120340	They thought that this is the...
4120340	4121340	Or the alleged perpetrator...
4121340	4122340	Got more sympathy than she did.
4122340	4123340	Yes.
4123340	4124340	That was why I was pissed off.
4124340	4125340	Yeah.
4125340	4127340	And then certainly, it wasn't me.
4127340	4128340	Right, the story there was.
4128340	4129340	I had nothing to do with the reporting or writing of the story.
4129340	4135300	by the story by the way but there's but look this is journalism is hard Val and
4135300	4139660	we get things wrong we do I do personally journalists do all the time
4139660	4147260	and we it's an imperfect craft and you're gonna be able to find I'm telling
4147260	4153100	look for all the corrections I've had no you're gonna find some bad ones I'm
4153100	4156820	showing you a pattern okay I don't care about this corrections this is a
4156820	4159820	better because there's another person tell me my pattern to talk about her
4159820	4164980	lips what did you tell time you told her I'll just summarize because you don't
4164980	4169820	know what I'm getting at but do you tell Tammy that you know you will take care
4169820	4175020	of her that you will not you will keep her from the the wilds of other
4175020	4179900	journalists you will have this tension you will you will be more hands-on as
4179900	4183540	someone to protect her from what was the the repercussions of what was going to
4183540	4190660	happen right because only David could do this because David is the savior here
4190660	4196180	come and save the day and make your life let me tell you what I don't know
4196180	4201340	what you've heard or who you've heard it from but obviously I'm and I don't
4201340	4204140	even know why I'm responding to them where you just being big but I'll tell
4204140	4212380	you because I Tammy did something the Tammy did something that's very
4212380	4217420	crazy I tracked I've heard through the grapevine in Deutsche Bank's Jacksonville
4217420	4222820	Florida offices there was a woman who had voiced concerns about Trump loans or
4222820	4226460	Trump transactions and Kushner transactions and had then been fired
4226460	4232300	as a result of raising those concerns I tracked Tammy down down over a period of
4232300	4234300	weeks I convinced her to go on the record
4234300	4249180	because I have it you don't know but I have it on audited because at the same
4249180	4254660	day I was talking to the FBI they were here so and you called let me let me
4254660	4258620	just if you don't mind I don't actually I just don't know why you're telling me
4258620	4267340	it's something good and I know it happened the Tammy agreed after quite a while
4267340	4271820	spending time with me and talking to me to do something very courageous which was
4271820	4277500	to go on the record she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and
4277500	4280940	decided after talking with her husband after me talking with her husband this
4280940	4284580	is something she wanted to do it was extremely risky for her to do extremely
4284580	4293060	extremely courageous and that I mean that's the story that's like we spent
4293060	4297580	what must have been hours I think talking about the follow-up what the likely
4297580	4300900	follow-up would be from this what the implications would be how other media
4300900	4305020	would be pursuing her how Trump supporters would be so important because
4305020	4307780	this is also what I'm going to ask Scott about tomorrow and so my record
4307780	4315260	she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and decided to meet and
4315260	4321740	she's Jackson, Florida about to meet the source I'm very excited about it because I
4321740	4327380	haven't you don't know but I have it on audited because at the same day I was
4327380	4333060	talking to the FBI they were here so and you called let me let me just if you
4333060	4336420	don't mind I don't actually I just don't know why you're telling me something
4336420	4344580	didn't happen I said I know it happened the Tammy agreed after quite a while
4344580	4349060	spending time with me and talking to me to do something very courageous which was
4349060	4354740	to go on the record she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and
4354740	4358100	decided after talking with her husband after me talking with her husband but
4358100	4360820	this is something she wanted to do and it was extremely risky for her to do
4360860	4368380	extremely risky extremely courageous and it that I mean that's the story that's
4368380	4374300	like we spent what must have been hours I think talking about the follow-up what
4374300	4377580	the likely follow-up would be from this what the implications would be how other
4377580	4382540	media would be pursuing her how Trump supporters would be supporting her how
4382540	4395100	long and she's a very different version of the version says that she felt
4395100	4402020	unprotected she felt that you left her out I find that very hard to believe but
4402020	4405220	and she certainly has never communicated that to me she's communicated
4405220	4412180	something to you differently look Tammy is a courageous strong person and I feel
4412180	4416100	like she wants to speak for herself I totally respect that I'm not really
4416100	4422940	interested in communicating with my three I am the point is I'm bringing
4422940	4428420	showing you a pattern here okay tell me about Tom Hays no Tom Hays let's talk
4428420	4440700	about Tom Hays yes about you are the most intense about you are the most
4440740	4445820	intense longest lasting active source relations ever had Tom Hays is the
4445820	4453420	second longest and second most intense Tom and I talk regularly and he regularly
4453420	4459500	yes this is what I meant she said the most intense longest lasting active
4459500	4463380	source relations ever had Tom Hays is the second longest and second most intense
4463380	4472220	Tom and I talk regularly and he regularly yes when I met you said we
4472220	4476580	don't talk at all only to the lawyer I said why yeah that's a bit of a thing
4476580	4482840	well I don't know no I'm actually honestly what is that there is what does
4482840	4488020	that mean because yeah when you met yeah he said what I remember I was in the
4488020	4491820	apartment in Culver City I remember walking through the how long ago since
4491820	4500660	this is 2018 and I was walking through all the dirty clothes on the floor picking
4500660	4505740	them up David came in still we can help Tom because you give him some of the
4505740	4508260	Deutsche Bank files to show that he because I was still reading the book in
4508260	4512500	the middle of the audio book of this library book and I was like oh dude this
4512500	4516940	thing about Deutsche Bank we can give him a good lawyer or Tom all the files that
4516940	4521140	we have and they can help them reduce the sentence and he says well I don't
4521140	4525060	think that's gonna work I said why so well we don't really talk anymore so why
4525060	4528900	what happened instead of that of falling out he said the wife doesn't like me at
4528900	4533300	all Sarah yeah yeah that's what the text referred to that's what the text
4533300	4537380	referred to yeah okay okay that's what I need clarity up yeah and I said well
4537380	4540660	what I said when I get into impossible to talk to my I can only send an email I
4540660	4545580	can't actually comment so I'm gonna I probably will call I can't guarantee it
4546300	4551580	he said David said to me that I cannot call Tom like because it's only through
4551580	4555900	a lawyer because as he's in he's in jail so through a lawyer I get an email the
4555900	4559660	email it goes to the lawyer the lawyer then communicates Tom somehow you still
4559660	4563220	in jail I don't know if you're sure to look it up but I think you got it
4563220	4568420	since reduced by from 14 years to seven years so yes that's still me in jail but
4568420	4572820	I can call and I remember yeah I know David told me he would give him his
4573540	4577740	contact he's probably giving the lawyers contact we'll see lawyer yeah call
4577740	4581860	it's texting Tom I'm gonna say I want Tom's contact you want to hear oh yeah
4581860	4586180	yeah you said you're giving Tom's contact yeah I'm just telling you I get
4586180	4593900	them from what I'm gonna do and this is dog twice there's a the proof twice
4593900	4599220	because I also asked Val how can I contact Tom and he said we come because
4599220	4602640	David had it falling out okay they're not talking but why did you want to
4602640	4606620	contact and here you look at the files because yeah I had a Deutsche Bank shit
4606620	4609220	and I thought I could get a sentence reduced we can show that he how we help
4609220	4612380	here though because the Deutsche Bank hold on Deutsche Bank trader was doing
4612380	4616300	more illegal shit than Tom so Tom wasn't he was taken to fall for all these
4616300	4619940	other guys doing shit and Tom just didn't care David told me like Tom didn't
4619940	4623540	carry like Tom's out to destroy the world like he's a really care like he's in
4623620	4629500	jail so how can I care he's in fucking jail I know he's telling me like Tom
4629500	4633820	is an autistic like savant sort of thing and that he's out there and he wants
4633820	4637780	the whole world to burn down not just the banks it's like what it didn't make
4637780	4641060	any sense so he just shot down the idea of helping me helping this guy I could
4641060	4643940	have that was when they were in the falling out yeah since game regain
4643940	4647100	contact no but doesn't we don't know the truth it's a falling out either way
4647100	4654060	David said that no I said here's a bunch of shit let's assume let's go by as
4654060	4657420	well don't know the point is what it's more important now I realized that
4657420	4661580	because imagine if you're in jail and some writer decides your life for you
4661580	4666740	he's like fucking Davis decide no this don't give it to him it's not even give
4666740	4669860	a trot well there's a lot of steps that would have to be proven but it's
4669860	4677340	hypothetically could happen but also the point is how David interacts with
4677340	4682760	his life yes how hard is it for me to give him a bunch of files and David
4682760	4686340	hand those files to the lawyer it's not difficult especially when you want to
4686340	4691380	supposedly help your soul right so it's like what the fuck he refuses he didn't
4691380	4694820	well there's a fine line I'm not saying that you got it wrong or right I'm saying
4695140	4701060	that the only way to really know is talk to Tom and say you know you're talking
4701060	4704600	about different things on what we're talking about is this did David have a
4704600	4708140	falling out with Tom and did he then regain access that's the question that's
4708140	4711700	for you that's your question my question I don't have a question I'm just I'm
4711700	4715980	pointing out I'm a member of realization that this happened okay that prompt
4715980	4722420	can I interject because I am now imagining how many people I've reached out
4722420	4727220	to David to talk to Val and how many times has he blocked that communication
4727220	4735900	the way he did for Tom Tom and I are in regular touch he Tom is a
4735900	4744980	complicated person and it look Tom was another courageous person who is I feel
4744980	4748020	like I've done right by if he wants to say something different or if his wife
4748020	4752380	Sarah wants to say something different I respect for both of them but I
4753060	4758220	stand by my handling of Tom Hayes I certainly stand by my handling of Tammy
4758220	4763420	McFadden the situation you're referring to on this story I edited with Lauren is
4763420	4768220	I also stand by my handling of that although I recognize that that writing
4768220	4773620	with sexual harassment is very hard and it's very hard and you know what and I'm
4773620	4777020	not saying that's what happened with Lauren but we make mistakes the New
4777020	4782740	York Times does the journalist do I do there's and I honestly like part of the
4782740	4787740	that of this it feels a little ridiculous to me is that I can own my
4787740	4794980	mistakes you know I make mistakes in my professional life my personal life we
4794980	4800340	all do yes and yeah well and I'm owning that so I don't feel like that's
4801060	4804700	other than mine and say anything you've made a mistake with you said you stand by
4804700	4808380	the story with Lauren you said you stand by the story with Tammy and fucking Tom
4808380	4818060	too and Tom's 14 years in jail now does your help look I think you're presenting
4818060	4821220	you a pattern that what you're talking about is great but it's irrelevant my
4821220	4824420	point is that there's a pattern of people there was your sources that said
4824420	4829460	that you they've been left out high and dry to hang because of you and they do
4829460	4833780	not have kind of things to say about okay and you have co-workers that say not
4833780	4840220	that specifically they just more address the ambition and you're sort of wanting
4840220	4843980	to put yourself in the story this is this is my favorite response when I said
4843980	4847940	talking about David said well and this is most politically correct response I
4847940	4853460	get well David has his own style which I respect greatly but you know I just I'm
4853460	4860180	not I'm not it's not my style to put myself in this time it's not my style
4860180	4865420	to put myself in this time thank you that's all I have to say I can't tell
4865420	4870300	you anymore let's talk again that's what I got and I have almost respect for my
4870300	4874060	colleagues if some of them have issues with how I've done stuff they have not
4874060	4878140	expressed but they're definitely in terms of dependence and you were in the story
4878140	4882180	more do I mean isn't this story you wish you were the store now I think it's
4882220	4885140	exceptionally awkward for the general but you make yourself the story they're
4885140	4891060	changing well in this one me and my whistleblower and this one I definitely
4891060	4897860	did it's in the town you're in my whistleblower like you own me yeah
4897860	4903220	yeah sorry I've been trying to say something about Tommy also I think it's
4903220	4909260	interesting that I think you've got a question
4909260	4919980	you think of the golden yeah and oh God yes somebody you've been working with
4919980	4925740	if I'm correct me for long for as long as you work as well and it seems like you
4925740	4934580	vote a piece about Tommy based I don't know whether proof of what you were
4934620	4943940	recording but what to me was striking is that you have worked with Val for so
4943940	4950860	many years it was basically second wife and it's provided with all the
4950860	4955940	document all the receipt all the proof that you needed and that was not enough
4955940	4960860	but Tommy told you something and that was enough in her word that's exactly
4960860	4970220	brilliant thank you yes yes oh but tell me it's great and I'm no reason genius
4970220	4974420	you know why because that is exactly right you go down the floor you talk to
4974420	4980340	Tammy you come back with no documentary evidence nothing at all but her work and
4980340	4985180	you publish that and the world listens to it's like oh well it's a New York times
4985180	4990300	it must be true I come to you with hundreds of thousands of fucking
4990820	4997980	documents and futile documents you're fucking futile all right and then you do
4997980	5002300	this to me and you discredit me but let my documents and speak to themselves
5002300	5006020	well that was a fucking asshole but the documents are speaking to themselves
5006020	5009660	sometimes and then you have absolutely nothing with Tammy you come back with
5009660	5012860	these stars reports alleged stars reports you don't even think about
5012860	5016860	Susan Scarrett you probably didn't think about it right now
5016860	5021860	Susan Scarrett is the one that fucking has me fucking David think about you
5021860	5025380	could have gotten them from there but no it was enough for you to get a word from
5025380	5029980	Tammy and then spin it as he did into this big huge story which Tammy ended up
5029980	5033860	suffering from and still does today she didn't want all this publicity she's
5033860	5037900	one people howling here she's a lot like anyone into this with her eyes wide open
5037900	5044020	that's what she there perhaps she did but the way I mean again she's not here
5044020	5049180	Tammy did something really courageous and took a lot of personal risks and I I
5049180	5056440	can't tell you the admiration I have and you know what Tammy was here saying
5056440	5060940	something to me saying to me what you were saying she said to you I guess like
5060940	5066940	I would have a very different reaction I these I have I just have the utmost
5066980	5072460	respect respect thank you we all respect me yes thank you where's my
5072460	5076100	respect and my courageous I have a lot of respect for you are you are where is
5076100	5081300	that in this story show me waiters it don't tell me fucking show me where is
5081300	5085580	it in your profile my I don't know where it is if it's not in their values should
5085580	5089980	be I have respect for you I have a lot of respect well it doesn't feel like me
5089980	5099220	please please please he does he gets it he gets it it's David do you understand
5099220	5102940	what's going on here do you understand what we're trying to tell you yes it
5102940	5108300	seems in a way I'm being targeted by you and you target me now I could there's
5108300	5113260	millions of little we've been armchair psychology just for a long time and I
5113260	5118180	took it back to the beginning when I first met you when you're stalking me
5118220	5122820	for about a month and a half and I kept saying no no no back the fuck off until
5122820	5127380	I until I was at David Grant David Grant I said I mean you don't you don't know
5127380	5131580	this about Florida to you but I said David Grant I said David I don't know
5131580	5134700	anything about journalists you're the only journalist you're not even David
5134700	5138500	Grant at the time was no longer a journalist he was the he wrote lots of
5138500	5144660	easy now he's a superstar writer but at the time he was willing to help me
5144660	5147780	because he knew journalists you know deal with them I said there's this one guy
5147860	5151540	that's fucking driving me nuts and David Enrich or Enrich they called you
5151540	5154500	Enrich still at the time because they pronounce it the proper German German
5154500	5159780	but sorry that's just an old joke you're supposed to laugh I'm not finding
5159780	5165140	this amusing I know it's great for me though but anyway please so I said David
5165140	5168620	can you get this fucking guy off my back he's driving me crazy he's sending
5168620	5173020	letters to my mother my little sisters I mean that everybody is he's bothering
5173020	5176700	us can you help me with it and David says yes of course let me let me do my
5176740	5182820	best but David Grant is a timid kind guy he does not like to confrontation and
5182820	5186660	he didn't and he feels pretty bad about it but he didn't come he didn't get you
5186660	5190940	off my back and you kept pushing and he kept pushing and he kept pushing and
5190940	5195260	then you called one day and he said Val I'm gonna write the story whether you
5195260	5200540	like it or not you can say something you can give me some documents you can tell
5200540	5204140	me some more about your father's relationship to Anshun or all that shit
5204540	5209740	okay or I'm just gonna publish one of the fuck I want and I was like you know fuck you remember this
5209740	5217740	conversation and then I hung up and then you published Bill Brooksman kills
5217740	5225380	himself amid anxiety and fear into library bro library bro right at the
5225380	5229500	time I'm like what the fuck's a library right I don't know shit about finance I
5229500	5233300	taught myself finance probably last five years okay at that time I didn't know
5233300	5238060	what the fuck I was talking about it took me a few years and I really should
5238060	5241300	have thought through a little bit better but I didn't but I was such a fool at
5241300	5246580	that time but that was exactly the time you were writing your book on live or
5246580	5252740	exactly at that time yes it was because you at well you want proof of three
5252740	5255820	months later you're asking me I'm writing a book on a library Val do you can
5255820	5258980	you search these documents to your father's father's right you wrote me a
5258980	5263940	list to search for specifically a book no I'm thinking Jesus did David just use
5263940	5269740	my father's name to promote his book on live or that's what I'm thinking and I
5269740	5273820	couldn't believe it I started writing a book in the summer no one knows why
5273820	5277740	anyone kills themselves what gives you the right to say this is why Bill Brooksman
5277740	5281060	kills himself what gives you the right to say that's not what that article said
5281060	5284900	that's what the title says literally that's what the heading said
5284900	5286900	read it who's got it
5286900	5288900	we're looking at the internet
5288900	5290900	it's not everyone's fun
5290900	5292900	okay tell me what's
5292900	5294900	I would like you to know who the
5294900	5296900	by-lines are on this article
5296900	5298900	take a look
5298900	5300900	well tell you
5300900	5302900	my name is on there and I'm not sure it is
5302900	5304900	it's the 4th of 4 by-lines
5304900	5306900	okay library Brooksman
5306900	5308900	I'll show you
5308900	5310900	and my dad has nothing to do with library
5310900	5312900	and you know that
5312900	5314900	so this is important to you because you don't know
5314900	5316900	yeah I need context
5316900	5318900	so he when he wrote this story
5318900	5320900	I was a Sausalito I remember
5320900	5322900	and David
5322900	5324900	he was the one calling me
5324900	5326900	no one else did no one else called me
5326900	5328900	he was constantly calling me asking me to comment
5328900	5330900	asking me to comment I said no no no
5330900	5332900	and he says well I'm gonna publish it tomorrow then it's your last chance after a week of this
5332900	5334900	said no it's nothing I can't
5334900	5336900	no comment the story comes out
5336900	5338900	and it says written by David Enbridge
5338900	5340900	and Jenny Strasberg
5340900	5342900	had a third thing
5342900	5344900	let's look it up right now
5344900	5346900	and now he's saying oh I'm not the only one
5346900	5348900	yeah so he's trying to blame someone else on it
5348900	5350900	and it's clearly him
5350900	5352900	and also his book was on library
5352900	5354900	weeks later
5354900	5356900	he would say hey look up these things for me
5356900	5358900	I'm writing a book on library
5358900	5360900	look up these keywords in your dad's
5360900	5362900	files
5362900	5364900	see Brooksman
5364900	5366900	suicide
5366900	5368900	um
5368900	5370900	this is the library
5370900	5372900	this is the keywords
5372900	5374900	it's not Deutsche Bank
5374900	5376900	executive dismissal
5376900	5378900	library fixing is conspiracy
5378900	5380900	no no
5380900	5382900	it's uh
5382900	5384900	here executive who committed suicide anxious
5384900	5386900	admits Deutsche Bank probes
5386900	5388900	that's what's in the title
5388900	5390900	executive who committed suicide anxious
5390900	5392900	he said it's not in the title
5392900	5394900	Deutsche Bank probes
5394900	5396900	former top banker was involved in investigations
5396900	5398900	he felt abandoned by his colleagues
5398900	5400900	by dogs
5400900	5402900	that's what he said in the book
5402900	5404900	he keeps up that same thing
5404900	5406900	Jenny Strasberg
5406900	5408900	what does that mean?
5408900	5410900	nothing
5410900	5412900	I'm just wondering if that was his excuse
5412900	5414900	my name is last on the byline
5414900	5416900	so it's um
5416900	5418900	it's not really me
5418900	5420900	like the sexual harassment
5420900	5422900	I was the editor
5422900	5424900	not really me
5424900	5426900	like Kenny
5426900	5428900	so Aika's on it and David Enrich
5428900	5430900	and um the first book is about library
5430900	5432900	and that's what he's tried to do
5432900	5434900	promote
5434900	5436900	use his source to promote the book
5436900	5438900	like Schrocker just said he subconsciously said
5438900	5440900	it was me
5440900	5442900	what?
5442900	5444900	that he subconsciously said yes I did
5444900	5446900	he did he said yes I did
5446900	5448900	it sounds like he said no I didn't
5448900	5450900	but we'll review that close to this
5450900	5452900	and by the way just so you guys know why
5452900	5454900	I thought about this comfortable
5454900	5456900	reviewing this with you
5456900	5458900	one because of David leaking the text to me
5458900	5460900	and I feel
5460900	5462900	I'm not a print journalist
5462900	5464900	and I'm not a um
5464900	5466900	of writing a book
5466900	5468900	and I understand how both of those things work
5468900	5470900	I'm shooting a documentary in this case
5470900	5472900	you're writing a book?
5472900	5474900	no I'm saying I'm not writing a book for this
5474900	5476900	and I'm not a print journalist
5476900	5478900	I'm shooting a documentary
5478900	5480900	and a documentary the great thing about it
5480900	5482900	that's as close as you get to real life
5482900	5484900	a representation
5484900	5486900	so the fact that he leaked me the text
5486900	5488900	and the fact that this is the daily's content
5488900	5490900	I'm not reviewing any other footage with you
5490900	5492900	I'm only reviewing this because I need context
5492900	5494900	and to do it like where I question you
5494900	5496900	like he would
5496900	5498900	that's a print journalist
5498900	5500900	that's not what I'm doing here
5500900	5502900	and um
5502900	5504900	yeah I don't like I'm gonna do a split screen
5504900	5506900	in some instances so
5506900	5508900	you know like old 70's movies
5508900	5510900	I'm gonna say I'm stylizing that
5510900	5512900	like that is what I'm thinking in my head
5512900	5514900	so like you dress like this actually makes
5514900	5516900	a big sense in that case
5516900	5518900	and not in a funny way but like you know what I mean
5518900	5520900	it's almost like you're taking the piss
5520900	5522900	it's like having without knowing
5522900	5524900	it's like you saying something
5524900	5526900	him saying something and then like boof
5526900	5528900	you know what I mean and it will pause one
5528900	5530900	I like that idea
5530900	5532900	that's actually an idea
5532900	5534900	that people cannot refute
5534900	5536900	I think it's like the one way
5536900	5538900	facts don't matter in a lot of cases
5538900	5540900	to at least convince someone these days
5540900	5542900	which is terrible but so it is
5542900	5544900	that sort of stuff well I mean if you put
5544900	5546900	even Trump saying you know
5546900	5548900	I didn't rape that baby
5548900	5550900	and then you have him raping a baby
5550900	5552900	people are gonna see him raping a baby
5552900	5554900	even his supporters are gonna say okay yeah
5554900	5556900	you probably rape that baby
5556900	5558900	sorry he's the worst example possible
5558900	5560900	terrible image man
5560900	5562900	Trump just raping babies
5562900	5564900	thank you for that image
5564900	5566900	I want to point out something else
5566900	5568900	oh really?
5568900	5570900	that after this first day
5570900	5572900	David is
5572900	5574900	sending you an email
5574900	5576900	to influence your documentary
5576900	5578900	well he did influence everybody
5578900	5580900	influences my documentary but maybe not the way
5580900	5582900	he wanted right?
5582900	5584900	yeah yeah
5584900	5586900	I'm not gonna do that
5586900	5588900	my job is
5588900	5590900	hang on when you are not being
5590900	5592900	commissioned by Val
5592900	5594900	right no I mean
5594900	5596900	Val's gonna kiss me already a couple of times
5596900	5598900	you know but he's pretending
5598900	5600900	that you are well of course
5600900	5602900	cause it helps him but I saved the daily microphone
5602900	5604900	the first thing I said is I'm not
5604900	5606900	you know I'm not Val's crew
5606900	5608900	I am my crew I asked you know
5608900	5610900	I reached out to Val and he said yes
5610900	5612900	go go go eat

5700900	5702900	and the more she ignores him
5702900	5704900	the more
5704900	5706900	the more you ignore me

5730900	5732900	wait Val hang on
5732900	5734900	there's you've seen
5734900	5736900	showed it to me
5736900	5738900	you have the documents
5738900	5740900	that his psychologist and his doctor
5740900	5742900	wrote to the coroner
5742900	5744900	that very clearly says that he expressed anxiety
5744900	5746900	about the library investigation
5746900	5748900	he expressed anxiety about a lot of things
5748900	5750900	but you chose library
5750900	5752900	because you were writing about library
5752900	5754900	right?
5754900	5756900	maybe subconsciously
5756900	5758900	maybe didn't consciously
5758900	5760900	explicitly this psychologist
5760900	5762900	in the doctor's report cite
5762900	5764900	the government investigations into library
5764900	5766900	is what Bill, your father told them
5766900	5768900	they cite a lot more than just that
5768900	5770900	but you picked and she is the one that worked for you
5770900	5772900	there you go
5772900	5774900	there's the title
5774900	5776900	executive is committed suicide
5776900	5778900	anxious amid Deutsche Bank pros
5778900	5780900	okay
5780900	5782900	former top banker is involved in investigations
5782900	5784900	investigations felt abandoned by colleagues
5784900	5786900	he's a share
5786900	5788900	Janice Strasberg, Dallas Turner
5788900	5790900	Ikenning
5790900	5792900	Ikenning
5792900	5794900	what does that mean?
5794900	5796900	well that means
5796900	5798900	the by lines in general
5798900	5800900	so the first by lines
5800900	5802900	the person who did most of the work second
5802900	5804900	so fourth is the most important
5804900	5806900	I have to give them appropriate time
5806900	5808900	because if I say to them
5808900	5810900	when is the daily airing
5810900	5812900	if you think it's mid-march
5812900	5814900	I'll try to figure out but I can't bug them till mid-march
5814900	5816900	I'll find out
5816900	5818900	I told you guys I wouldn't
5818900	5820900	proceed your airing
5820900	5822900	but I also said that if you didn't air it
5822900	5824900	all bets are off
5824900	5826900	so give me an air date and give me a final air date
5826900	5828900	and like I'm editing my film
5828900	5830900	I'm giving you a courtesy because really
5830900	5832900	I told you these were the stakes
5832900	5834900	what did you tell me you were from
5834900	5836900	where I was from?
5836900	5838900	do they ask you like what were you doing?
5838900	5840900	I'm starting a new company
5840900	5842900	I told them very clearly
5842900	5844900	I have my logos and stuff I'm ready to launch
5844900	5846900	we're going to call it scanner
5846900	5848900	that's good
5848900	5850900	it's true too
5850900	5852900	I have a contract in my clause
5852900	5854900	that says if any of this shit gets messed up
5854900	5856900	with the business until the new operating room is formed
5856900	5858900	that I control the footage
5858900	5860900	and I own it
5860900	5862900	it's an independent film right now
5862900	5864900	I know where I want to air it
5864900	5866900	and on my new platform
5866900	5868900	but I'm saying
5868900	5870900	I still have a few things to get sorted out
5870900	5872900	I missed what you said
5872900	5874900	right after that
5874900	5876900	15-20 seconds
5876900	5878900	he's saying something
5878900	5880900	maybe
5880900	5882900	subconsciously
5882900	5884900	I don't know
5884900	5886900	the psychologist in the doctor's report
5886900	5888900	cite the government investigations
5888900	5890900	into the library as what Bill your father told them
5890900	5892900	they cite a lot more than just that
5892900	5894900	but you picked and she is the one that worked for you guys
5894900	5896900	there you go
5896900	5898900	there you go
5898900	5900900	there's the title

5902900	5904900	for top bankers involved
5904900	5906900	investigation
5906900	5908900	investigation is felt abandoned by colleagues
5908900	5910900	this is Sherry
5910900	5912900	Jenny Strasberg
5912900	5914900	Giles Turner
5914900	5916900	Ikenning
5916900	5918900	and David Ennerich
5918900	5920900	what does that mean
5920900	5922900	well that means
5922900	5924900	byline is in general
5924900	5926900	so the first byline
5926900	5928900	is the person who did most of the work
5928900	5930900	so fourth is the least important
5930900	5932900	so you were the least important
5932900	5934900	so why did you call me
5934900	5936900	and tell me you're going to write whatever you want
5936900	5938900	I mean I obviously never said that
5938900	5940900	but you're the editor right
5940900	5942900	at the time I was a reporter
5942900	5944900	you were not an editor at the Wall Street Journal this time
5944900	5946900	I think my title was European
5946900	5948900	banking editor but that was kind of like a reporting editor
5948900	5950900	so these were not your subordinates
5950900	5952900	you did not work for you
5952900	5954900	I think maybe Jenny
5954900	5956900	who's the first one named
5956900	5958900	Jenny is the first one
5958900	5960900	I stand by the story
5960900	5962900	we can just skip
5962900	5964900	you stand by the story
5964900	5966900	what do you think someone would read this
5966900	5968900	if they don't know anything about
5968900	5970900	you know how newspapers are
5970900	5972900	I don't remember
5972900	5974900	here's the question
5974900	5976900	he says
5976900	5978900	that he was a reporter editor
5978900	5980900	but his title was European banking editor
5980900	5982900	an editor writes the headlines
5982900	5984900	a reporter does not write the headlines
5984900	5986900	so if you're a reporter
5986900	5988900	a lot of times the reporter will get pissed
5988900	5990900	because the headline
5990900	5992900	is not indicative of the story
5992900	5994900	or they feel so
5994900	5996900	yes an editor writes the headlines
5996900	5998900	now there's some blurry lines there
5998900	6000900	but what I'm saying is if he was both the editor
6000900	6002900	and the reporter
6002900	6004900	there's no way around him knowing what the headline would have been
6004900	6006900	and that's something that
6006900	6008900	you know that's better for me
6008900	6010900	to talk to him about because I am an editor
6010900	6012900	and was an editor and I can say to him
6012900	6014900	how do you explain that because I know for a fact
6014900	6016900	in the New York Times
6016900	6018900	I'm sure reporters have influence
6018900	6020900	and perhaps your standards
6020900	6022900	well first of all what's your standard now
6022900	6024900	what's your public editor say about how you present
6024900	6026900	what the headline might be to the reporters
6026900	6028900	and sometimes there's so little time
6028900	6030900	between finishing the story and writing the headline
6030900	6032900	they don't get to see it
6032900	6034900	I don't know what your policy is
6034900	6036900	what's your policy
6036900	6038900	it's probably different with every case
6038900	6040900	but a lot of times
6040900	6042900	maybe they don't see it
6042900	6044900	they're just so antiquated
6044900	6046900	that the headline may be laid out
6046900	6048900	and the story is still there
6048900	6050900	and so they don't see it until it goes to print
6050900	6052900	at the same time I'm pretty sure they have a big screen
6052900	6054900	in the New York Times, I know they do
6054900	6056900	that every day the entire day
6056900	6058900	as the layout person makes the paper
6058900	6060900	you see it in real time
6060900	6062900	I believe that's the case
6062900	6064900	I know the screen is there and I believe it's in real time
6064900	6066900	Is that the Wall Street Journal though at the time
6066900	6068900	they would have a similar system
6068900	6070900	just probably not projected against the wall
6070900	6072900	the Wall Street is
6072900	6074900	what's that?
6074900	6076900	I was looking for this ashram
6076900	6078900	I know it's in my left the whole time
6078900	6080900	but you're saying
6080900	6082900	there's no way around it
6082900	6084900	he might have an explanation
6084900	6086900	but even so he says I stand by my story
6086900	6088900	so let's say you go to New York
6088900	6090900	and he says I stand by my story
6090900	6092900	that's what he said
6092900	6094900	the headline is important
6094900	6096900	and you know this as an editor
6096900	6098900	but the headline is usually that anyone
6098900	6100900	72% there's I'll find the number
6100900	6102900	72% is what they read
6102900	6104900	so it's very important
6104900	6106900	and as the editor and reporter
6106900	6108900	I need to know who wrote the headline
6108900	6110900	if it wasn't you who wrote the headline
6110900	6112900	did you see it?
6112900	6114900	and I have several points that I'm going to address with you
6114900	6116900	that I think
6116900	6118900	that will make this very fair
6118900	6120900	but the power and balance here
6120900	6122900	in terms of who's writing about whom
6122900	6124900	we know what that is
6124900	6126900	and I'll take that into account
6126900	6128900	I don't need to show you
6128900	6130900	this is it
6130900	6132900	they know this there's an empowering balance
6132900	6134900	you say it to them
6134900	6136900	there's an empowering balance in that relationship
6136900	6138900	for everyone that's a source
6138900	6140900	and a journalist
6140900	6142900	there is indicative
6142900	6144900	and that's what this show is about
6144900	6146900	it's about how are you portrayed
6146900	6148900	versus who you are and the truth is somewhere in between
6148900	6150900	and no one gets 100% right
6150900	6152900	all the time
6152900	6154900	99%
6154900	6156900	it's hard to get 100% right
6156900	6158900	he's right about that
6158900	6160900	but that's not an excuse
6160900	6162900	he's using it as an excuse
6162900	6164900	that's what I'm saying
6164900	6166900	I'm not
6166900	6168900	I'm not a place to blame
6168900	6170900	and blame is not a thing here
6170900	6172900	I'm not here to
6172900	6174900	blame anyone's feet
6174900	6176900	I know you are
6176900	6178900	that's why I'm filming you
6178900	6180900	the bankers died
6180900	6182900	and they read this and said
6182900	6184900	Deutsche Bank pros
6184900	6186900	what is the subtext
6186900	6188900	is your point that he was
6188900	6190900	a target of investigation to them
6190900	6192900	what is the subtext
6192900	6194900	target of investigations
6194900	6196900	and he kills himself because
6196900	6198900	of the library
6198900	6200900	that's what you're saying
6200900	6202900	that's what this title says about my father
6202900	6204900	it's fair
6204900	6206900	it doesn't say he killed himself
6206900	6208900	because of the library
6208900	6210900	but yes the most people
6210900	6212900	50% of people at the very least
6212900	6214900	are going to assume
6214900	6216900	exactly
6216900	6218900	that's the nature of it
6218900	6220900	and David just said he just gave it away
6220900	6222900	he doesn't know why I'm pissed off
6222900	6224900	so he interrupted me to say
6224900	6226900	do you mean because I wrote
6226900	6228900	he was the target of the investigation
6228900	6230900	I don't even know that
6230900	6232900	but yes that's part of it
6232900	6234900	he's guilt is saying
6234900	6236900	Valis thinks I'm
6236900	6238900	because I wrote him the target of the investigation
6238900	6240900	I'm going to talk about this stuff tomorrow
6240900	6242900	tomorrow is going to be a long day dude
6242900	6244900	is that okay with you
6244900	6246900	if Scott doesn't make it
6246900	6248900	look honestly it's not the end of the world
6248900	6250900	because there's so much to talk about
6250900	6252900	because that right there
6252900	6254900	the context of that
6254900	6256900	people aren't going to understand from the book
6256900	6258900	nor well I guess he gets into it a little bit in the book
6258900	6260900	but they're not going to understand the history
6260900	6262900	that you guys have had
6262900	6264900	and the first article
6264900	6266900	I'm not going to say it glosses over that history
6266900	6268900	he admits that I think he admits
6268900	6270900	I think it's fair to say
6270900	6272900	and I'm not saying this the footage will say this
6272900	6274900	and people have their own thing
6274900	6276900	Frost Nixon then just got Nixon to admit
6276900	6278900	he apologizes
6278900	6280900	why is he apologizing
6280900	6282900	well I'm not saying that
6282900	6284900	I have to get more clarification on why he apologizes
6284900	6286900	because him saying this to you
6286900	6288900	of course he's nervous man
6288900	6290900	and I do give him credit for apologizing
6290900	6292900	but as you said and we have you on camera
6292900	6294900	and so I'm okay saying this
6294900	6296900	but he'll apologize
6296900	6298900	so were you surprised by his apology
6298900	6300900	you at least expected it as a possibility
6300900	6302900	you said that
6302900	6304900	it's really interesting
6304900	6306900	it's really interesting
6306900	6308900	this is the
6308900	6310900	anybody else in the room
6310900	6312900	reads this line going in naked
6312900	6314900	you've made your point pal
6314900	6316900	I disagree
6316900	6318900	but I respect where you're coming from
6318900	6320900	and I hear you and also I have never thankfully
6320900	6322900	been in a situation
6322900	6324900	as terrible as what you've been through
6324900	6326900	I cannot begin
6326900	6328900	to imagine the hurt
6328900	6330900	and the trauma
6330900	6332900	that you have experienced
6332900	6334900	I can't
6334900	6336900	please
6336900	6338900	why did you exploit it then
6338900	6340900	I certainly did not try to exploit it
6340900	6342900	how much money have you made off of me
6342900	6344900	and my father
6344900	6346900	how much money have you made off of myself
6346900	6348900	I don't think I've made
6348900	6350900	I've received what I would consider in the publishing industry
6350900	6352900	a relatively meager advance
6352900	6354900	and it's
6354900	6356900	there's healthcare
6356900	6358900	you have
6358900	6360900	$1.5 million house
6360900	6362900	we have
6362900	6364900	cars
6364900	6366900	that's what this is
6366900	6368900	you have cars
6368900	6370900	I have a toyota
6370900	6372900	2017 toyota scene at minivan
6372900	6374900	a proper job
6374900	6376900	so that's the thing about the minivan
6376900	6378900	it's important
6378900	6380900	I'm very proud to say that why
6380900	6382900	because at New York Times
6382900	6384900	there's a whole thing on him
6384900	6386900	having a minivan
6386900	6388900	there's a story about David Enrich
6388900	6390900	New York Times reporter owns a minivan
6390900	6392900	I shoot minivans all the time
6392900	6394900	I know
6394900	6396900	but remember the whole course
6396900	6398900	David wants to be the story
6398900	6400900	he knows how to do good
6400900	6402900	he knows PR a little bit
6402900	6404900	that's for sure
6404900	6406900	but remember what he was saying
6406900	6408900	he was a part of the story
6408900	6410900	he wishes he was being reported on
6410900	6412900	and here he is in the New York Times
6412900	6414900	and Maria and I saw that
6414900	6416900	he was like oh my god
6416900	6418900	he is the Hunter S. Thompson of Banking Reporting
6418900	6420900	yes
6420900	6422900	look
6422900	6424900	the point is that
6424900	6426900	he pushed someone at the New York Times
6426900	6428900	to say do a story about me
6428900	6430900	and here's how he got himself
6430900	6432900	into the story about him
6432900	6434900	immersion
6434900	6436900	what do you call it
6436900	6438900	it goes to show it proves my point
6438900	6440900	basically I'm trying to establish a point
6440900	6442900	like I said before he's trying to be a part of the story
6442900	6444900	and that means he's got to elevate himself
6444900	6446900	he's got power and control over the story
6446900	6448900	that he's writing that's one thing
6448900	6450900	he's got control over me
6450900	6452900	so he's going to put himself in this position
6452900	6454900	put me down here
6454900	6456900	dismissing me makes me a terrible person
6456900	6458900	and asshole discredit me
6458900	6460900	and then he got himself into a story
6460900	6462900	about him owning a minivan
6462900	6464900	a knife whatever the fuck it was
6464900	6466900	doesn't matter he was in the story finally
6466900	6468900	all his life finally I'm in the New York Times
6468900	6470900	story about me is what he's thinking
6470900	6472900	right I know this fucking guy
6472900	6474900	so that he comes out and says that
6474900	6476900	he thinks it's cute and funny because that's not meant for me
6476900	6478900	that's not meant for you
6478900	6480900	that's meant for his friends at the New York Times
6480900	6482900	that comment right there
6482900	6484900	Michael Barbaro and the guy that he's with right now
6484900	6486900	and everyone he knows in the New York Times
6486900	6488900	that's what that is for
6488900	6490900	that's what that comes for
6490900	6492900	and that's trying to get a laugh from his colleagues
6492900	6494900	okay well I don't think they're gonna
6494900	6496900	laugh at this
6496900	6498900	but I don't think that is anything to do with you
6498900	6500900	or your dad
6500900	6502900	well for the last five years because that would seem to be the focus
6502900	6504900	this book will bring you money
6504900	6506900	I know but I hope probably not
6506900	6508900	but that's what it's meant for
6508900	6510900	in his head he's trying to get that
6510900	6512900	after that I worked for free
6512900	6514900	how much have I made
6514900	6516900	you didn't know what I made
6516900	6518900	I've never really seen
6518900	6520900	I've never fucking had
6520900	6522900	how do you get per month
6522900	6524900	from this project
6524900	6526900	my father
6526900	6528900	my documents
6528900	6530900	other than $5,000
6530900	6532900	thank you
6532900	6534900	that's another thing
6534900	6536900	why did you say thank you
6536900	6538900	you know Glenn Simpson paid me $5,000
6538900	6540900	why did you say pay me one
6540900	6542900	I believe it says
6542900	6544900	that he paid me one upfront
6544900	6546900	the rest of the $5,000
6546900	6548900	he owed you $10,000
6548900	6550900	he only paid you half of that
6550900	6552900	that means he paid you $5,000
6552900	6554900	but you said you paid me $1,000
6554900	6556900	no I said
6556900	6558900	just bring the documents right there
6558900	6560900	it's not
6560900	6562900	okay here's the one
6562900	6564900	the other big thing
6564900	6566900	this is the other big one
6566900	6568900	I don't want to pick everything
6568900	6570900	let me just give you the other big one
6570900	6572900	the other big one was Dan Gold
6572900	6574900	you have the recording
6574900	6576900	I made of Dan Goldman
6576900	6578900	and I screamed at each other
6578900	6580900	why is this important
6580900	6582900	okay so in the book
6582900	6584900	yeah in the book
6584900	6586900	and in the article
6586900	6588900	he says that
6588900	6590900	Dan Goldman
6590900	6592900	that I approached Dan Goldman
6592900	6594900	first of all
6594900	6596900	and the reason why I approached him
6596900	6598900	is because he asked me to
6598900	6600900	I approached Dan Goldman
6600900	6602900	for money
6602900	6604900	is it give me money or you don't get these documents
6604900	6606900	did you say that
6606900	6608900	no never once
6608900	6610900	no I haven't
6610900	6612900	really I see it for money
6612900	6614900	yes you did
6614900	6616900	but that didn't even mean me
6616900	6618900	I don't go around that's the fucking thing
6618900	6620900	who wants to do for money
6620900	6622900	I'm gonna offer you money
6622900	6624900	Glenn yes Glenn said I offer you $10,000
6624900	6626900	oh I understand
6626900	6628900	I'm gonna give you $10,000
6628900	6630900	$10,000
6630900	6632900	and it's because
6632900	6634900	what's your name
6634900	6636900	I'm gonna ask Glenn
6636900	6638900	I know a guy that's gonna
6638900	6640900	you don't know the fucking story
6640900	6642900	that's all I was referring to
6642900	6644900	the point is
6644900	6646900	Dan Goldman said
6646900	6648900	this is at least coming from David
6648900	6650900	and it is true because later
6650900	6652900	Dan will back us up
6652900	6654900	David says Val asked Dan Goldman
6654900	6656900	for a job
6656900	6658900	and then they subpoenaed him
6658900	6660900	that's what he said
6660900	6662900	and in the book
6662900	6664900	and there's a bunch of bullshit
6664900	6666900	and then later when article comes out
6666900	6668900	and I'm pissed off
6668900	6670900	and I'm like what the fuck is this shit
6670900	6672900	and I'm like David fuck you asshole
6672900	6674900	how could you do this to me
6674900	6676900	you fucking piece of shit asshole
6676900	6678900	you totally scream me over
6678900	6680900	you know what I think I was very fair
6680900	6682900	and here's an example look I left this out
6682900	6684900	because I thought it would be just too much
6684900	6686900	there was a press release saying
6686900	6688900	Val Brooksman was trying to extort us
6688900	6690900	and then we subpoenaed him
6690900	6692900	because we would refuse
6692900	6694900	to give him any money
6694900	6696900	that's what Dan Goldman said
6696900	6698900	I was like what the fuck
6698900	6700900	so I go scrolling through my text
6700900	6702900	and I find the ones with Dan Goldman
6702900	6704900	and I see and I bring it up and I send it to them
6704900	6706900	the ones with Dan Goldman said
6706900	6708900	what really happened I called Dan Goldman
6708900	6710900	and I'll give you the fucking files
6710900	6712900	I think I already sent them to you
6712900	6714900	okay
6714900	6716900	in the Dan Goldman conversation I said
6716900	6718900	dude give me, I'll work as an intern
6718900	6720900	just fucking let me have some oversight
6720900	6722900	you don't have to pay me
6722900	6724900	quote you don't have to pay me
6724900	6726900	how many times do I have to say
6726900	6728900	you don't have to pay me
6728900	6730900	and David surprised oh Valash says
6730900	6732900	pay me
6732900	6734900	I was like what the fuck
6734900	6736900	and you don't know the thing now
6736900	6738900	the reviews are coming
6738900	6740900	every single word about him
6740900	6742900	is
6742900	6744900	the last one
6744900	6746900	which I think is the Washington Post
6746900	6748900	and the New York Times says
6748900	6750900	he has been extorting money
6750900	6752900	to buy drugs yes
6752900	6754900	what the fuck are you showing it
6754900	6756900	I'll send it to you anyway
6756900	6758900	so that's the text
6758900	6760900	Dan Goldman
6760900	6762900	and the real story is I was trying to tell him
6762900	6764900	I said no I just want some oversight
6764900	6766900	into my father's stuff
6766900	6768900	into how his emails are used
6768900	6770900	could misuse them
6770900	6772900	could use them to profit on
6772900	6774900	and take them out of context
6774900	6776900	and talk shit about my father
6776900	6778900	so that's what I wanted
6778900	6780900	and I said well fine well fuck you
6780900	6782900	and said well we can always subpoena you
6782900	6784900	I said well good luck with that
6784900	6786900	and I'm just a guy you're going to subpoena me
6786900	6788900	and you look like an asshole subpoena me
6788900	6790900	and also you went to go meet David
6790900	6792900	secretly
6792900	6794900	to inquire about his stories I'm going to bring that up in a minute
6794900	6796900	and David went
6796900	6798900	to the side of the point
6798900	6800900	but he said four months later nice to meet you
6800900	6802900	and then I'm watching shit flail on national television
6802900	6804900	and he's fucking up
6804900	6806900	he doesn't have anything and I know it
6806900	6808900	and so I look it's like a fucking
6808900	6810900	I feel bad I'm like I should help
6810900	6812900	so I call up
6812900	6814900	I didn't call it I text him and I can give you all the fucking text about it
6814900	6816900	I text him
6816900	6818900	I text Dan Goldman
6818900	6820900	so look Dan we go on to a bad start here
6820900	6822900	you know
6822900	6824900	look I have a couple things I know are going to help you
6824900	6826900	send it to you one of them is to breach your boards
6826900	6828900	for fucking sake
6828900	6830900	you're going to like it let me just give it to you
6830900	6832900	but the thing is I'm working with David behind
6832900	6834900	so the only way to make this look good
6834900	6836900	is if you give me no choice please subpoena me
6836900	6838900	you couldn't be fucking clear
6838900	6840900	if you subpoena me now
6840900	6842900	I'll be able to give it to you right away
6842900	6844900	and he replies that's a great idea
6844900	6846900	we'll do that on Monday
6846900	6848900	then the following Monday
6848900	6850900	you can see subpoena as me
6850900	6852900	I didn't have the text I said that
6852900	6854900	I didn't have the text
6854900	6856900	I didn't know you
6856900	6858900	this is a much bigger
6858900	6860900	this is important
6860900	6862900	I need those
6862900	6864900	I need those tomorrow
6864900	6866900	fuck
6866900	6868900	we have a lot to cover tomorrow
6868900	6870900	I'll have to come back
6870900	6872900	but we need some time in between
6872900	6874900	we need to process this start editing
6874900	6876900	and then I'll know what I need to fill in
6876900	6878900	because I'm going to have to come back and get another two days with you guys
6878900	6880900	but it'll be good because
6880900	6882900	if we really air it
6882900	6884900	we'd give it some time
6884900	6886900	whatever you need to do
6886900	6888900	you do it
6888900	6890900	I don't know
6890900	6892900	that
6892900	6894900	the fallout
6894900	6896900	if this was wrong
6896900	6898900	this is how I'll know in the film
6898900	6900900	if David's reporting was wrong
6900900	6902900	or if the loaned documents exist
6902900	6904900	I don't think
6904900	6906900	someone will find those documents
6906900	6908900	within the next few weeks
6908900	6910900	or in the next two months
6910900	6912900	and that person will be here
6912900	6914900	I'm saying it's going to put eyes on it again
6914900	6916900	so
6916900	6918900	the shake up from this isn't over
6918900	6920900	I don't think your story is anywhere near over
6920900	6922900	I'm really hoping it is
6922900	6924900	I think it's nearing the final act
6924900	6926900	I think it's about to get real
6926900	6928900	or maybe it just
6928900	6930900	goes away
6930900	6932900	but again
6932900	6934900	the point is that David has mistakes
6934900	6936900	I was mad at him
6936900	6938900	he just got the text
6938900	6940900	and he even doubled down
6940900	6942900	by sending a letter
6942900	6944900	I already told him
6944900	6946900	I have to go see
6946900	6948900	I say give me money
6948900	6950900	I want to go give me your fucking money
6950900	6952900	I won't give you anything never once that I come up
6952900	6954900	in fact what I did say
6954900	6956900	was that Dan I want to work
6956900	6958900	in any capacity to have some oversight
6958900	6960900	into how my fathers emails are used
6960900	6962900	because they could be abused by anybody
6962900	6964900	the context is important
6964900	6966900	I will take a job as an intern
6966900	6968900	you can pay me zero
6968900	6970900	I will work for free
6970900	6972900	I will fetch coffee
6972900	6974900	I just want some say on how it's used
6974900	6976900	say them to take
6976900	6978900	and in your book
6978900	6980900	not the book
6980900	6982900	but your fucking art profile
6982900	6984900	you say Val has been
6984900	6986900	extorting Adam Schiff's people
6986900	6988900	asking for money
6988900	6990900	trying to get anything he can
6990900	6992900	extort
6992900	6994900	extort
6994900	6996900	somebody get him his work
6996900	6998900	right at the screen
6998900	7000900	sorry if I'm
7000900	7002900	saying something
7002900	7004900	but after that when you
7004900	7006900	printed it out
7006900	7008900	she said well actually
7008900	7010900	I have this letter from
7010900	7012900	David
7012900	7014900	wait
7014900	7016900	what am I looking for
7016900	7018900	David said
7018900	7020900	where are you
7020900	7022900	search extort
7022900	7024900	he doesn't say oh sorry
7024900	7026900	this is important because David
7026900	7028900	I was so mad at David I was texting him
7028900	7030900	I was texting him
7030900	7032900	find the section
7032900	7034900	I don't even know what I'm looking for here
7034900	7036900	this is probably the wrong story
7036900	7038900	tell me a fat story
7038900	7040900	listen
7040900	7042900	this was important
7042900	7044900	okay fine
7044900	7046900	maybe there's some
7046900	7048900	I can't remember
7048900	7050900	remember how angry I was
7050900	7052900	yeah
7052900	7054900	I'll never forget how
7054900	7056900	do you remember what you
7056900	7058900	copied and pasted
7058900	7060900	just let me finish
7060900	7062900	my sentence you might remember
7062900	7064900	you copied and pasted a press release
7064900	7066900	for Madame Schiff's people tango
7066900	7068900	about me
7068900	7070900	you said
7070900	7072900	something akin to Val
7072900	7074900	look how kind I am to you because I left this out
7074900	7076900	yeah that sounds about right
7076900	7078900	what did they say
7078900	7080900	it was an on the record statement they provided
7080900	7082900	I don't remember it was maybe
7082900	7084900	they had used the word extort is that possible
7084900	7086900	I don't remember
7086900	7088900	but I do have it and you have it in your emails too
7088900	7090900	it's a paraphrase because I didn't
7090900	7092900	my email might take me a while to find it
7092900	7094900	I didn't want to spend an hour
7094900	7096900	I'll give it to you and I'll give it to you as well
7096900	7098900	they said
7098900	7100900	what was the fuck I can't remember now
7100900	7102900	Val Brooks who came to us trying to get a job
7102900	7104900	maybe they didn't use the word extort
7104900	7106900	to extort us
7106900	7108900	and get money from us and we said no
7108900	7110900	yeah right so look Val
7110900	7112900	look how kind I was to you to leave this out
7112900	7114900	we subpoenaed him because
7114900	7116900	we didn't want to stand for his bullshit
7116900	7118900	or whatever it was
7118900	7120900	and so I'm like what the fuck I'm reading this
7120900	7122900	and he said look Val I'm so kind I didn't put this in
7122900	7124900	and then I said David something you don't know
7126900	7128900	and I sent you the text
7128900	7130900	and you said that you had basically
7130900	7132900	after the anger phone call
7132900	7134900	with him and with you and Goldman
7134900	7136900	that you would basically
7136900	7138900	I believe that you had
7138900	7140900	Marlo
7140900	7142900	please
7142900	7144900	don't kick him
7144900	7146900	I believe that
7146900	7148900	you had basically invited him to subpoena you
7148900	7150900	that's exactly right
7150900	7152900	that's what I did
7152900	7154900	Goldman after we had
7154900	7156900	you didn't stare with me just to be clear until after the article
7156900	7158900	that's right
7158900	7160900	because I didn't know that before
7160900	7162900	right but I let you know about it
7162900	7164900	so what happened was
7164900	7166900	Goldman I got a huge fight
7166900	7168900	and at the end of the day I said well you fucking subpoena me
7168900	7170900	then you know that's all
7170900	7172900	okay then I will
7172900	7174900	we don't talk for four months he isn't subpoena me
7174900	7176900	I look around and I see Adam Schiff
7176900	7178900	wavering on television he's not going anywhere
7178900	7180900	and I'm thinking you know what
7180900	7182900	maybe I can't help I'm feeling bad now
7182900	7184900	like no I have this one
7184900	7186900	document I know will help and this other one
7186900	7188900	maybe it will help
7188900	7190900	so I said I send him a text which I
7190900	7192900	you have copies of
7192900	7194900	I said look I'm really sorry
7194900	7196900	maybe we can work something else out
7196900	7198900	the thing is I'm dealing with the FBI
7198900	7200900	I'm helping them and I think it would be better
7200900	7202900	if you subpoenaed me
7202900	7204900	because that way I can tell the FBI I had no choice
7204900	7206900	and there are these two documents you're going to need
7206900	7208900	one is the breach report
7208900	7210900	and another one was this other thing
7210900	7212900	I can't really quite remember right now
7212900	7214900	but again it's in your text
7214900	7216900	and that says Val
7216900	7218900	yeah it sounds like a great idea let's do that
7218900	7220900	okay and then I was subpoena
7220900	7222900	the next following Monday
7222900	7224900	immediately and then I said thank you
7224900	7226900	and I gave him everything I could
7226900	7228900	and I said the FBI guys
7228900	7230900	they subpoenaed me so I'm sorry
7230900	7232900	there's nothing I can do about it
7232900	7234900	and so I gave it to him and that's how it worked
7234900	7236900	and then I showed you that story I told you
7236900	7238900	and you did nothing
7238900	7240900	you didn't take anything back you didn't write anything
7240900	7242900	you did nothing
7242900	7244900	I'm sorry
7244900	7246900	he did subpoena you
7246900	7248900	the way you frame it
7248900	7250900	in the story is not
7250900	7252900	can I start understanding you correctly
7252900	7254900	you're upset with me
7254900	7256900	because I didn't include
7256900	7258900	something that you deliberately
7258900	7260900	you didn't do your homework
7260900	7262900	you didn't do your fucking homework
7262900	7264900	you didn't do your research
7264900	7266900	you didn't talk to them you didn't get the truth
7266900	7268900	if you had told them dad he's not going to lie to you
7268900	7270900	you know dad
7270900	7272900	he's a douchebag dick
7272900	7274900	but he's the truth he's an honest guy
7274900	7276900	and he's respectable
7276900	7278900	he's respected for his honesty
7278900	7280900	and his prashness
7280900	7282900	and he would tell you the truth and you had to ask him
7282900	7284900	but you didn't
7284900	7286900	or maybe he did but left it out
7286900	7288900	just to be 100% clear
7288900	7290900	and I know this
7290900	7292900	I know this but just so the camera knows it too
7292900	7294900	you could have provided that to me
7294900	7296900	in real time
7296900	7298900	as I was writing the article
7298900	7300900	before the article ran
7300900	7302900	and you chose for whatever reason not to
7302900	7304900	you agree with that
7304900	7306900	I mean that's a
7306900	7308900	that's a good way
7308900	7310900	that's a good way about David's friends
7310900	7312900	things
7312900	7314900	that's a good example
7314900	7316900	I'm glad we got that on camera
7316900	7318900	that's a good example how you do this
7318900	7320900	here it's a little nasty to say that
7320900	7322900	because oh you knew I was writing
7322900	7324900	after people blah blah blah
7324900	7326900	well this article has been
7326900	7328900	edited for so long so
7328900	7330900	suddenly
7330900	7332900	you ever check if he did it for your narrative
7332900	7334900	or maybe he did but left it out
7334900	7336900	wait I don't know
7336900	7338900	just to be 100% clear
7338900	7340900	and I know this
7340900	7342900	I know this but just so the camera knows it too
7342900	7344900	you could have provided that to me
7344900	7346900	in real time
7346900	7348900	as I was writing the article before the article ran
7348900	7350900	and you chose for whatever reason not to
7350900	7352900	you agree with that
7352900	7354900	I mean that's a
7354900	7356900	that's a good way about David's friends
7356900	7358900	things
7358900	7360900	that's a good example
7360900	7362900	I'm glad we got that on camera
7362900	7364900	that's a good example how you do this
7364900	7366900	here it's a little nasty to say that
7366900	7368900	because oh you knew I was writing
7368900	7370900	after people blah blah blah
7370900	7372900	well this article has been
7372900	7374900	awaited for so long so
7374900	7376900	suddenly
7376900	7378900	a year and a half
7378900	7380900	you let me on for a year and a half
7380900	7382900	and what I wanted to say every three months
7382900	7384900	it's going to happen next month
7384900	7386900	next month it's going to change your life
7386900	7388900	but the point was
7388900	7390900	that as a response to your anger
7390900	7392900	was like look I got a letter
7392900	7394900	from these people and I believe them
7394900	7396900	right
7396900	7398900	and not you after five years
7398900	7400900	right after I never lied to you
7400900	7402900	and you heard the text
7402900	7404900	I mean the voice mail
7404900	7406900	yeah I thought you didn't have the truth
7406900	7408900	right there
7408900	7410900	you told a different story
7410900	7412900	can I say the word lie is that extreme
7412900	7414900	can I say the word lie
7414900	7416900	is that applicable here
7416900	7418900	can I say David's lie
7418900	7420900	I think that it just shows a trait
7420900	7422900	of character and choices
7422900	7424900	and it's just very concerning
7424900	7426900	irresponsible
7426900	7428900	yeah it's concerning
7428900	7430900	yeah well you guys
7430900	7432900	listen and there's more David
7432900	7434900	no no excuse me
7434900	7436900	please calm down David
7436900	7438900	listen David
7438900	7440900	remember when you met with them
7440900	7442900	in New York remember
7442900	7444900	sorry they came out to meet you in New York
7444900	7446900	goldman and global
7446900	7448900	remember this meeting
7448900	7450900	all I'm going to say about
7450900	7452900	I'm going to say one thing about them
7452900	7454900	I'll just say up front
7454900	7456900	the one thing I'm going to say about that meeting
7456900	7458900	other than that it did happen
7458900	7460900	is that they asked
7460900	7462900	from my opinion on you
7462900	7464900	and they gave me specific authorization
7464900	7466900	they put that part on the record
7466900	7468900	your credibility and if you had good stuff
7468900	7470900	so that's do you remember how pissed off you got
7470900	7472900	after reading that
7472900	7474900	that phone call because I said what did I say
7474900	7476900	I said what the fuck are two
7476900	7478900	lawyers from Washington coming up
7478900	7480900	and inquiring about a source
7480900	7482900	a New York Times writer giving up his source
7482900	7484900	why are they coming up there and why are you talking about me to them
7484900	7486900	I was livid about it
7486900	7488900	and then you reacted like I was the asshole
7488900	7490900	for bringing it up because that looks
7490900	7492900	really bad lawyers coming up
7492900	7494900	from DC to New York to talk
7494900	7496900	to a writer to inquire about his source
7496900	7498900	that's not really
7498900	7500900	the way I would characterize
7500900	7502900	okay well you clearly thought I was fucked up
7502900	7504900	that's quite clear
7504900	7506900	is anyone else think that's fucked up
7506900	7508900	is this normal behavior there's it
7508900	7510900	because I'm accusing him of giving up his source
7510900	7512900	lawyers in Washington
7512900	7514900	me the two lawyers
7514900	7516900	Dan Noble and Dan Goldman come up from Washington DC
7516900	7518900	and they ask about me
7518900	7520900	they inquire about your source
7520900	7522900	and he told them all about me
7522900	7524900	and he said to them
7524900	7526900	that Vau was difficult
7526900	7528900	so it was difficult
7528900	7530900	all that shit and he asked Dan Goldman
7530900	7532900	what he said and then
7532900	7534900	he said it was difficult
7534900	7536900	you think Dan Goldman will tell me the truth really
7536900	7538900	I think he will
7538900	7540900	well he's gonna spin it he writes down the truth
7540900	7542900	we have it though
7542900	7544900	we have it though
7544900	7546900	okay I'll send you the recording
7546900	7548900	that's another big favor
7548900	7550900	but this is a big one because you can get fired for that
7550900	7552900	why is that sitting downstairs
7552900	7554900	or is the editor in chief advice
7554900	7556900	hey editor in chief advice is that fucked up
7556900	7558900	you asshole bringing me in
7558900	7560900	he's not gonna say anything
7560900	7562900	but he's giving me the truth
7562900	7564900	but he needs to fuck up
7564900	7566900	David you burned me slanted me
7566900	7568900	you fucked me over
7568900	7570900	you left me out to dry
7570900	7572900	you did whatever you could to get ahead in your world
7572900	7574900	you used the fuck out of me
7574900	7576900	you used my father's emails
7576900	7578900	you used me
7578900	7580900	you could and you ran with it
7580900	7582900	and there were consequences to those actions
7582900	7584900	Tammy may not be fighting back like I am
7584900	7586900	Lauren whatever her name is
7586900	7588900	probably not and poor Tom Hayes
7588900	7590900	he's in fucking jail dude
7590900	7592900	14 years of jail
7592900	7594900	he's not gonna fight back and he's autistic too
7594900	7596900	and that was kind of an easy target wasn't it
7596900	7598900	you know about just
7598900	7600900	I am a grieving
7600900	7602900	son my father killed himself
7602900	7604900	I got a screw loose I'm sure
7604900	7606900	I've got my own problems
7606900	7608900	yes I enjoyed oxycodone
7608900	7610900	okay yes I enjoy drugs
7610900	7612900	and I like to party I like to have fun
7612900	7614900	and sometimes I think I'm funny enough
7614900	7616900	whatever but you took advantage of me too
7616900	7618900	you did
7618900	7620900	sorry for that one
7620900	7622900	I'm sure you're so sorry
7622900	7624900	I feel that way
7624900	7626900	I love that non-apology apology
7626900	7628900	I've already given a full-throated apology
7628900	7630900	for what I am actually saying
7630900	7632900	fuck your apology
7632900	7634900	and listen here are consequences to your actions
7634900	7636900	apologies words don't mean shit
7636900	7638900	actions mean things
7638900	7640900	my father how many times have I told you
7640900	7642900	what my father told me
7642900	7644900	how many times it doesn't matter
7644900	7646900	what people say you want to know
7646900	7648900	you stand with someone you look at what they do
7648900	7650900	don't even fucking listen to their words
7650900	7652900	do you remember that how many times I told you
7652900	7654900	you told me that a lot of times
7654900	7656900	so right that's what I'm going by right now
7656900	7658900	and look what you've done
7658900	7660900	which is what you said
7660900	7662900	and the problem is your words
7662900	7664900	they have a platform
7664900	7666900	okay they have a huge
7666900	7668900	powerful platform
7668900	7670900	a terribly fucking sword
7670900	7672900	that you yield
7672900	7674900	and you care less of it
7674900	7676900	and not just with me
7676900	7678900	but with other people care less of it
7678900	7680900	and you don't give a fuck about that
7680900	7682900	you only care about your next project
7682900	7684900	and what you're going to get
7684900	7686900	and what you can take from me
7686900	7688900	and what you took from me
7688900	7690900	I don't think I'm going to get that
7690900	7692900	no
7692900	7694900	so what do I do
7694900	7696900	do I do the forward
7696900	7698900	in my life
7698900	7700900	and forget all about it
7700900	7702900	you know my style
7702900	7704900	you know me a little bit
7704900	7706900	you know me a little bit
7706900	7708900	you know my style
7708900	7710900	I would say that isn't your style
7710900	7712900	you'd be correct
7712900	7714900	now I feel like let's take a break
7716900	7718900	I'm ready
7718900	7720900	I'm ready
7730900	7732900	what else do you have to say
7732900	7734900	what do you think
7734900	7736900	what do I think
7736900	7738900	why did you come
7738900	7740900	what do you think
7740900	7742900	what you're going to get out
7742900	7744900	and what you can take from me
7744900	7746900	and what you took from me
7746900	7748900	I don't think I'm going to get that
7748900	7750900	so what do I do
7750900	7752900	do I do the forward
7752900	7754900	in my life
7754900	7756900	what are you planning on doing
7756900	7758900	what do you mean
7758900	7760900	be transparent
7760900	7762900	what are you going to do
7762900	7764900	I need to organize this in my head
7764900	7766900	you don't know me yet
7766900	7768900	that's what I'm asking
7768900	7770900	you think I'm using this
7770900	7772900	in some sort of thing
7772900	7774900	I'm asking you
7774900	7776900	I'm telling you
7776900	7778900	we just need it for it
7778900	7780900	so I know what the fuck I said
7780900	7782900	so if I'm attacked
7782900	7784900	I can remember what the fuck I said
7784900	7786900	and I can remember what the fuck he said
7786900	7788900	sometimes in my head I mix things up
7788900	7790900	well there's a lot of shit
7790900	7792900	I don't know if David said
7792900	7794900	like the word for example
7794900	7796900	I fucked up with the word extort
7796900	7798900	like I was sure it was in his article
7798900	7800900	but it turns out the word extort was in
7800900	7802900	Dan Goldman's press release
7802900	7804900	fuck that one up
7804900	7806900	the word that he used
7806900	7808900	demanding money
7808900	7810900	demanding money
7810900	7812900	something similar to that
7812900	7814900	but anyway I just want to know this for my
7814900	7816900	my own stuff
7816900	7818900	and we like to
7818900	7820900	I like to listen to the recordings to figure out what the fuck
7820900	7822900	cause I get caught up in the moment
7822900	7824900	I don't remember it all
7824900	7826900	I don't understand some of the stuff
7826900	7828900	in the context
7828900	7830900	talking about it without a reference here
7830900	7832900	it would have been kind of impossible
7832900	7834900	I know yeah so I'm trying to give you that too
7834900	7836900	at the same time
7836900	7838900	and I'm going to send you the article
7838900	7840900	yeah we're sending all this stuff
7840900	7842900	and we're going to send him the recording to Dan Goldman
7842900	7844900	cause I have a decision to make
7844900	7846900	I think I definitely will go talk to David
7846900	7848900	if he'll let me at the time's office
7848900	7850900	because there's certainly
7850900	7852900	a lot of stuff that like
7852900	7854900	I don't have a checklist
7854900	7856900	of stuff that we will go through
7856900	7858900	that needs to be fact checked
7858900	7860900	and like you said
7860900	7862900	people get everything
7862900	7864900	with the questions
7864900	7866900	well
7866900	7868900	there's gotta be like 10
7868900	7870900	that's pretty easy
7870900	7872900	is that my style
7872900	7874900	you know me a little bit
7874900	7876900	I do know you a little bit
7876900	7878900	is that my style
7878900	7880900	I would say that
7880900	7882900	you'd be correct
7882900	7884900	good well let now
7884900	7886900	I feel like let's take a break
7886900	7888900	do you want some water
7888900	7890900	I'm fine I'm ready
7890900	7892900	but if you want to take a break
7892900	7894900	can I get some water
7894900	7896900	you want to yell David
7896900	7898900	you can yell David
7898900	7900900	I'll give you some
7900900	7902900	what else do you have to say
7902900	7904900	what do you think Dan
7904900	7906900	it doesn't matter
7906900	7908900	what do I think
7908900	7910900	why did you come in
7910900	7912900	what do you think
7912900	7914900	I'm good thank you
7914900	7916900	you guys
7916900	7918900	do you want some water
7918900	7920900	do you want some water
7920900	7922900	I know how
7922900	7924900	thank you
7924900	7926900	let's really talk
7926900	7928900	I don't have information
7928900	7930900	from this guy
7930900	7932900	well you can
7932900	7934900	I think we can cut around with you
7934900	7936900	I'm gonna ask
7936900	7938900	so you have more to say
7938900	7940900	the reason we came out here
7940900	7942900	you were gonna want
7942900	7944900	to rip into me a little bit
7944900	7946900	and obviously
7946900	7948900	that is your prerogative
7948900	7950900	so you have a massacist
7950900	7952900	no Val
7952900	7954900	because honestly
7954900	7956900	now it's not a massacist
7956900	7958900	it's a sense that
7958900	7960900	you have a great story
7960900	7962900	and I want to share your story
7962900	7964900	with as many people as possible
7964900	7966900	and there's no better way to do that
7966900	7968900	than hearing it straight out of your mouth
7968900	7970900	and
7970900	7972900	this is your opportunity to do that
7972900	7974900	so if you want to move
7974900	7976900	my opportunity
7976900	7978900	do you have the way you frame it
7978900	7980900	to my opportunity to do that with you
7980900	7982900	you're giving me such a big value
7982900	7984900	to me in this opportunity
7984900	7986900	it's not me
7986900	7988900	do you see how I could pick that up
7988900	7990900	as offensive
7990900	7992900	not really honestly but yes
7992900	7994900	I understand
7994900	7996900	I'm not trying to be offensive about
7996900	7998900	I'm just honestly trying to
7998900	8000900	if you would like
8000900	8002900	to tell your story
8002900	8004900	the place I would like to start
8004900	8006900	is offering you
8006900	8008900	I would just like to hear you
8008900	8010900	talk about your dad a little bit
8010900	8012900	and tell us who was Bill Brooksman
8012900	8014900	we'll get there baby
8014900	8016900	we'll get there
8016900	8018900	now right now I'm a little upset with you
8018900	8020900	and I need to air this
8020900	8022900	grievance with you
8022900	8024900	it's very important for me
8024900	8026900	I can tell
8026900	8028900	why you wanted me to talk about your father
8028900	8030900	I'm very curious about your intentions
8030900	8032900	I'm thinking why is he coming
8032900	8034900	do you mind if I just cut that
8034900	8036900	this was a story
8036900	8038900	that David didn't
8038900	8040900	pitch it to us or anything
8040900	8042900	I found
8042900	8044900	I was really intrigued by
8044900	8046900	the more I read about your story
8046900	8048900	we tell stories about the news
8048900	8050900	yours is a perfect example
8050900	8052900	of that you have an incredible
8052900	8054900	story that we're able to tell
8054900	8056900	and people understand
8056900	8058900	what's happening in the news
8058900	8060900	and so that's
8060900	8062900	my goal here
8062900	8064900	is to get the story from your mouth
8064900	8066900	the more that we get from you
8066900	8068900	of your own story the less that we have to rely on David
8068900	8070900	to tell it
8070900	8072900	I like the sound of that
8072900	8074900	Marlo please
8074900	8076900	Marie please
8076900	8078900	that's a great
8078900	8080900	I can't even hear
8080900	8082900	sorry Eric
8082900	8084900	just to give you an idea
8084900	8086900	we're interested in starting from your childhood
8086900	8088900	learning more about your relationship with your dad
8088900	8090900	and hearing about
8090900	8092900	your quest to
8092900	8094900	get some understanding about this thing
8094900	8096900	to have it in your life
8096900	8098900	David's here
8100900	8102900	David as the
8102900	8104900	reporter who's done most of the reporting
8104900	8106900	until this point
8106900	8108900	so with
8108900	8110900	you writing the profile
8110900	8112900	so what did you think of
8112900	8114900	you didn't even know about me
8114900	8116900	yeah I mean I was intrigued by
8116900	8118900	your story
8118900	8120900	I just thought it was compelling
8120900	8122900	knowing how writers write
8122900	8124900	and how this industry works
8124900	8126900	in the New York Times as you read the story
8126900	8128900	you're like oh this is a bit on the negative side
8128900	8130900	right
8130900	8132900	I had the same thing
8132900	8134900	I don't know if I feel comfortable
8134900	8136900	making that judgment
8136900	8138900	let's pretend this is the answer
8138900	8140900	okay so let's say I felt this is a little negative
8140900	8142900	maybe it's a bit more one sided
8142900	8144900	than I thought
8144900	8146900	maybe it would be good to hear the other story
8146900	8148900	yeah I mean our whole goal
8148900	8150900	is for your voice to be
8150900	8152900	if that's the truth to me yes I would be happy
8152900	8154900	yeah yeah I mean it absolutely is
8154900	8156900	I can tell you that 100%
8156900	8158900	okay so with David
8158900	8160900	you know I don't
8160900	8162900	I'm just a bit upset
8162900	8164900	yeah I'm totally upset
8164900	8166900	and I feel used
8166900	8168900	and it felt like I was
8168900	8170900	I feel like I was fucking betrayed
8170900	8172900	when he was there
8172900	8174900	you know I called you a friend
8174900	8176900	and I will never do that again
8176900	8178900	so
8178900	8180900	no I don't need you
8180900	8182900	to be my friend
8182900	8184900	well we're not friends you're
8184900	8186900	you're not a journalist
8186900	8188900	I can't count the number of times I've said that to you
8188900	8190900	okay and I can't count the number of times you said
8190900	8192900	oh I'm gonna see you a friend
8192900	8194900	this is what friends do
8194900	8196900	fuck's sake David
8196900	8198900	oh my god I know so many other people
8198900	8200900	it's just your
8200900	8202900	I mean I know you're on the spot
8202900	8204900	and it's tough
8204900	8206900	and you're being attacked
8206900	8208900	and your defenses are up
8208900	8210900	I get that and I'm taking advantage of that too
8210900	8212900	I'm sure you know this
8212900	8214900	this is a part of my revenge
8214900	8216900	okay this is a small part of my revenge
8216900	8218900	but
8218900	8220900	I am upset and it's very hard for me
8220900	8222900	to talk about something dear to me
8222900	8224900	this is my father
8224900	8226900	what I feel like this person
8226900	8228900	is going to
8228900	8230900	sabotage take it from me
8230900	8232900	rip it and abuse it and pervert it in some way
8232900	8234900	you know I know that now
8234900	8236900	since it's on the record there's no way he's going to be able to get away with it
8236900	8238900	but I still don't feel
8240900	8242900	safety
8242900	8244900	I felt before
8244900	8246900	you know
8246900	8248900	generally I love talking about my father
8248900	8250900	you know
8250900	8252900	but now right now
8252900	8254900	I think maybe we should
8254900	8256900	maybe save it for tomorrow
8256900	8258900	I mean if that's two or three hours later
8258900	8260900	I can't
8260900	8262900	we just need to save some time
8262900	8264900	of course
8264900	8266900	we have two days that's why we wanted to take advantage of that
8266900	8268900	so
8268900	8270900	I mean if you feel like we can be better
8270900	8272900	like the air is more clear for tomorrow
8272900	8274900	yeah just some time prior when we breathe
8274900	8276900	that more goes to the corners
8276900	8278900	have the coaches
8278900	8280900	have the water in their faces
8280900	8282900	and so we come out without guns
8282900	8284900	yeah
8284900	8286900	I mean so do you feel like
8286900	8288900	you've said what you needed to say
8288900	8290900	today
8290900	8292900	Ray what do you think
8292900	8294900	do you remember
8294900	8296900	is there anything else you wanted to say
8296900	8298900	I have this much on
8298900	8300900	but I don't know
8300900	8302900	no no
8302900	8304900	because you're just affected
8304900	8306900	just as much as I was
8306900	8308900	remember it wasn't just me that got
8308900	8310900	screwed over here in fact
8310900	8312900	it was a lot of people
8312900	8314900	so Marie do you have anything to say please
8314900	8316900	no I just
8316900	8318900	I mean to me it's just
8318900	8320900	as I said
8320900	8322900	I've known both of them
8322900	8324900	the same teacher
8324900	8326900	I just want to say
8326900	8328900	I need to talk to his father
8328900	8330900	actually
8330900	8332900	use this
8332900	8334900	against me
8334900	8336900	very
8336900	8338900	very
8338900	8340900	intensely
8340900	8342900	on his favor of course
8342900	8344900	and
8344900	8346900	I will not
8346900	8348900	hear the end of it
8348900	8350900	every time I have him on the phone
8350900	8352900	or I see him
8352900	8354900	or you see him
8354900	8356900	it's another set of
8356900	8358900	humiliation
8358900	8360900	I've had people come up to me
8360900	8362900	saying
8362900	8364900	our children are friends
8364900	8366900	but I think it's best
8366900	8368900	we start being friends
8368900	8370900	so I had a lot of friends
8370900	8372900	in LA
8372900	8374900	I don't have them anymore
8376900	8378900	I mean
8378900	8380900	this guy is a bad guy
8380900	8382900	I mean this is another person I know
8382900	8384900	and I was saying that
8384900	8386900	I mean I think
8386900	8388900	even Allah would not believe it
8388900	8390900	like she would not believe it
8390900	8392900	Allah is the only
8392900	8394900	Oh sorry
8394900	8396900	and that's
8398900	8400900	to me it's like
8400900	8402900	I'm kind of a pessimist
8402900	8404900	and he's an eternal
8404900	8406900	optimist
8406900	8408900	and it's very
8408900	8410900	charming but
8410900	8412900	I was always careful
8412900	8414900	and just you know I don't say everything
8414900	8416900	way to day
8416900	8418900	and these and that
8418900	8420900	I would always tell her
8420900	8422900	I trust David please
8422900	8424900	trust me that I trust him
8424900	8426900	you know me
8426900	8428900	he's okay
8428900	8430900	I said over and over to her
8430900	8432900	and everybody met
8432900	8434900	you were like the greatest
8434900	8436900	I was crying
8436900	8438900	and if somebody had something bad
8438900	8440900	several times
8440900	8442900	but David

8508900	8510900	you know
8510900	8512900	did you really think I would let this slide
8514900	8516900	I think the book reflects really well on you though
8516900	8518900	and it
8518900	8520900	I think
8520900	8522900	I don't know if you've read it
8522900	8524900	I've told you I've read it
8524900	8526900	around to him
8526900	8528900	I read it myself
8528900	8530900	then I read it around because
8530900	8532900	it was too painful for him to read it
8532900	8534900	so
8534900	8536900	yeah I can imagine these are like
8536900	8538900	really painful events for you
8538900	8540900	it wasn't that it was you
8540900	8542900	you can still see it in the book
8542900	8544900	like what
8544900	8546900	like what in the book
8546900	8548900	I know I'm a
8548900	8550900	meandering sort of
8550900	8552900	idiotic
8552900	8554900	asshole that you're hopeless
8554900	8556900	these were hopeless
8556900	8558900	and I had to go down all the time
8558900	8560900	careless with people
8560900	8562900	and really I was mean to my mother
8562900	8564900	yeah for
8564900	8566900	for Allah
8566900	8568900	yes it's terrible
8568900	8570900	you couldn't stop yourself
8570900	8572900	then sending me money to him
8572900	8574900	he doesn't do anything
8574900	8576900	he couldn't handle the money anyway
8578900	8580900	I'm not sure how
8580900	8582900	my guess is you got a hold of a book
8582900	8584900	a version of the book that was sent to
8584900	8586900	and Roxanne
8586900	8588900	probably
8588900	8590900	no no
8590900	8592900	yes you do
8596900	8598900	so that's what it doesn't make sense
8598900	8600900	that's the secret
8600900	8602900	but you get what I'm saying
8602900	8604900	it doesn't make sense
8604900	8606900	with how he's claiming
8606900	8608900	you never said that to Odessa
8608900	8610900	Odessa's saying she didn't say that
8610900	8612900	but she leaked your book
8612900	8614900	oh yeah
8614900	8616900	she has no clue
8616900	8618900	well then you know what
8618900	8620900	there you go
8620900	8622900	I'm just saying
8622900	8624900	the fact that she had the book
8624900	8626900	I didn't tell you
8626900	8628900	I understand
8628900	8630900	I understand
8630900	8632900	actually his moral
8632900	8634900	made him hesitate until
8634900	8636900	the very very last minute
8636900	8638900	because he was
8638900	8640900	I mean even last night I had an argument with you
8640900	8642900	is he still defending you
8642900	8644900	yeah I can't believe I caught myself defending
8644900	8646900	I said you were right
8646900	8648900	you were right
8648900	8650900	it was like instinct to just defend it
8650900	8652900	I said no David it wasn't
8652900	8654900	well from whatever it was the guys
8654900	8656900	the people who don't have a stake in this one were the other
8656900	8658900	and I very much do have a stake in it
8658900	8660900	obviously you guys do too
8660900	8662900	who don't know you
8662900	8664900	who don't really know me
8664900	8666900	and have read it think that
8666900	8668900	they have a very different read on
8668900	8670900	every time I see a review
8670900	8672900	I don't see my name
8672900	8674900	I don't see my father's name
8674900	8676900	I see a blurb that says
8676900	8678900	David's exposing Deutsche Bank
8678900	8680900	stay tuned for more Deutsche Bank
8680900	8682900	and more terrible things
8682900	8684900	and I'm supposed to be the main character right
8684900	8686900	you're a main character
8686900	8688900	you're a dad or probably the main character
8688900	8690900	that was a mention of us
8690900	8692900	and why am I not on the back of the book
8692900	8694900	where's the description
8694900	8696900	if I am such a main character
8696900	8698900	tell me about it
8698900	8700900	the banker's son
8700900	8702900	was not the original title
8702900	8704900	that was the title I started with
8704900	8706900	but that was what I got
8706900	8708900	regret telling you that about me
8708900	8710900	because I told you at the time
8710900	8712900	that that was definitely something
8712900	8714900	that we were toying with that might not happen
8714900	8716900	but I'm just looking at actually the back of the book
8716900	8718900	where it's described as
8718900	8720900	father-son drama
8720900	8722900	it's
8722900	8724900	it's very much
8724900	8726900	about you and about your father
8726900	8728900	I don't think anyone
8728900	8730900	is my name in there
8730900	8732900	we're on the back of the book
8732900	8734900	we're just there with the index
8734900	8736900	we're just a main character
8736900	8738900	but usually they would be in the description
8738900	8740900	so this is what the book's about
8740900	8742900	we had an agreement
8742900	8744900	did we not that the book was going to be about my father
8744900	8746900	and my journey mostly
8746900	8748900	over the course of the last five years
8748900	8750900	of what I've discovered
8750900	8752900	through my eyes
8752900	8754900	that's definitely the bulk of the book
8754900	8756900	that's also what you pitched in New York Times
8756900	8758900	because you sent me the
8758900	8760900	what the pitch that you sent in New York Times
8760900	8762900	and you sent me the pitch that you sent to our colleagues
8762900	8764900	and both of them said
8764900	8766900	okay that the book was about me
8766900	8768900	and my father and the journey that I've been through
8768900	8770900	and I told you back through my eyes
8770900	8772900	okay that is not what I read
8772900	8774900	well that is a very different book
8774900	8776900	I'm not sure what you read Val
8776900	8778900	but the I
8778900	8780900	look let's just let the book speak for itself then
8780900	8782900	because I don't think
8782900	8784900	any person
8784900	8786900	who reads that book will possibly
8786900	8788900	come away with agreements
8788900	8790900	except for the fact that you are not
8790900	8792900	by name
8792900	8794900	you ignore your dad I believe
8794900	8796900	it's prominently mentioned by name
8796900	8798900	on the jacket of the book
8798900	8800900	right and if
8800900	8802900	the tables return we should be a bit upset
8802900	8804900	honestly if I was just in this
8804900	8806900	to have my dad's legacy
8806900	8808900	every time you say I'm on the side
8808900	8810900	of the word honestly
8812900	8814900	if I was just concerned about
8814900	8816900	my dad's legacy and I read this book
8816900	8818900	I think I would be pretty
8818900	8820900	pretty content with it
8820900	8822900	and what did I say earlier on
8822900	8824900	I said you did a good job with my father
8824900	8826900	and respected him
8826900	8828900	and I was appreciated
8828900	8830900	so let's not lose sight of him
8830900	8832900	no I didn't lose sight of him
8832900	8834900	but me it's another story
8834900	8836900	I do have to defend myself too
8836900	8838900	and I talk all over
8838900	8840900	and I refuse to
8840900	8842900	and I'm not going to let it happen
8842900	8844900	and this whole thing right here
8844900	8846900	who is this benefit
8846900	8848900	who is this benefit
8848900	8850900	wait one way please
8850900	8852900	who is this benefit
8852900	8854900	what's this
8854900	8856900	the day the podcast
8856900	8858900	who does it benefit
8858900	8860900	does it benefit me or you
8860900	8862900	you have a book to sell
8862900	8864900	it doesn't matter
8864900	8866900	it's not the same days your book
8866900	8868900	it's coming out but this benefit too
8868900	8870900	what does what mean
8870900	8872900	why do they do this then
8872900	8874900	they can't say that they're promoting the book
8874900	8876900	they can't say
8876900	8878900	it benefits one of the writers
8878900	8880900	but he said this is not coming out
8880900	8882900	around the release of the book
8882900	8884900	he's lying
8884900	8886900	it's an obvious lie
8886900	8888900	it's a weird lie because everyone knows it's not
8888900	8890900	if he said mid-march though I'm saying that the release date
8890900	8892900	the book is released February 18th
8892900	8894900	that's very soon
8894900	8896900	I know because
8896900	8898900	I think they are going to be in mid-march
8898900	8900900	so I'm wondering if he has another story
8900900	8902900	yeah but imagine you have a book coming out in February
8902900	8904900	then you have a relance
8904900	8906900	a rebound
8906900	8908900	of promotion
8908900	8910900	I get that part
8910900	8912900	but I've never seen the Times do that
8912900	8914900	without something in tandem in the paper
8914900	8916900	and I've checked and that's every episode
8916900	8918900	of the Daily has like a
8918900	8920900	unless it's like a
8920900	8922900	political rally or something
8922900	8924900	yes the last time you did it
8924900	8926900	with a different podcast there was the story about the Hitch Bank
8926900	8928900	and I was commemorating and he promoted the book
8928900	8930900	we didn't say anything about us
8930900	8932900	so he already did one right
8932900	8934900	okay so maybe you're right about the rebound then
8934900	8936900	yes of course
8936900	8938900	I just feel like he's going to have another story
8938900	8940900	it's possible we'll see
8940900	8942900	he'll just copy and paste from the book
8942900	8944900	he's going to do the same though
8944900	8946900	he's going to do like the first one
8946900	8948900	what are you talking about
8948900	8950900	first person, immersive
8950900	8952900	I apologize
8952900	8954900	that would be fantastic
8954900	8956900	it's going to be the same month as my book
8956900	8958900	this benefits you David
8958900	8960900	this helps your books
8960900	8962900	arguing, it's fun
8962900	8964900	readers will listen and they'll say oh my god
8964900	8966900	Foul's an asshole or David's an asshole
8966900	8968900	whatever but the fact is they're talking
8968900	8970900	about it and they're like oh let's see
8970900	8972900	about this book maybe we can find out more
8972900	8974900	alright so maybe the book isn't
8974900	8976900	good enough or interesting enough
8976900	8978900	and so maybe you need this little fiasco
8978900	8980900	to help some bookstores
8980900	8982900	who knows I'm just
8982900	8984900	I'm not saying it's true I'm just spitballing here
8984900	8986900	maybe this is going to benefit you in that way
8986900	8988900	maybe you said let's go out to California
8988900	8990900	and have Foul yell at me because this can be
8990900	8992900	critical to see
8992900	8994900	maybe no you mean this
8994900	8996900	yes maybe I can get Foul again
8996900	8998900	you know put him in his place
8998900	9000900	I mean Foul's a no good dude
9000900	9002900	is it
9002900	9004900	idiotic drug addict asshole
9004900	9006900	I mean whatever the fuck you've said about me
9006900	9008900	you probably
9008900	9010900	didn't do any research
9010900	9012900	or doesn't care
9012900	9014900	he's probably going to wake up to you
9014900	9016900	he's always David coming today I forgot all about it
9016900	9018900	and then you can do whatever the fuck you want
9018900	9020900	I predicted there's going to be a camera failure
9020900	9022900	he didn't he said 10%
9022900	9024900	you're right that's true
9024900	9026900	I predicted there'd be a camera failure
9026900	9028900	I said no he didn't he said there'd be a 10% chance
9028900	9030900	because you're right I did
9030900	9032900	it's good if you got him
9032900	9034900	I said
9034900	9036900	do you want to know how I describe you to
9036900	9038900	strongest man
9038900	9040900	I was like were you talking about it
9040900	9042900	he's like yeah we were
9042900	9044900	because the daily always does that stuff
9044900	9046900	we're in the car we're arriving at the Vogue Schmidt's house
9046900	9048900	like I asked him if we did that
9048900	9050900	and he's like yeah yeah we did that
9050900	9052900	so I know that I know they're going to include it
9052900	9054900	but they kind of have to include me asking them
9054900	9056900	too if they're going to talk about
9056900	9058900	the film crew you know like
9058900	9060900	so I hope they give me some promotion
9060900	9062900	that's why you need to look
9062900	9064900	intelligent, articulate
9064900	9066900	charismatic and charming
9066900	9068900	where is that in the profile
9068900	9070900	why is that not in the profile
9070900	9072900	I get to think that some of those words
9072900	9074900	feel like are in the profile
9074900	9076900	it's not
9076900	9078900	not one compliment or nice
9078900	9080900	everything a pejority
9080900	9082900	we went through friends with every single fucking word you wrote
9082900	9084900	you didn't say one time
9084900	9086900	I don't think that's true
9086900	9088900	did you read what we sent you
9088900	9090900	we went through it word for word
9090900	9092900	can you show me one nice word
9092900	9094900	can you show me one time Dini said
9094900	9096900	if you just told him I'm sure I can
9096900	9098900	okay do it
9098900	9100900	I don't have internet
9100900	9102900	I'm not walking to your house
9102900	9104900	ladies and gentlemen of the world
9104900	9106900	the wifi password here is
9106900	9108900	Olive Airplane 370
9108900	9110900	I'm not allowed to have your wifi thanks
9110900	9112900	that's the smartest thing you said on that
9112900	9114900	you want to have the air flow
9114900	9116900	on your device
9116900	9118900	I'm happy
9118900	9120900	I'm happy
9120900	9122900	I'm happy
9122900	9124900	I just realized that was good
9124900	9126900	now you have the Russians
9126900	9128900	you have the Russians don't you
9128900	9130900	I'm happy
9130900	9132900	he probably
9132900	9134900	he probably completely
9134900	9136900	didn't do any research or
9136900	9138900	doesn't care he's probably going to wake up and tell you
9138900	9140900	it's Dave you're coming today I forgot all about it
9140900	9142900	and then you can do whatever the fuck you want
9142900	9144900	I predicted there's going to be a camera for you
9144900	9146900	you're right
9146900	9148900	that's true
9148900	9150900	do you want to know how I describe you to
9150900	9152900	strangers
9152900	9154900	intelligent, articulate
9154900	9156900	charismatic
9156900	9158900	and charming
9158900	9160900	why is that not in the profile
9160900	9162900	I usually think that some of those words
9162900	9164900	are in the profile
9164900	9166900	it's not
9166900	9168900	not one compliment
9168900	9170900	or nice everything of the choreo
9170900	9172900	we went through friends of the every single fucking word
9172900	9174900	you wrote
9174900	9176900	I don't think that's true
9176900	9178900	did you read what we sent you
9178900	9180900	we went through it word for word
9180900	9182900	can you show me one nice word
9182900	9184900	can you show me one thing you said
9184900	9186900	I'm sure I can
9186900	9188900	I don't have internet
9188900	9190900	you don't have internet
9190900	9192900	ladies and gentlemen of the world
9192900	9194900	the wifi password here
9194900	9196900	is oliveairplane370
9196900	9198900	I'm not allowed to have your wifi
9198900	9200900	thanks
9200900	9202900	that's the smartest thing you said on that
9202900	9204900	you learned the article on your
9204900	9206900	on your device
9206900	9208900	I'm happy
9208900	9210900	I'm happy
9210900	9212900	see that's funny
9212900	9214900	it's only funny when it's on camera
9214900	9216900	what were you saying
9216900	9218900	there's tennis in this picture
9218900	9220900	you say you describe this
9220900	9222900	these time words
9222900	9224900	this is how you describe me
9224900	9226900	that's not how you describe it to the world
9226900	9228900	maybe in private you say this
9228900	9230900	this is the world
9230900	9232900	this isn't just
9232900	9234900	Ricky Dinky's spot in Swaziland
9234900	9236900	like I said before
9236900	9238900	or even a regional paper
9238900	9240900	or just America
9240900	9242900	this is the world
9242900	9244900	billions of people
9244900	9246900	and you're careless
9246900	9248900	you fucked up
9250900	9252900	and you will pay the consequences of that
9252900	9254900	whatever that looks like
9254900	9256900	you know
9256900	9258900	and I'm angry
9258900	9260900	obviously
9260900	9262900	so
9262900	9264900	I would love to talk about my father
9264900	9266900	but I can't do it
9266900	9268900	we should come back
9268900	9270900	tomorrow do you think
9270900	9272900	there's a little earlier
9272900	9274900	we can do like noon
9274900	9276900	maybe 11 let's try for 11
9276900	9278900	I don't have to do it 11
9278900	9280900	so there's
9280900	9282900	I could do
9282900	9284900	that's probably the best
9284900	9286900	yeah
9286900	9288900	we don't want to take up your whole day
9288900	9290900	we don't want to try to
9290900	9292900	are you taking up more than a day
9292900	9294900	well Eric hasn't done anything
9294900	9296900	no
9296900	9298900	it's taking up five years of my life
9298900	9300900	well actually David's only taken up two and a half
9300900	9302900	but yes
9302900	9304900	I think I can do another day
9304900	9306900	okay so let's find for noon
9306900	9308900	tomorrow
9308900	9310900	okay
9310900	9312900	I mean do you have any questions for me
9312900	9314900	that you want to
9314900	9316900	I didn't really do any background
9316900	9318900	I mean just about what we want
9318900	9320900	from you or what the hopes
9320900	9322900	for the story are
9322900	9324900	basically
9324900	9326900	we
9326900	9328900	we generally don't show people
9328900	9330900	our list of questions but the thrust of the story
9330900	9332900	is your childhood
9332900	9334900	your relationship to your dad
9334900	9336900	how you came to understand his role
9336900	9338900	at Deutsche Bank when you were young
9338900	9340900	obviously when you were talking about
9340900	9342900	your suicide
9342900	9344900	you discovering that
9344900	9346900	and then basically the thrust of the episode
9346900	9348900	is you trying to figure out
9348900	9350900	or trying to get a satisfactory answer
9350900	9352900	a satisfactory as you can
9352900	9354900	for why he killed himself
9354900	9356900	and then along the way
9356900	9358900	we're learning things about Deutsche Bank
9358900	9360900	and about things that are in the news
9360900	9362900	do you have that certain in you
9362900	9364900	sure
9364900	9366900	okay
9366900	9368900	this makes sense
9368900	9370900	okay
9370900	9372900	this makes sense because he says they have breaking news
9372900	9374900	so this will be
9374900	9376900	you'll be one of many characters that are
9376900	9378900	around the book but
9378900	9380900	it will probably be a second wave
9380900	9382900	what do you say? there'll be a breaking news that
9382900	9384900	somehow this podcast fits around
9384900	9386900	where do you get that from?
9386900	9388900	because he says your breaking news is short
9388900	9390900	what does he say?
9390900	9392900	I ask him do you want some breaking news as well?
9392900	9394900	yeah sure
9394900	9396900	I think you may
9396900	9398900	but also before you hit play
9398900	9400900	why don't you get Scott some breaking news tomorrow?
9400900	9402900	well before any news breaks
9402900	9404900	the reason what we said to him
9404900	9406900	you think all of us at the Georgia
9406900	9408900	we didn't say one nice thing which is true
9408900	9410900	we went through it word by word
9410900	9412900	and then I said didn't you get what we sent you
9412900	9414900	because you probably don't understand what that is
9414900	9416900	so we went through it word by word
9416900	9418900	and we wrote everything out
9418900	9420900	like what is mischaracterization
9420900	9422900	what is accurate and what's inaccurate
9422900	9424900	and we sent it to him
9424900	9426900	and to Nick Summers
9426900	9428900	and his editor and other women
9428900	9430900	which I guess is on another
9430900	9432900	the one you didn't bring
9432900	9434900	the part you didn't bring
9434900	9436900	it must be all in there and when we talked about her
9436900	9438900	yeah I remember that
9438900	9440900	so we'll give that to you too if you want it
9440900	9442900	and how much time before
9442900	9444900	they came did you send to a week?
9444900	9446900	right after the article
9446900	9448900	not to the daily though
9448900	9450900	you sent it to
9450900	9452900	and as a people
9452900	9454900	I thought you were sending it to the producer before he came
9454900	9456900	no no no
9456900	9458900	David is not that for three months
9458900	9460900	after the article
9460900	9462900	was published in your times
9462900	9464900	we went through it and we sent it to David
9464900	9466900	and his editors
9466900	9468900	yeah and that's when you had the call about like oh technically
9468900	9470900	yes yes yes
9470900	9472900	okay I understand
9472900	9474900	we're trying to get a satisfactory answer
9474900	9476900	as satisfactory as you can
9476900	9478900	for why he killed himself
9478900	9480900	and then you know along the way
9480900	9482900	we're learning things about Deutsche Bank
9482900	9484900	and about things that are in the news
9484900	9486900	do you have that statement?
9486900	9488900	sure
9488900	9490900	I don't know
9490900	9492900	but I'll give it to you
9492900	9494900	can I say anything to finish?
9494900	9496900	I'm sorry I've interjected too many times
9496900	9498900	and stopped myself many times
9500900	9502900	we've had many conversations
9502900	9504900	many
9504900	9506900	and you put me
9506900	9508900	one time in the book
9508900	9510900	I'm only in three pages
9510900	9512900	in the book
9512900	9514900	and the only quote I've decided to use
9514900	9516900	is a negative quote which I don't even
9516900	9518900	think
9518900	9520900	I've said
9520900	9522900	I know exactly what you're talking about
9522900	9524900	and of all the things
9524900	9526900	I've told you about
9526900	9528900	that's what you've decided to put
9528900	9530900	everything
9530900	9532900	the first day I met you at that cafe
9532900	9534900	in New York
9534900	9536900	beautiful things about him
9536900	9538900	and our meeting and everything
9538900	9540900	and at that time
9540900	9542900	some red flags really came to my head
9542900	9544900	because you said
9544900	9546900	well you're the first person that has
9546900	9548900	so many positive things to say about
9548900	9550900	and I was like
9550900	9552900	oh that's odd
9552900	9554900	first of all
9554900	9556900	why would you say that to me?
9556900	9558900	if it was true
9558900	9560900	why would you say that to a woman
9560900	9562900	that is telling you about
9562900	9564900	that and she's enamored
9564900	9566900	I mean that's
9566900	9568900	disturbing
9568900	9570900	and over
9570900	9572900	the last two years
9572900	9574900	I've told you so many good things about him
9574900	9576900	and you've only chosen
9576900	9578900	one sentence
9578900	9580900	that says
9580900	9582900	nothing about our relationship
9582900	9584900	or about who he is
9584900	9586900	and I've given you some insight about
9586900	9588900	him and his personality I think
9588900	9590900	you have Marie
9590900	9592900	a lot of our conversations have been off the record
9592900	9594900	no that's not true
9594900	9596900	really? are you saying our conversations
9596900	9598900	have all been on the record?
9598900	9600900	when was the last time we spoke?
9600900	9602900	I had not
9602900	9604900	your email after mine
9604900	9606900	it's like obviously we've been chatting
9606900	9608900	and obviously you
9608900	9610900	putting all the
9610900	9612900	negative things in there
9612900	9614900	that makes you also
9614900	9616900	Marie if you want our conversations to all be on the record
9616900	9618900	that's fine but they're not right now
9618900	9620900	and you should just
9620900	9622900	is that why you decided
9622900	9624900	of all the conversations we've had
9624900	9626900	you've decided to use
9626900	9628900	a quote that is negative
9628900	9630900	about how?
9630900	9632900	I don't think the quote was negative about that
9632900	9634900	what was the quote? something to be effective
9634900	9636900	right when you first met
9636900	9638900	he sleeps all day is depressed
9638900	9640900	I thought the quote you were referring to
9640900	9642900	is he thought that
9642900	9644900	sleeping with his mom's best friend
9644900	9646900	was a good way to get back at her
9646900	9648900	you told me that
9648900	9650900	that's another bullshit
9650900	9652900	you told me that
9652900	9654900	I read the book
9654900	9656900	that's in the book
9656900	9658900	no it's in the first part of the epilogue
9658900	9660900	I read the book
9660900	9662900	you're referring to this
9664900	9666900	well the book hasn't been
9666900	9668900	David we went through the different versions
9668900	9670900	you added just a few paragraphs
9670900	9672900	it's exactly the same copy I have
9672900	9674900	in the epilogue
9674900	9676900	I'm in the epilogue
9676900	9678900	in three pages and
9678900	9680900	one quote that you use for me
9680900	9682900	and that you know with what it's by me
9682900	9684900	is the negative one
9684900	9686900	I think it's all good
9686900	9688900	she's saying she feels like you
9688900	9690900	I understand what you're saying
9690900	9692900	you just represented her
9692900	9694900	my feelings please
9694900	9696900	you picked only negative things to further your agenda
9696900	9698900	of feigning a negative fortune
9698900	9700900	is what she's trying to do
9700900	9702900	I shared my feelings for you
9702900	9704900	and you didn't use them
9704900	9706900	I mean there's only one sentence
9706900	9708900	I think it is
9708900	9710900	clear when you're living with someone
9710900	9712900	and you're in a serious relationship with them
9712900	9714900	that you love them
9714900	9716900	no it's not
9716900	9718900	yes it is
9718900	9720900	and you don't show
9720900	9722900	I don't
9724900	9726900	so it's
9726900	9728900	you're saying the reader who can read between the lines
9728900	9730900	when the only quote I have
9730900	9732900	is a negative one
9732900	9734900	but she really loves him
9738900	9740900	I'll let the book speak for itself
9740900	9742900	I think that based on the feedback I've gotten
9742900	9744900	so far from people who don't know you
9744900	9746900	they think
9746900	9748900	frankly I haven't asked about you
9748900	9750900	but they think that you come off pretty well
9750900	9752900	you're complicated and you're flawed the way you are
9752900	9754900	but they think you come off pretty well
9754900	9756900	and if
9756900	9758900	you've actually read the book
9758900	9760900	that's being published as opposed to whatever you've looked at in the past
9760900	9762900	exact same book
9762900	9764900	well I don't know, I can't answer that
9766900	9768900	you don't even need to, it doesn't really matter to me
9768900	9770900	there's
9770900	9772900	the version of the book that is being published
9772900	9774900	which
9774900	9776900	all I can say is I stand by it
9776900	9778900	I'm proud of it
9778900	9780900	and I think it reflects you
9780900	9782900	you're a protagonist
9782900	9784900	along with your father
9784900	9786900	you're probably the main protagonists
9786900	9788900	and I'm proud of it
9788900	9790900	but it wouldn't have happened without you
9790900	9792900	I'm really really grateful
9792900	9794900	for
9794900	9796900	the work you provided for
9796900	9798900	to help you provide it
9798900	9800900	and
9800900	9802900	yeah and it honestly
9802900	9804900	it pains me to
9804900	9806900	this is not a pleasant afternoon for me
9806900	9808900	I was just not intended to be

10062900	10064900	okay
10064900	10066900	but
10066900	10068900	you know
10068900	10070900	I got a lot of clarification from this
10070900	10072900	I wanna talk about it tomorrow
10072900	10074900	cause now I know what to ask
10074900	10076900	cause it's too overwhelming to know
10076900	10078900	what to ask
10078900	10080900	a dispute because now I have to go to David
10080900	10082900	and I'll make the same deal with David
10082900	10084900	if he wants to watch over that footage
10084900	10086900	cause I mean they have the audio
10086900	10088900	but you know what I'm saying
10088900	10090900	I think it's only fair
10090900	10092900	because that's how I wanna question him too
10092900	10094900	two or three things that of my
10094900	10096900	you know of the way I'm looking at this story
10096900	10098900	and again what I think you need to
10098900	10100900	what I'm focused on
10100900	10102900	what I'm gonna keep asking you and him
10102900	10104900	is about these fraudulent pink ones
10104900	10106900	because
10106900	10108900	Tom Bowers
10108900	10110900	um
10110900	10112900	and particularly now that we know that he was evicted
10112900	10114900	and um
10114900	10116900	you know depressed and
10116900	10118900	helped him
10118900	10120900	I got him calling his report today
10120900	10122900	but he helped him
10122900	10124900	was he getting divorced?
10124900	10126900	did you guys say I had to call him?
10126900	10128900	yeah from Scott
10128900	10130900	did you get it?
10130900	10132900	no I didn't see it but I saw you tweeted
10132900	10134900	did it have anything surprising?
10134900	10136900	I'll tell you tomorrow on the camera
10136900	10138900	okay
10138900	10140900	yeah
10140900	10142900	yeah so you
10142900	10144900	I mean actually I think this was necessary
10144900	10146900	it was
10146900	10148900	it was and that's the thing
10148900	10150900	if it wasn't recorded by them
10150900	10152900	and I understand
10152900	10154900	that you didn't record it
10154900	10156900	and that's that you know it's not
10156900	10158900	we do need to like I need to look at that with you
10158900	10160900	because I don't I would have not caught
10160900	10162900	I wouldn't be able to describe
10162900	10164900	the things that I need to
10164900	10166900	ask questions about because there's such
10166900	10168900	is there something that I don't understand?
10168900	10170900	no
10170900	10172900	not at all
10172900	10174900	okay
10174900	10176900	I'm just gonna go home
10176900	10178900	there's not a footage of you and David
10178900	10180900	chatting in the cafe
10180900	10182900	I wish
10182900	10184900	I thought the camera would follow him out
10184900	10186900	I wish
10186900	10188900	no I told him to stay on here
10188900	10190900	if I follow them out like I'm kind of creepy
10190900	10192900	you know I'm already kind of creepy being here
10192900	10194900	obviously
10194900	10196900	one saying when David showing up
10196900	10198900	I was a little creepy you know I'm like
10198900	10200900	I told him
10200900	10202900	I told him I'd leave
10202900	10204900	you were talking documentary
10204900	10206900	well look
10206900	10208900	you know the good thing
10208900	10210900	the case of that is like
10210900	10212900	I could have called I had three choices
10212900	10214900	I could have called David and went up and said
10214900	10216900	hey I'm doing this doc and Val
10216900	10218900	Val doesn't want me to tell you about it
10218900	10220900	and then I wouldn't have anything to shoot because you tell me to fuck off
10220900	10222900	I could have
10222900	10224900	you know I asked you
10224900	10226900	you're not gonna tell him and
10226900	10228900	the third way is when he comes like
10228900	10230900	you know
10230900	10232900	call his bluff I guess
10232900	10234900	he didn't even have to
10234900	10236900	he wanted to mic up
10236900	10238900	so I'm glad that it worked out that way
10238900	10240900	well I mean
10240900	10242900	he wants it on record obviously
10242900	10244900	we also did not
10244900	10246900	it was going to happen
10246900	10248900	he thought he could win
10248900	10250900	he had no idea we'd get
10250900	10252900	buried
10252900	10254900	David's ego there is very arrogant
10254900	10256900	he thought he could win
10256900	10258900	of course
10258900	10260900	he thinks he's in the right
10260900	10262900	he thinks he's a trap
10262900	10264900	he doesn't think there's a trap
10264900	10266900	he's a trap
10266900	10268900	well I mean I didn't want it to be a trap
10268900	10270900	he could say get the fuck out of here
10270900	10272900	I think it's interesting I don't think it
10272900	10274900	I think what comes out of this is
10274900	10276900	you know he'll sell maybe
10276900	10278900	a couple more books
10278900	10280900	you have your story told
10280900	10282900	and you know
10282900	10284900	how can anyone be all that upset about it
10284900	10286900	either way everyone gets a little bit more of what they want
10286900	10288900	hopefully though
10288900	10290900	there are some of these loan documents
10290900	10292900	and there's a whole different
10292900	10294900	story
10294900	10296900	that's kind of what is needed
10296900	10298900	to happen at real time
