{"text": " He shows you the tactics of what David tries to do, but he doesn't have the patience to do, because he picks topics that take four years to cover, and that's just, you're gonna fuck up, okay? Yeah, yeah. Unless you're like, you know, like Psy Hirsch, or something like that, right? Psy Hirsch, he's not in that job. Oh, he's great, you see? You have to have such discipline. Oh, he doesn't have that discipline. Okay. Oh, you're saying you have that discipline? No, I'm saying Psy Hirsch has that discipline. To do a four-year story of this magnitude, right? Okay. He'll never waver. So, David, thanks for this, I waited until 9 a.m. Tuesday, so the second thing. David, thanks again for letting us film your interview with Valon Company. Hats off to you for figuring so much of this out and framing a deeply human narrative around it. I'm very much looking forward to, I'm basically saying I can play the Times game, too. Right, right. Fucking, you know, Page Boy. Like, I am very much looking forward to fully digging the book. I want to recognize you. Oh, to fully digging the book. Oh, okay. I want to reiterate that I'll be, oh, I almost, I almost, when he was asking where the page was, I was trying to find it. And I was going to be like, hey, it's game 156. I thought I heard you say, you almost, I think you did say that. No, I didn't. I think I thought I heard you say that. I thought you didn't say it. Someone, like, downstairs, you were saying, hey, who's got a copy? I was like, yeah. Then I shut up, yeah. You didn't hear that. I want to reiterate that I'll be fastidious in what makes the final cut and that will only be the facts. We will fact check, but this is much more of a portrait than an investigative piece. So checking those facts shouldn't be overly burdensome for anyone involved, as we won't be looking to break anything new, which is unless something new breaks, or focus on any areas of dispute other than what we get on camera. Your relationship with Val is one of many we explore with this piece. We will continue to challenge him on his version of events and his actions. I'll see you in a few hours. But I also wanted to check to see if you're still open to a solo interview following the daily taping. We could do it immediately afterward, or later this afternoon's last evening. We can work around your schedule. All my best, Rocco. Now, remember, he writes me back. Let's see. Within... One minute? No, not one minute. Within 15, within 14 minutes. Very fast. Thanks, Rocco. I appreciate your note. I'm happy to sit for an interview, but let's see how and how long things go today. It might be more sense to do it back in New York. I also should check with NYTPR people. Val made some pretty damaging allegations about me on camera yesterday. He said that I had told a deseret that I would basically pay off Val. He's only concerned with his business. Pay off Val so that I could get a solo interview. Right. His business. And he said that two of my sources, Tom Hayes and Tamiq Fad and both have expressed displeasure with how I've handled their stories and relationships. Nothing about this is the story writing of me. The thing about their stories. I checked with all three of them. They did not, having said this to Val. In the cases of Tom and Tami, they did not, having ever spoken to Val. I'm attaching screenshots of their denial so you can see for yourself. I'm not planning to raise this with Val today because I don't want to escalate things unnecessarily. But I hope you will treat this as a clear warning that Val not only is seeking revenge against me. That's his word. But he is spreading false information. Please tread carefully. If you are considering Arion and Val's allegations, please let me know. And I can give you contact in for Tami, Tami, Tom, and Odessa. But then he sends me these texts, right? And one of them he asks for permission. One of them he asks. What do you mean? One of them he says. And I share this with the producer. Oh, you see it. To whom? Oh, he sees the screenshots. Which is interesting. Yeah, this is not kosher. This is actually wire fraud. No, I understand. Pretty sure it is. Because he's two-party consent. Yes! He's sharing screenshots of other people. That's right. And then I said to him, you're in two-party consent state. You said that? Yeah. And he goes, you remember that California is a two-party... And then later on he goes, oh yeah, because California is a two-party consent state. Like, I'm basically telling him. No one's ever done it. No one's ever challenged. Like you said, no one really comes after you just with a will. But in the times, parlance, if you make a reporter look like a fucking idiot, they're sending you. But he thinks because I'm a reporter. But then he goes and says to show it to you. The dude who's fucking leaking on. Right, right, right. Okay? So that's just chuckle head city. That's funny. So Isha's... That's what you were doing with that day when you came and showed us, yeah. You get it? Yeah. That's when you said I've got some news. Yeah, yeah. And I didn't want to do what he told me to do, right? Because then I'm just as... He was trying to do two things. He was trying to... He didn't know what I was going to say the next day. He thought I was like on your side or whatever the fuck. He thought you were my crew. He kept seeing this in the text. And the first thing I say in the microphone. I'm not Val's crew. I want to make it really clear. Daily show, I'm not Val's crew, right? Yeah, I remember. I heard that. So if he fucking says that on the daily, I'm going to call up their almsbudsman and I'm going to fucking ream his ass. Val's crew. I'll shut up with his own film crew. I'm going to call him up. I'm going to say, well, we'll talk to him. I said, guess what? You got 24 hours or I'm leaking some video that makes him look fucking horrible. Which video? The fucking M-[Redacted] or something. Oh, leaking. Like a 20 second clip that makes him look... Or when he leaves, right? I don't mean come on. And then I'm going to say... You're leaving good, leaving good. I'm going to say, what do you want? I'm going to say I want a letter to the editor that I get to write her a column about this fucking experience and then we'll really... Oh man, I wanted to do that too about my experience with him. I think they should have. How could you do that? How could you tell him to go about doing it? Who did he talk to? He fucking twist their arm to a pop set of sockets. That's the only way to do it. Because you said something. You're right. But it would be better if I did it because I think it's fair. And you need to write your own book. We've already talked about that. I don't know how to beat that horse. So I'm saying, you see what I did. Wait, who did you get permission from? He got permission from, that's a good question. Because whoever you got permission from, he's actually scared of. The rest of them, he's not scared of. He's not scared of Dessa. Because remember, Dessa was the only one that wasn't on signal. Or maybe, wait, wait. You're going to care less about Dessa. Wait, and he text her at 7.52 a.m. That morning. That morning, it must have been. And I don't have the time. Why would he text her that early knowing she would get back? He's sending me signal? No, no. He must know that she was, because she's in Saudi Arabia. So he knows that. Why else would he do that 7 fucking 30 in the morning? Jesus. She'll cut you out of this quicker than you can fucking say. The shopping arrangement was to tie you up while he went and got his own. Wait, what? Yeah. It works. Shopping arrangement is worthless. So time me up while he goes and gets his own thing. With who? I don't think he's gotten it yet. No, with Adessa. Because that means Adessa is complicit. No, Adessa can't do both, I don't think. No, but she wanted to time me up. No, because she could do work with David. David. But she, they spoke with her. They spoke with David behind my back to get their own deal. That's what I'm saying. To have their own deal with David. With the agent. With the agent, right? So the agent's the cutout, right? No, with the agent. No, with the agent. The agent is the cutout. Oh, the cutout. Who then allows to have her hands clean, right? But that's part of the course in Hollywood. You can't complain about that. The reporters you can complain about. But that's just, you gotta be a shark. And David's not a shark. He's a squid. Like, you know, I see exactly what they're doing. It's amateur hour. And the agents are gonna walk away with a bunch of money. That's who's gonna win. Not them. Because remember we had the problem with the agents from CAA? Remember we had the agents from WMA or WM, whatever? The agents from CAA and WME. Yeah, go ahead. They are as good. They are like smart FBI agents. Right. With an unlimited bank account. Who can do whatever the fuck they want. Right. Stay away from agents. Remember the guy? Yeah, no, you're right. But they said, we don't want to work with Val because apparently there's some sort of vendetta at Valhouse with Andrew Durecky. I don't want to be in the middle of it. Is that true, though? Do you have a vendetta with him? No, no. You just kind of falling out with him, right? No, I wanted to get back in with him. So I said, get Andrew a copy of this. Put it on his desk. I want Andrew to do this. Put it on his desk. Once he sees that it's a packed, complete copy. Yeah, but is he capable? Andrew? Oh, he's very capable. Okay. It just takes forever. That's my problem with that shit. It takes way too long. But we don't want to live in that world anymore. I know, I know. We did when the Jinx came out. Yeah. Is it slow? It's slow. What the fuck happened here? Where? Data needs. I don't know what that means. Wait, so who got permission? Tom. I think it was Tom. Tom. Tom. I'll check, but I'm almost positive. But as you said, he only cared about him. And Tom gave him shit. Yeah, he did. Tom gave him shit. I wish I could see the numbers in these. But he said to give them to me. Yeah. But the problem is, if I give them to you, again, it puts me, he's trying to trap me into a situation where I do something like that, or he can discredit me. Well, you decide camera. What? You showed it to me. I showed it to you. On camera? Yeah, yeah. But if I were to go and get the numbers, that he wouldn't give you, if I went and got the numbers from him. What numbers? He gets up for you. Oh, they're phone numbers. Yeah. And then I gave them to you. Oh, yeah, yeah. And he's held them off from you for so long, he's going to say, well, Rocco leaked it. And that way, the circle's complete. You know who really wanted the numbers? FBI. They called me and asked me for... Why can't they get the fucking numbers? You kidding me? I don't get that. They asked me for Tammy's number. Well, no wonder the Trump's taking the shit on the FBI. They're fucking stupid. They can't find a number? I found Tammy's in the fucking number. I don't know if it's right. I've been calling her. They wanted, I guess they wanted an easy route. Number? They wanted an easy route. They said, can you get me Tammy's number? They wanted to see if you knew their numbers. No, they said, I said, I don't know the numbers. I said, but David obviously knows, as you know. So I will ask David. Do you see if you knew the numbers? No. I said, no, no, no. Just listen. Let me finish. Sorry. I said, I will ask David. I said, David, I kind of need the number for Tammy. He said, why? Well, you told him why. No, I didn't. I never told him why. No, I didn't. I said, well, look, there's this whole thing, blah, blah, blah, blah. And you know, I got a whistleblower friend at Deutsche Bank and he's interested in knowing if you can cross-reference some of his data with the data of Tammy's. He goes, well, you know, okay, if I can't give you her number, but you know what? I can give you the lawyer's number. Here's the lawyer's number. That's it. So I said, I went back to the FBI. I said, FBI, I'm sorry, this is the best I could do. And to be fair to David or anybody, you can't operate as an extension of law enforcement. That's the worst thing a journalist could ever do, because you'll never gain your credibility back. Right. And that's what it is. And in that instance, that's what it is. No, but you got worse. What happened was, because I didn't even get the number, one of the FBI agents called up, called up the lawyer, sorry, called up the David Enrich directly. How did they get the number from me and said, hey, we would like Tammy's number. And then everyone in the fucking New York Times flipped out, flipped the fuck out. And then that's why they included the FBI in the story. So the FBI called us looking for him. And then they said, basically, he called the, the FBI ended up calling the lawyer. David calls me and says, oh my God, you never even guess what just happened. It's the craziest thing in the world. You know that guy that the FBI you're working with? He just called me. I'm like, no. It was funny. I couldn't believe it. When you told the story tomorrow, that's what you told me. No, and then, no, but that's because then the next day, the FBI, I called them and was like, dude, what are you doing, you guys? I could have gotten your number just like waited around a little longer. Why did you call David? Because now you're going to be in the story and I'm in the story, right? Because I'm the one with the connection here. And the guy's about, he apologized, but I'm so sorry. We fucked up. No, it's funny, it really is. He said, I'm so sorry. Fuck that. We shouldn't have done that. We shouldn't have done that. We should have just let you do it. I'm so sorry. I just couldn't wait any longer. I wanted to try and get it myself. Why the fuck is the FBI so interested in these people? In this story, in this particular? They're not. They're interested in the Starz reports. And that's when you... Because David had no documentation. That's why I kept bringing that shit up. He did have documentation. No, he didn't. He has nothing. He doesn't. What is he doing? He's calling down. He's just the fucking word of his word and Tammy's word. And they think that's enough to have a story. It is for a book, unfortunately. What? It's for a book. It is enough to sell the book. No, but it was the article that... No, you're right, you're right. Read the article with Tammy. There's nothing. You're right. No one saw it. No one has it. Tammy supposedly saw it. That's why they questioned if she was credible or not. Yes. Do you think she's credible? Yes, she's credible. I think she's credible, too. But I think David is when it's not credible. He's the one that's writing this up in his spin without any documentation or anything. Because he got so deep in that there was no way out. Yeah, when he got all the way down there, he was really excited and he came up back with nothing. No reports. Long paper work. Long paper work. David, David, he's got it. He's got something. It's fraudulent. I'm going to press him on it. Press him? Fucking hard. I'm going to say, we're talking about this a lot. We're talking about this a lot. Because it's all I care about. That's where dispute, when I put the pen in it, that's exactly where dispute is. And all the rest of the shit's noise. Where are the fucking lenders? I'm trying to get them in. I know. I don't think we're going to get them, right? I'm going to try. But if they're fraudulent, it's just as important and weird as if they're real, right? But we don't know if it's really fraudulent because only Deutsche Bank has said they're fraudulent. Only Deutsche Bank has said that. That's what I'm saying. But they could be fraudulent because the Russians signed off-room with dead money that isn't real money and not real fucking lenders because they don't have the right to lend through Deutsche Bank. I'm going to bring up a good point, but what is fraudulent to them? What is they saying is fraudulent? Because in my head, fraudulent, in everyone's head means, oh, someone faked the document. Well, that's ordinary. That's not fraudulent. Well, that's- Fraudulent would be the Russians signed off on them and weren't officers in the company. Oh, that's interesting too. Just fucking recording everything, huh? That's interesting too. Yeah, that's just the thing right there. That shit. I have it set. When are you going to turn on me? I'm going to turn on you. I just don't want to make sure you don't turn on me. Dude, I don't- You're a journalist. Look at my history. But you're still a journalist. Understood. And I haven't had very good luck with journalists. I see that. But I also think- Marie, Marie. I'm trying to give you- have you ever had a journalist tell you that I think you're just approaching- you're trusting them too much? Have you ever had a journalist tell you that? No, I did. No, no. No, so that should tell you something. But you're an ex-journalist. That's a good thing. I'm not an ex-journalist. Dude, I took a chance with you. Don't worry. Well, you did take a chance. If I thought you were- I wouldn't have had you. You wouldn't be here talking with me. What I'm saying is someone gets your shit and like, you know, like, fucks me. No, but okay. Oh, no, no, I wasn't gonna get my shit. I don't think I've said anything. Anything I've said right now, I would say on a daily show. Dude, I didn't- I didn't- I actually wasn't supposed to. I wasn't supposed to record. I actually accidentally did in it. But now, oh, hey, could think maybe you could read those texts for us? Yeah. I mean, not like- I'm not recording or anything. No, we read them on camera. I don't care if you're recording. It's very easy. Yeah, just for ourselves. Because you won't give us the other things. So I'm gonna- I'm gonna give you shit. I really want to listen to day one of the fucking date. This is my- It's my bounty. I took a risk, too. You know, I didn't know if that guy was gonna walk out or like, you know, I spent a bunch of money on bullshit. I know, I know. You didn't. Yeah, but you- We're all taking it. We have to. We're trusting each other. That's the way we have to do it. Yeah, and- And you're trust- I wasn't sure and I- No, and then I spoke to you on the phone and I was like, no, I think he's good. Yeah, you didn't. But first, I thought you were crazy. I was like, I think he's crazy. I am crazy. No, I thought, you know, he thought you're like a madman, up the streets. Because you know what I thought you were? I thought you were stalking me since 2014, actually. Why? Because I thought, you know what, this sounds a lot like the guy who said he was from Vice in 2014 during the Sony hack. He said, come down to LA and hide in my basement. Dude, I- Listen to me. There was a guy- I didn't tell you this yet. I was in the room- It was you. I was in the room with Seth Rogen. Yeah. And his partner, Evan. Yeah. At the fucking lot. Yeah. When the shit went down, I got the only interview with Seth and Franco and all the people. That's good. And it's online. Yeah. And then they pull the movie. And I get a call from Seth and he's like, dude, they're fucking canceling the movie. Because I told him they're gonna cancel this fucking movie. He's like, how do they do that? I said, I don't know. But then I'm driving and I see them taking the poster down. I'm like, this is like Nazi Germany. What the fuck is going on? Yeah. Go over to the fucking thing. They're smoking tons of weed. And I'm like, guys, first thing's first. I like, I like marijuana too, but you need to put that bong down because this is some fucked up shit. Right? Yeah. And they got on the phone with Michael Linden and listened to it all. Michael Linden. And they fucking. I sat next to him at the dead Andy Drecky's screening of the Jinx. I sat right next to him. Didn't know who he was. That day I was looking through his inbox and posting it all online. Anyway, I'll read you these texts and then I gotta go. No, okay. Come on. I'll do it. So what was the end of your story? So, you remember the interviews based on Vice's shit, right? Wait, on Vice's shit? We went to North Korea, right? Oh, was that really? Yeah, and they called me up like two years before the movie came out and they said, can you hook us up with the guys that went to North Korea? We'll pay them. We need research. Okay. Franco was writing for me at the time. Okay. Right? So, man, that really ended weird. Franco now does AA speeches all over Los Angeles. Does it really? That's his redemption? I can email him right now or text him and he'll fucking call me. He'll fuck to anybody. Tell me who's the sponsor. Who won't talk to me now is Seth, though. I didn't do anything wrong to him. They just said... Why? Because they basically Hollywood said, we can't have rock'n'roll in this shit anymore. Why? Why did you fuck with them? Well, because Vice was a golden ticket for a lot of people. Why? I don't know. I'm still not asking that question. Why anyone thought that? Yeah. Now it's all in the Wall Street Journal, so I don't have to convince anyone. Read this so I can tune this out. Here's the Tammy text. Thank you, David. Just got your book. Can't wait to read it. Congratulations. And that looks like it was from a few days ago. It doesn't say the date. Today, 5.33 p.m. So that would be the first day of the interview following the interview, right? Actually, the interview again. I hope you like it. This is David. Just so you know, I'm in LA right now with Val Brochement, who is filming a documentary. She isn't true. Told me it wasn't true. Rocco Castoro is filming a documentary. Rocco doesn't want to be a credit. I don't want the credit. He's so Hollywood. I do want the credit. And, you know, it's also a discredit. The whole discredits it if you're shooting a documentary on yourself. Hey, hey. A documentary on themselves? What are you, a fucking rapper? Yeah, I mean, come on, dude. It's true. I hope you like it. Just so you know, I'm in LA right now with Val Brochement, who is filming a documentary set on a camera that you're really unhappy with me and how I treated you. I don't know if you talked to him or told him that. But if you do feel that way, I'm so sorry to hear it. As I told Val, I have the utmost respect for you and everything you've done. And I have tried hard to treat you well. And I've done anything wrong. I sincerely apologize. Which, let's be clear. You didn't say that. No. The reporter said that. And I clearly said, I did not speak to Tammy. Who is Val? Question mark, exclamation mark, question mark, question mark. I do not know this person in question mark. And then like the, ooh, like the face, the emojis, right? Tammy. And then David says, he's the son of the DB executive committed suicide in 2014. She says, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Question mark, question mark. Okay. Like almost at the point where I'm like, does she know Val? I do not see the email. That was my first I was like, does she know Val? But no, she's just, that's how she talks. I didn't send emails there. She doesn't remember. Okay. It's fine. He might have been lying. Don't worry. Don't worry. I do not know him and I have never had a conversation with him. Period. I believe you 100%. Don't worry. It's unbelievable. People are weird. Can you please call me? We have the footage. You didn't say it. He said a lot of shit, but you didn't say that. Hey, Tom. This is Tom Hayes. So he suspects that you just don't remember what just happened and you don't have video cameras. No, he's drunk or some shit. No, but sending it to you. He wasn't planning on sending these to me. I forced him to do it when I sent him that email in the morning. Oh really? He panicked. Why? Yeah, why? Think about it. He was in the WALT in here the next day and I don't know if he was either, he probably wasn't going to bring these up because it would escalate it, but this was his backstop. I was in. And I said, that's my motherfucker. Do you remember when he left? When he left, he said, he said, remember about tomorrow there's going to be a big announcement? Yeah, and he didn't make an announcement. Nothing happened. He said, Tammy was in. He wanted me to be his dildo. Yeah, to make the announcement for him. And I said, you're the dildo, bro. Sorry. Because he says, hey Tom, I was meeting today with Al Brochement and like this is, I have no problem. This is how I'm going to talk on my daily show. Yeah. You know, I'm just going to call journalists, dildos and stuff because they are, and this is ridiculous. Like, hey Tom, I was meeting today with Al Brochement who's involved in Deutsche Bank Sider and he told me, as we're being filmed for a documentary he's doing, once again, Rocco Castoro is doing, that you and Sarah were very unhappy with how I treated you in the book. I don't know if you've talked to Val or told him that, but this is how you feel. I am very sorry. Who is he? My mom was. This is Tom. I didn't realize you would use so much about her. That caused problems between mom and Sarah and this is, he went to jail, right? Yeah. 14 years. That caused problems between mom and Sarah, but they always hated each other. My honest view is that it was a bit hyperbolic and that Japanese Libor is not linked to retail products at all. I mean, this guy has really valid points. Certainly not credit cards and strident loans. I think you conflated USD and, is it Japanese Libor? I also failed to look properly at what triggered the investigation. It's low balling and what the rules actually weren't as is the case, but I can't expect you to read a book for the defense, which is interesting that he says that. You can't read a book for the defense. He's basically saying, you need to be salacious, I get it. You wrote it in the absence of all the fresh evidence. He's also saying he didn't help me. Yes. Well, he hedges that later. So he's fair at least. You wrote it in the absence of all the fresh evidence we now have in new witnesses. That's interesting because he wrote it without that. He could have included that. The book wasn't even out yet. That's true. He wrote it at a time when I was considered guilty by most in the book, at least caused a review of that narrative. That's where he's fair. I know that because of all the mail that was sent to me by complete strangers, which again is like, what mail, like the book's not out yet. So I guess what he's saying is mail that while David was doing his reporting, they mailed him saying, hey, I'm sorry, this happened to you and that's the only thing I can imagine. Sources and friends of his? I don't know yet who David was calling, right? That's the only thing I can think of. And Sarah Deffo wasn't happy with it. Maybe he heard from Andrew Verity, who's the FT reporter who you know. He contacted me. That's the guy. Holy shit. Andrew Verity. He contacted me on Twitter. He wants to talk to me. One more. I have, look, I have things for him. Well, that's the view. Maybe you should talk to him now. Fuck, yeah. Good thing you regret this thing. I did tell him that I thought the book was too light on the BOE and the treasury rule on this. I only discovered Mom Knew Tom Scholar. So much was only just discovered Mom Knew Tom Scholar. So much was hidden. So Sarah hates him. That's the one. That's why I said the wife. I said that on camera, the wife hates you. Yes, he did. I did. I said that positively. Bar the RBC section that you never spoke to me about. Their narrative was wrong. RBC section? So don't worry if you even worry. I have no idea. So you got something wrong. RBC section. It is. Risk, uh... Risk something. Strangely, I like you, David. Risk break up. This is the weirdest text I've ever read. Strangely. Strangely, I like you, David. But as you say in your book, this guy's actually fucking great. Sometimes friends aren't friends. And, you know, that's what Barrett was going off about. It's good. Friends. Because he learned the hard way, right? That's true. He's saying what you're saying. Yeah. Hopefully, in this occasion, I do get it. Wait, when did I say that? Well, that's what you said to me. You said David was your friend. Oh, I did. And you can't be friends. You can't be friends with journalists, Val. You can't. Yeah, you're right. You know what I mean? You can. I'll tell you this. You can. And the problem with David and me, for me, is this. He used you for sources on other stories, then you thought of him as a friend, which that is kosher in certain regards, where if you've used a source and you like that person and you want to be a human, you know, so I thought it was, I thought we were friends. So I called him a friend. I called him. It was the first story that he called me. He used you. No, he didn't say this. We were friends. And then all of a sudden, it became his best interest to not be friends with me and to use me instead. And then that's what happened. But you can never be friends with your sources. But see, and the difference is like, I can shoot a film about you. How do you not be friends if you're five years and talking to me? Oh, shit. You're a human, right? That's why you don't take five years to report something. You make a fucking documentary. That's why you do it. Like, I'm not joking. Like, I don't buy this bullshit that people are like, well, I'm a print journalist. Well, then you're fucking a dinosaur. Like, you have to do all of it. And it's really important because this proves it. This fucking, you know, regurgitation is better shit, right? So it's like, strangely, I like you, David, but as you say in your books, sometimes friends aren't friends. Hopefully in this occasion, I do get it. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm not sure if Sarah wants us to talk. To be honest, I'm confused. He said, thanks, Tom. For what? And he said, for your response. Oh, that's okay. And it looks like, it says today, so it looks like that was at five. That was right after the interview, so he was fucking furious about that shit. And then the next day he wrote and said, thanks, Tom. Oh, that's okay. He said, if it is okay, I tell the TV producer that you're not unhappy with how I've treated you. Otherwise, I'm concerned they're going to take valid his word that you aren't happy with me. What the fuck, my, he does not fit, there are cameras there, I don't have to take you at your word. Why is he texting? Why is he showing you this? I don't know. It's ridiculous. You think I expected to get this back 10 minutes after I fucking e-mail, but I knew if I waited the morning that whatever trap he had laid, I just ganged it. So weird. Or if he didn't, then it was fine. Yeah, I can't talk. It says, I was talking to the TV producer that you're not unhappy, now I'm a TV producer obviously. Otherwise, I'm concerned they're going to take valid his word that you aren't happy with me. Yeah, I can't talk to him, but isn't that guy someone, someone who's dad died? He said, yes. And then he, Tom says, the producer or Val, which he's like, I don't, I don't want to laugh at that. He's confused. But then he says, I'll level with you. But then David says, the producer, right? Yeah, I can't talk to him, but isn't that guy someone's who's dad died? Yes. Tom. The producer or Val question mark, I'll level with you. This is still Tom. The producer. Oh, and I would see what he's saying. He's saying, will you, can I, who, who should I tell? Right, right, right. Sorry, that's my mistake. You can show him this part of the chat, but then they talked about something else. This one was the only one not on, you don't remember, these are on signal. So a text screenshot is one thing. But if I'm texting on signal and I have it auto-delete and you do that, you better be fucking ready to rumble. From my perspective, if you better be ready to fucking rumble, I'll wait 10 years and I'm going to get you. I texted your stuff to Barrett. I don't give a shit. Barrett's fine. That's because I didn't introduce you to Barrett. It's like, here's this guy. I sent Barrett all my... I told him, I like him. He's a pretty good guy. He talks a lot. You know, but I think he knows what he's doing and he appears to be saying, honestly, I like him. Thank you. That's what my assessment of you. Thank you. I think Barrett realized that we know a lot of the same people. Once I told him that I was commissioned to write We Are Anonymous, which is Parmi Olson's book and he's in it, and how meta this was and that I wanted to commission him before he went to jail, but we just didn't get to that point. And I know different people, Del Cameron and Daily Dot people and all these people. And I have a deep understanding of anonymous. And we talked about how that morphed into Paul and my Paul right. I need to finish this and then maybe, you know, I just don't throw me into it because I don't want to like walk. I got thrown into some group to give a day that was like, cuck, what was it? It was like, no cucks allowed part two or something and I was like, what the fuck did someone put me in? It was like some fucking neo-nazi meme shit. And I'm like, dude, someone's trying to set me up or something and I just said, fuck all you Nazis. And I left the grid. Hi, I guess I hope you're doing well. I mean, this is again, you know, this is one for us to hear this. I hope you're doing well. I'm in LA recording. And this is 7 52 a.m. So that would be the next morning. He screenshot 9 24. Okay. So you got to remember that he screenshot this after I wrote him. Okay. You know what I'm saying? Because this was his big news. And then he said, oh, wait, I can use Rocco. Like he like, right? He thought he could be a step. All right. Look at this. And then he says at the end. Well, you're, I can't remember if he said your friend. He said our friends, our friends, our friends have some stuff to tell you in the master interview. I don't know if you caught that. I did not. Yeah, he says it to you. That's why I didn't tell you. So wait, wait, what? He says our friends or something. I'm not. It may not be correct. Something friends. It doesn't say your friends. I don't think the world will be real fucked up and I'm going to hit him on that. You know, I'm not going to hit him on it, but I'm going to complain. And be like, you know, David, if you talk about this again, you know that I'm doing this independently, right? Like, like I didn't know that you've known down for four fucking years. Like you are in five years. You are in that seat. I'm not in that seat. I got in and I got out and I got you on camera. I'm not your fucking friend. So don't make me your enemy. And, you know, I'm going to basically be like, how would you like it if I fucking said, Oh, Val's got a story is right. Val's got a story is right. He's got a New York Times reporter. He's writing it with a New York Times reporter. You wouldn't like it at all because you did everything within your power to make sure that no one could say that. So we know you wouldn't like it. And, you know, go to Mark Thompson and ask him about me. Ask him how dangerous a fucking am with the media. Like, you know, go ask him and then go ask him. Yeah. The pedophilia. He was good. Pedophilia. He covered up at the BBC that came out two weeks after he started at the Times. Anyway, hi, I hope you're doing well. I'm in LA recording a podcast interview with Val and he's filming a documentary. He said on camera yesterday that you told him that when you and I met in NYT at NYT. Yeah, that's like, you didn't say at NYT because you didn't know they were at NYT, right? No, they said outside in a cafe. Yeah, but you never brought up. He's bringing up that he's giving up the fact that she met him at a New York Times. He got confused though. He's not doing that on purpose. No, but exactly he's giving up something. I told that if I got a film deal that didn't include Val, it would be fine because I would just throw lots of money at Val and he would be pacified. Is that true that you said that to Val? And this seems a bit... Set up. Yeah. I'm not going to say that. Hello. But... Very much. I'm going to say this in the text. Right. Screenshot it, right? Because this isn't the morning. Right. I know. Okay. I told you I got a film deal that didn't include Val would be fine because I would just throw lots of money at Val and he would be pacified. Is that true that she said that to Val? I have no recollection of ever having said anything like that to you or anyone else. That was David. Odessa says, I never said that. No, I would have never said that. I don't remember talking to you about that. Or Val. Dot, dot, dot. That's it. You got a problem with this Odessa woman. I don't know who she is. I'd love to stick a fucking camera in her face. She texted me just when we walked in the door. Well, don't do it now. Because. Do it tomorrow. Make sure it's there. Oh, okay. I've got. Okay. We are going to go today. 15th, February 15th. What's that? I don't know. We're heard from him. Who's that? David. No. I will call him Monday. What we're doing is... You're going to call him tomorrow? Monday. It's Sunday. I don't know if it's Sunday. You're going to call him tomorrow. Do you want a camera? Oh. If you want to do that, we can do that. Yeah. And I probably... I got that reversed. Look, I was saying if you want to ask one camera. Oh. If you want to ask one camera. To call him? And ask him for the reports. After we talk to someone. I think they could... I don't know. It's up to you. Otherwise, you know, I do want to talk to some other people. Okay. And if I have to go to the New York Times to interview him. In Andrew. That's when I'll ask. Okay. So, my own documents are the key to all of this. Fragrant loan documents in my point of view. And I'm talking about in terms of what I'm covering. But I also think in the larger story. So, the only way I can manage to do this in terms of the way I can understand it. Because I don't understand why David walked out. There's multiple reasons why I could have walked out. We'll go over it with you. So, we're going to go over it. And I normally wouldn't do this, but I'm going to do that. Because I don't know what transpired. I need context. And I'm going to ask David. For the same context. Okay. And I'll go over it with him too. If he needs to. But he has a recording. So, I don't take it. Thank you. That's correct. The question. So, did I miss you saying you're going to go to New York to interview him? If I have to. I mean, he said, you know, I asked if I could interview him. He said he would. But maybe it would be best if we do it back in the New York Times building. With the PR team there. Or at least maybe he didn't say with PR team that he's going to check with the PR team. I actually would like the PR team there. Yeah? Yeah. I don't really have like 10 questions. Right. I need you to help me decipher some of this. Because the relationship between you and David and what they're going to edit out most likely. Because it doesn't make sense without context. I need context on. So, that's to me why this is a, you know. Another thing. You have your own issues in the New York Times. No, I don't. Really? No. I think until there's evidence that, no, I said other women had issues with the reporting that she did. A lot of women. I don't know. I'm confused. I'm confused. Yeah. That's separate from this. And that's like, I'm not going to bring that up there. No, of course not. I'm just. I'm just. I mean, like every New York Times every day, like I think most people do. They won't ban you. That's what you're saying. They're not going to ban you from venturing. I don't mean if they do. I hope they do. I hope somebody bans me. Everything like, you know, like why not? But so yeah, we're going to review this because I need you to help me decipher. Okay. What went down by David left some things on the first day, which I don't think they're going to air much of. They pretty much said that. Did they? Oh, they said like they said M-[Redacted]e being there was an issue. Maybe that's the makeup. I don't know. Nobody is going to. That's that's that's just talk. Nobody knows yet. Nobody knows but when are they supposed to air? I don't know. I don't know. This is March 18th or a little more possibly, but that's what gets the problems in March 18th. He said the guests off the top said you heard the conversation. That means there must be another story coming out about fc. We don't know because you can't say that for sure. But you said that he would tell the story of NFC from the book. So there's a couple possibilities. Okay, okay, okay. Is that the way he presented the thing to us, he said, it will start with David and Barbados. David and Barbados? Who started with David? Who started with David and Barbados? That's what Eric said to us on the phone. Eric, who? The producer. Oh, what? No, and the guy, what's his name? The fucking guy from the dating. Why would he be in Barbados? No, it's not Barbados. The name of the guy that is the David podcast... Oh, Barbaro. Barbaro. Well, the arm is here. Well, I... You're thinking, oh my god, John McAfee. I'm thinking... No, I'm not thinking John McAfee. I'm thinking Barbados. That's another thing. That he will introduce that. Yes, yes. But we don't know for sure. We can say a lot of shit. You know what I said David wasn't coming here to talk about? David. Yeah. And then he said a lot of bullshit. How many did he say? He wants two videos. Listen, nobody knows until the footage is put together. And you have to understand, like, here's my thing. It's like, I want to shoot you listening to whatever they put together for the daily. So whenever that happens, I got to send Ellington over here just to shoot that. You know what I'm saying? We can report it. We can do it here, Kevin. Yeah, but no, I need to have it the same. Like, I'm trying to up the standard for this kind of shit, you know? And another thing I thought as I got to tonight was cancelled is that if we do the podcast with Scott, you should be there. Well, I wanted to film it, but I just had a miscommunication on the phone with you. I really thought that you guys didn't want us to... I think we wanted a break, which I totally... I mean, the crew needed a break, too. We didn't need a break. That's my miscommunication. Then I totally... If I would have... I had him booked. I'd rather than be here right now, but it's fine. It's actually worked out. It worked out. It worked out. And then while we're... I have some questions, so I'm going to stop this when I do. And that's why we're doing this, because I don't understand some of this stuff. Okay. But... Because I need context for your and David's relationship. Okay? Now, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me pause it. Oh, wait. There's even going to be a volume through this. You look fantastic, though. I look like an idiot. Come on. Here you go. I got it. I got it. You look so hot. I'm going to go with 1964 Southern... No, you do. That's why you look cool. You look so hot. I'm just outside. You guys should be handing out flyers in Baptist Southern Louisiana. What the fuck? That's kind of fun. Is there no volume? Because this is going through this now. 1964. I'm just telling you, I'm good at this. Thank you. What? That's all you need to say. Thank you. You said pretty sweet. Yes, sir. No, I don't. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Stupid. It's not working. Oh, wait. I mean, him next to David... I don't think it's going to work through the sound, maybe. I think I have to put it through here. You can't air drop the sound out. Oh, can I air drop it through there? Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, there you go. Yeah, I used that. I built a mirror in Samsung. I think I made it in Samsung. Oh, that'll do it, too. Well, I had it on that. I had it on a mirror. Oh, you did? Oh, maybe it's the other one. The only worst case scenario which I'm afraid of is that they won't play it. Yeah, exactly. Do you think that's possible? I think it's possible. What's the code for Apple TV? I'm sorry. It should show up on your phone somewhere. Let me see. I'm just going to hit... Apple TV code. I have to bring up the app, right? I don't know. Because I think it's going to play the sound through the TV. No, you don't need... That's because you're going through the Apple TV. No, I've just tried all the different outputs for sound. Yeah. For some reason, I don't think the HDMI is carrying it. Or try Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Bikki TV. Yeah. That's the Apple TV. Can I try the other... Let's just play it through here. Can I play? Here. The whole point is the sound. I want to hear how we did the sound. Yeah, but... I don't have the sound. I don't have the audio. This is not Eric's audio. This is from the onboard mic on the camera. Gotcha. That's terrible. Oh, we just plugged the speakers in there. Yeah, yeah. If you have an output, yeah. That works. Give me the... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, shit. Do you have that... That kind of plug? Mm-hmm. Good. Bill Maher. I miss Bill Maher. I love Bill Maher. I've got him recently. He did? What'd he do? Just like... What'd he say? What the fuck? What did he say? He didn't challenge Ben on the show the last time he was on. Sometimes it's just too high. Bill Maher? Bill Maher. Is it who the guy is? Headphone. Sometimes it's too high as well. Is it 10? This isn't working. Oh, I need this. I need a headphone. Here, I got it. I have it, I have it. I think that's the... No, I got it. That's your aunt. No, no, no. Okay. They should have plugged in. They might not be plugged in. Is it not plugged in? Yeah, here we go. I think they have to be powered. Yeah, it's not plugged in. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Bill Maher always the same people coming on. I know. So it's like, okay. But, you know, I love Bill Maher. You can't... I want him to go on Bill Maher. Yeah, what's his name? He'll get us on the show. Okay, and I have your word. You're not going to leak audio. This is for reviewing with me. Because I know you're recording. Okay. And I'm taking that chance. But I am... On the type almost, on my son's... And I... Wait, just can you stop bouncing stuff on your son's life? That's ridiculous. On my life. Thank you. Fair enough. Because I mean, no one hurts you guys if you do it. Okay. Ready? Please. Marie, Marie, can you just stop and eat? I am, I am. Good grief. Both of you. Gosh. At least you make me laugh. You guys are hilarious. All right. Was it funny? Yeah. It's not funny. I'm just going to have a look at the court record. Go ahead. There you go. There you go. Damn, it's live, Sarah. Ah. Sounds like you're plugging in your guitar, Val. Yeah. It does actually. By the way, those amps, they're good. Yeah. Apologize? That's right. Work it out. Sometimes apologies went down. I mean, let's put this in context. You... He just apologized to you. And I think we have that, but it's on a different card. Okay. Well, I want to see that. Well, we have it. Literally, he says you apologize, and we switched. Like, it has two cards in it, and it switches over. And I couldn't find... Like, I would have to scrub through all the shit to do that, and, like, it would have taken me another hour. Like, it's just because it's at the very end, right before the end, and I didn't know where it was. Damage is done. There's irrevocable damage. It's really difficult to... It's really difficult to just sit there and say, Oh, what a lovely apology. Thank you. Listen to me for it. But no, when lives are ruined, because what David did was... It's called a character assassination. He went on, and he tried to assassinate him. He tried to murder him. Now, I have been ruminating on as to why for many, many a day. And I came up with a few ideas. The one being the one I think I already brought up was to discredit me so that you can take this book and say, I did all this to myself. You know, and if I ever jump up and say, Hey, that's not true. I did this. And then you can just, oh, that's just drug, that's just drug addict Val. Don't listen to him. He's the credit card-thieving guy that's out for, that would sell his own fucking father for a movie deal. Oh, you fucker. I just can't believe you went that low. I still can't, I've never really bothered you. Incincidentally... But I don't let me go on a tangent. I'm sorry. No, I'm cutting you. No. Incincidentally enough. No. Because it's annoying. I wasn't really pissed off. No, it was good. You went through my head. You were really pissed. I had the thought. I had the thought. Oh, please, both of you are joining me crazy. You're talkers. The two of you together. Oh, and you're not a fucking talker? You're just pissed because you can't, you know, talk over brother-in-law. There's a question. So I say something. I went to the jump sign. Please, look at me. It's a big one. It's a stereo now. Okay. I was so angry. I had the thought that you're standing up and punching me in the face. No. I was thinking about that. No. And then I thought that was a bad idea, like you're saying, obviously. Because it was on camera. I was that angry. Like, I don't even fight. I don't even fight in the light. And you know what it is. So I was 23. Did you fail? I felt it. No. Nobody wants to work with you. Nobody does, right? No. I get to... When I read you and David, and I remember you saying the article would change your life. Oh, God. How many times did you say that? Oh, God. The article, your life's going to change. Oh, make me a star. You're going to make me a star. I remember that... Yes, you did say that. That was funny. Thank you. And then... Marie, what happened to all your friends? I've been humiliated at school. I mean, people don't want to... You know, I was mad. They don't want to come here. Is that true, Marla? I'm really sorry to hear that. He said that. Yeah. We've had a... You don't deserve any of this, Marla. Yeah, but that has nothing to do with the whole conversation. Yeah, but... It does, Marla. Yeah, it does, but... I do. And I'll tell you what. If someone had done something that I felt harmed one of my kids, the reaction I would have would be vicious and angry, and I would do anything that would protect my kids. So, if what you're saying is true, but has affected his life, I would have a very horrible reaction to it. Well, that's why I'm in a horrible reaction here. No, I get that. I hear you. Okay, you have a horrible reaction. I don't feel any sincerity, but... Well, part of it... Can I just say, Marie, it's a little rich to say, I'm not showing enough feeling when you blindside me by having a camera crew here to record it. I'm being very careful about the facial expressions I use, being very cognizant of the fact that there's a camera recording this. So, you see what happens here? So, it's really you. It's Huey Hayes. And, Roko, I must tell you, there's something very important. Three days after the article was published, I called his wife, and I told her all four consequences in my son's life, in Marla's life and my life. And she says, oh, really? He's in a valve like that. I said, do you know since that article? And you're referring to the... To the article and drug addiction and mischaracterization. I said, good question. Had your husband yelled at you at the... Or yelled at Val? That was later. That was later. PTA, okay. I thought that maybe had happened already too. No, that was... You're going to teach your conference. Can you imagine? And so that he pretends to be surprised is even more alive. He's known that since October. And there's not nothing. Nothing, nothing. Even I called his wife because he didn't know my text. He would not answer my text. Nothing. I said, David, what you've done is affecting my son. You are a father. Why have you done this? Do you know that I'm... Val is not alone in the fucking desert. You know? In the vacuum inside it, right? Yeah. But he... He knows. So this is also important to put this... I don't know, somehow we can explain that. David pretends to... Oh, this is new information. Is that true? He's like, of course he's going to do that. He's trying to look good, right? So he's going to take the... Generally the opposition is stronger to him. So he's going to go with the flow in the sense where he's just going to say, if you start agreeing with us... Right now it's not... It's advantageous for him to give in a little bit, right? But what's strange is that he is now attacking you. You're saying, well, that's rich coming from you. Rich means, like, that's bullshit. Like, how hypocritical. I am hypocritical? Yeah, it's calling you hypocritical. Why? That's what... Every time you talk, you're working so much, and he flips out, you know? You see, it's something about you that you're like... Not about you, sorry. It's about... Is that you? Like, you know, personally or something? Well, it obviously is me. Yeah. No, no. Because they're rich doing... It's something, yeah. I call it bullshit. You do. But there's something that he's always... Yes. Because he didn't see this now. So he asked the other day, no, it doesn't matter what has happened. It was terrible, and that's... Well... So why... So I am making... I was lying about... I know. So you think I don't know? So I'm making... You're driving nuts. Yeah. But... Let's compare with me. It's just my prisons. I think so. Yeah. And you look... Because we talked about it the other night. Something about women. He's the only woman. He's not good with them. He's got, you know, history with bad behavior, you know? So, yeah. And he says I'm being rich like I'm... No, rich is not critical. Right? It's not what being rich means in America. Okay, wait. That's not on me. That's on you guys. I forget this is a girl, right? Well, look, I did not trust you. I did not trust you. That's fine. And I'm not... The camera's here, and I've... Can you hear that just one more time? I don't know what he's saying. He says he's being hypocritical about it. Did I hear it for you first of all? In English? I would have... But remember this. This is why also, I feel that this is disingenuous in that he says that the camera crew have got a camera crew here. And I've told him three times, I'm not with Val. I will leave. I offered to leave, which jeopardized and risked me with you. Like, you could have walked because I said that, right? But there was no other fair way to do it in my eyes. I'm just putting it in context. But remember, Rocco, is that if he says Val, you buy a camera crew. That means that it's something he can use against me. If you come independently on your own, he can't use it against me. Exactly. That's why he says to you, as much as Val's... Right. He incriminates you. Okay. Right. So, okay. Not incriminating. It's just like, something he can use against me. You can't say, Rocco came up independently on his shelf, but you don't. You do a thing. Which is what happened. If he says that, it doesn't sound good, right? No, right. All right. Let's hear it. Very horrible reaction to him. Well, that's why I'm not in a horrible reaction here. No, I get that. I hear you. Okay. You guys are in a horrible reaction. I don't feel any sincerity, but... Well, look. Part of... Can I just say, Marie, it's a little rich to say, I'm not showing enough feeling when you blindside me by having a camera crew here to record it. I'm being very careful about the facial expressions I use, being very cognizant of the fact that there's a camera recording this. And that's not on me. That's on you guys. I forget that there's a camera, right? Well, look. I did not trust you. I did not trust you. That's fine. And I'm not... The camera's here, and I've given my permission for the camera. They're not here for you, first of all. Well... They're doing a thing about me, and you happen to be part of my life story right now. Is that so? Okay? It's not... I only bring up the camera in the context of, if you feel like I'm not exhibiting enough emotion or senior sincere, that's probably a something... That's not what she's saying. That's not what she's saying. That's not what she's saying. That's not what she's saying. I'm sorry. And that's it. And I appreciate it. No, I felt it. He made me... I didn't appreciate it. I felt it. I think he meant it. He said sorry. I think he meant his apology. I just don't think he understands the gravity of what he's done. And I think this is why I wanted him to know. I want him to see it. I want to show, not tell. Okay? The fiction is one major thing. Her friend, my Marie's friends, I mean, could you really call them friends, though? I mean, could you call them friends? No, Marie, could you call them... No, no, no, please. I mean, these people are terrible anyway. Yes. You know, fuck them. But it's not that. It's Marlo. Because this is a... You have two kids, so you know it's like going to school, having play dates, and kids playing with other kids, right? Yep. You know the parents interact with each other. It's a social thing. Yep. Right? So when a parent is ostracized, the kid is ostracized. Yeah, I definitely know what you mean. And that breaks my heart to hear that. And never before that. But that is a direct consequence of your act. Well, that makes me feel awful. Well, I'm glad you did. It makes me feel awful. Look, the... But I have a few choices. You can do something about it, but you cannot do anything about it. What would you like me to do? What I would like you to do is I'd like you to rewrite this problem. You'd like me to rewrite the article? Yeah. Well, that's not really the way we roll. I mean, I don't care. I don't care how you roll. This is what I like. You ask me what I like. I would like you to... I don't know. I'd like you to keep going. I'd like you to rewrite the article. I'd like you to make a statement. A... Marlo. Because this is a... You have two kids, so you know it's like going to school, having play dates, and kids playing with other kids, right? Yep. You know the parents interact with each other, so it's a social thing. Yep. Right? So when a parent is ostracized, the kid is ostracized. Get money from Ray Van. Yay! Sponsorship. You know, I was on a boat with McAfee, and he stole my Ray Vans. He wouldn't give them back to me, and he said the same fucking thing. Really? That's weird. And Ray Van was a sponsor, so I'm sure they enjoyed it, but it never aired, so... What's your status? We'll call Ray Van. Yeah, I... I definitely know what you mean, and that breaks my heart to hear that. And never before. But that is a direct consequence of your act. Well, that makes me feel awful. Well, I'm glad. Who is Nengar? You're right. It makes me feel awful. I am... Look, I have a few choices. You can do something about it, or you can not. What would you like me to do? What I would like you to do is I'd like you to rewrite this properly. You'd like me to rewrite the article? Yeah. Well, that's not really the way to do it. I don't care how you roll. This is what I like. You ask me what I would like. I would like you... I would like you to rewrite the article. I would like you to make a statement, a public fucking apology. Not on Twitter. Make it a little more public than that. Well, Val, I would like you to go over your own fucking article, or forensically like I did, and say this is where I was wrong. This is where I was right. This is where I apologize for it. This is what I've done. I would like you to say, you know what? I was careless with people. I was careless with my source. I was careless with my friend. I was careless. I fucked up. And I didn't think about how this would affect other people. I didn't realize that I, David, had a voice that few people do. And that's the New York Times. And this is not just a rinky-dinky paper in the middle of fucking Swaziland. This is the New York Times. And to put a character assassination piece on the front of the fucking New York Times, man. There's a lot of power. And you wielded that power, very carelessly, out of your own self fucking interest. I disagree with that last one. Let me finish my sentence now. You wielded that power against me in a very selfish way. And carelessly. Because you were angry at me. You did not consider the effects that they would have on me, Marie, and Marlo in our lives. You were just filled with anger and rage. And you took it out on me. And the best way you knew how, I said fuck that. I got him out. New York Times. But you didn't consider how that would work. You know what? What's frightening means that you did consider that. And you knew what the consequences would be. That's what scares me. And that's why I had to double down the others. And this is just part one. It's your imagination at school. We went to... Sorry, that was for vote here. No, I'm sorry. We went most recently to a parent-teacher conference. And my future ex-husband starts quoting you and asking Val to leave. Yeah. Screaming at him in front of everybody. And he had to leave. And he leaves half the time with Marlo. He couldn't stay. How could he stay? Well, the New York Times was wrong. I'm going to leave. The New York Times? It must be true. Yes. That's what we get. And Dragon Age and all of this. He's been going for a long time. You don't know what I mean. What we mean is that you're a part of the New York Times. You're a part of his life. Which means you could also be famous. It could also be cool. But just don't think about others too. You're in the New York Times. Because because you're part of his life, the council is you. You're right, Marlo. Think about others too. And you are right that it's really important to consider and remember the power that the Times wields. And especially when it's writing about the things that people... You're right. But David, there's a power in there. I know what you did to me. I thought it was just a nasty thing between us. But then I asked around a bit. And that wasn't the first one. Nobody was surprised. No one was surprised. I asked around. And you're not very well-liked amongst journals. It's fine. Oh, it's because you're so smart. Sources. It's because not only because of... Well, the fellow journalist, what I heard recently, he seemed to... One said, you brag a lot about your stories. Which I thought, okay, so what? So I moved to David Bragg's big fucking deal. And then he said something more like, well, he would steal stories from other people. I mean, he would get a lead that one guy would get. And then he would come in and snag it. And then sort of say, oh, but I'll give you the first byline. I'll give you the first word. And then he'll take it back. And I'm like, okay, so fine. So there's some under... I'm sure... I don't work in this business. I don't know how it goes. I'm sure there's sneaky stuff that happens. Everyone's out for their own best interest. And they want to get their stories out there. I get it. David's an ambitious guy. And I respect that about you. You're ambitious. And then I hear a story about a woman who came to you. And, oh, you found her. I'm not sure which one it was, but she was your source for sexual harassment suits or sexual harassment things going on at some major bank. And she came to you and she trusted you implicitly. And the way you wrote the story was in favor of the accuser, of the man who sexually harassed this woman. And she was decimated. She was decimated. I've never written a story about sexual harassment, I think. Are you sure? What? Not at the New York Times. No, I've never. Not once. But before the New York Times. Nope. Never have done it. Well, let's bring up the thing. You want to do that now? Yeah. Let's bring it up. Okay, look, Google... Google... I don't want... She said not to say her name. Is her name Lauren? I told you, I'm not saying her name. Is it for names Lauren? I can tell you what your... No, Lauren. Tell me. There it is. Absolutely not. You're saying... I'm not saying... Please can cut out this name. I'm not going to play a guessing game with this. If you guys want to... I'm asking you. If you will cut out the name. Yeah, yeah. So tell me the story. No, I'm not... What happened? Absolutely not. It's your chance to defend yourself. I'll take my chances on that. I'll take my chances on that. If you guys want to make an accusation of... I didn't make the accusation. If someone were to make an accusation, they're welcome. I am relaying information to you. I have... I have... Relay away or don't? I just did relay. Okay, well that's not... What you said is not true. So what's your side? I've never written a story about sexual harassment in a bank. So your facts are obviously a fundamental problem. No, well you seem... They're facts. You seem to know something about this. And they know you very well. If you... You said the name and then... Is that the right name? Yes, that's the right name. I'll tell you what happened. And more than one source. Is the right name? Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened. I was an editor on that story. There's other people who wrote that story, not me. And they didn't like the story. They thought that she didn't get the... They thought that Victor, the alleged perpetrator, got more sympathy than she did. Right. That was very... Was that? Yeah, it certainly wasn't at me. Because that's really interesting. Because he said he didn't write the story, but he was the editor. And being an editor is choosing what comes out. Right. If you say that... Right? Right? Right? Oh, you're looking at it again. So, okay. An editor from the story. There are other people who write the story. Again, that's his classic thing. Blaming others. One small. This story. No, I'm not... What happened? Absolutely... There's your chance to defend yourself. I'll take my chance on that. I'll take my chance on that. If you guys want to make an accusation... I didn't make the accusation. If someone wants to make an accusation, they're welcome. I am relaying information to you. I have... Relay away or done? I just did relay. Okay, well, that's not... What you said is not true. That's interesting. He thinks we're accusing them. That's really weird. Okay. No, but he backed us on that. This is one of the things I really need context on. What do you mean? So, I don't understand. Because we have the footage of you calling the other reporters. Right? No. I'm going to have to call him too at some point and see what, you know, to be ethical, what we can use there. Okay. Yeah. Even though we asked him. We did not. But it's different when... He didn't know that it was me publicly disseminated, right? Okay. You did ask him. Technically, you're correct. Okay. Have you not come again? Yeah, I don't want to come again either. Can you just... I have to talk to a lawyer and see what the laws are on that. Because if I put it out, it might be different. That's all. If we say you're being recorded... Doesn't matter. Okay. I'm just going to check with the lawyer. They will know the answer. They will know the answer. It doesn't matter. If it's a yes, then I have things to consider. If it's a no, there's not a discussion. Are you okay? Because it's the one way... No, no. We're careful. It's okay. Listen. It doesn't matter. It's not a law thing. It doesn't matter. Because often... He's saying it's not a law thing. It's about... No, it is a law thing. It's a camera thing. I can check first if it's a law thing. And if it's not, then yes. There's like a... Why are you saying it doesn't matter? courtesy thing. Why are you saying it doesn't matter? It doesn't matter in the context of this conversation. Because the conversation... It matters in the context of the film. I want to put that in there. So, so you're clear. She said it was us two in New York. He said it doesn't matter. We're asking for it. This... Whether or not I can include that in the film, doesn't matter in the context of this conversation. What he told you matters. What he told you, I don't... Not quite clear on. What did that reporter tell you about this story that you're referencing with David? Okay. You were there. I know I was there. I don't understand it. How could I... Why did I get the recording? No, no. I've listened to the recording too. I'm asking you like what... I still don't fully grasp. First of all, I grasp what the reporter said. What I'm not grasping is why you said he thinks you're accusing them. Cusing him? Because I see that. We don't know either. That's what's interesting. Because he's so guilty. Because he's so fucking guilty. But he knows the story you're referencing. He gets it in a second. We blocked. We did not know anything except what we just said. We said, you were there. You heard it with us from... I know, I know. I'm just... That's what we know. That's it. There was something about a girl on a story. Okay. For a moment he was at the Wall Street Journal. A girl, he would use as a source about a sexual harassment case. That was at JP Morgan, right? Morgan Stanley. And Morgan Stanley, okay. And he used her as a source and he told her that, you know, it's going to be about her a terrible ordeal. Defending her. Defending her. He writes a story. The story takes sympathy for the accuser, the man. The bank. The Razor guy. And the bank. Which again... She's upset about that because he totally flipped on her. She's pissed off at him. He flipped on her. That's all we knew. We didn't even know her name. And he gave it... He just fucking gave it away. Made it. And Matt refused to give us her name because they're friends. Because they're friends. And Matt... Okay. That makes sense, I understand. Here is Matt, Matt's colleague. And also Matt is now in New York. But when this happened, he was living in London. Right. Okay. All makes sense. Thank you. No, no. What's the point? There's a second possibility, actually. Second possibility is this couldn't have been. Another story. Clearly fucking different. Yeah. I think it's the same story. That's... I'm think, but you're right. It could be. We should ask Matt if the name is... He might not tell you. Because he looks so angry. You're right. He's so angry that you're putting him on the spot. Yeah. He got red, too. His face blushed. David thought... He doesn't know what to do. He's stuck. Yeah. He's like on the trial. But he went straight to accusations. Yes, that's what I mean. The other trial. That's a show of guilt. Yes. That's interesting. Because we were just asking a question. So what happened? Yeah. We just... No, we weren't just asking a question. I mean... We were showing that there's history. Oh, pattern. The pattern of inferring sources. Yes. But I think this and Eric looking at that must be fucking on his head. Eric, the... But what did you think we were accusing him of? Of... What did you say? Of burning a source. Sexual harassment? No. No. Of not defending a victim. No. When you accuse somebody, you accuse them of something. A crime. Yes. Accusing that he didn't help the source. How is that a crime? Accusation. Accusation. Something is severe. No, that's not severe. You're accusing me of, right? You're accusing me of... Robert, what could it be? I don't know. Let's go backwards. I think I'm going to say it again. I did, I did. What? None of the New York Times. Okay. I do have to... I'm just kind. You know, I respect that. Hours. Hours. I'm just... And then I hear a story about a woman... And we have... Look how much time there is, right? One hour, right? One hour. Okay. So I... Over there. Recording. Who came to you... Recording. And... Oh, you found her. I'm not sure which one it was. But she was your source for sexual harassment suits or sexual harassment thing that's going on at some major bank. And she came to you and she trusted you implicitly. And the way you wrote the story was in favor of the accuser, of the man who sexually harassed this woman. What? What? What? I've never written a story about sexual harassment right back. Are you sure? What? Not at the New York Times. No, I've never. Not once. But before the New York Times. Nope. Never have done it. Well, let's bring up the thing. You want to do that now? Yeah. Let's bring it up. Okay. Look. Google... Google... I don't want... She said not to say her name. Is her name Lauren? I told you that. I'm not saying her name. Yeah. Yeah. Because if her name is Lauren, I can tell you what you're referring to. You're saying... Please can cut out this name. I'm not going to play a guessing game with this. If you guys want to... I'm asking... We will cut out the name. Yeah, yeah, I'm confused. So tell me the story. No, I'm not... What happened? Absolutely... Defend yourself. I'll take my chances on that. I'll take my chances on that. If you guys want to make an accusation... I didn't make the accusation. If some of them are making an accusation, they're welcome. I am relaying information to you. I have... I don't think you think so. Relay away or don't. I just did. I don't think you think so. What you said is not true. So what's your side? I've never written a story about sexual harassment in the bank. That's my side. Okay. So your facts are obviously fundamentally wrong. No. They're facts. See, you seem to know something about this. And they know you very well. If you... You said the name and then you said... Is that the right name? If that's the right name, I'll tell you what happened. What happened? It's the right name. It's the right name? Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened. I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a... I was in... I was in... I was in a... I was in... I was in a... I was in a... I was in a...ochita at the time. Something like this. But it's the right name. Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened. I was an editor on that story. There's other people who wrote that story, not me. Thank you. And they didn't like the story. They thought that she didn't get the... They thought that this is the... Or the alleged perpetrator... Got more sympathy than she did. Yes. That was why I was pissed off. Yeah. And then certainly, it wasn't me. Right, the story there was. I had nothing to do with the reporting or writing of the story. by the story by the way but there's but look this is journalism is hard Val and we get things wrong we do I do personally journalists do all the time and we it's an imperfect craft and you're gonna be able to find I'm telling look for all the corrections I've had no you're gonna find some bad ones I'm showing you a pattern okay I don't care about this corrections this is a better because there's another person tell me my pattern to talk about her lips what did you tell time you told her I'll just summarize because you don't know what I'm getting at but do you tell Tammy that you know you will take care of her that you will not you will keep her from the the wilds of other journalists you will have this tension you will you will be more hands-on as someone to protect her from what was the the repercussions of what was going to happen right because only David could do this because David is the savior here come and save the day and make your life let me tell you what I don't know what you've heard or who you've heard it from but obviously I'm and I don't even know why I'm responding to them where you just being big but I'll tell you because I Tammy did something the Tammy did something that's very crazy I tracked I've heard through the grapevine in Deutsche Bank's Jacksonville Florida offices there was a woman who had voiced concerns about Trump loans or Trump transactions and Kushner transactions and had then been fired as a result of raising those concerns I tracked Tammy down down over a period of weeks I convinced her to go on the record because I have it you don't know but I have it on audited because at the same day I was talking to the FBI they were here so and you called let me let me just if you don't mind I don't actually I just don't know why you're telling me it's something good and I know it happened the Tammy agreed after quite a while spending time with me and talking to me to do something very courageous which was to go on the record she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and decided after talking with her husband after me talking with her husband this is something she wanted to do it was extremely risky for her to do extremely extremely courageous and that I mean that's the story that's like we spent what must have been hours I think talking about the follow-up what the likely follow-up would be from this what the implications would be how other media would be pursuing her how Trump supporters would be so important because this is also what I'm going to ask Scott about tomorrow and so my record she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and decided to meet and she's Jackson, Florida about to meet the source I'm very excited about it because I haven't you don't know but I have it on audited because at the same day I was talking to the FBI they were here so and you called let me let me just if you don't mind I don't actually I just don't know why you're telling me something didn't happen I said I know it happened the Tammy agreed after quite a while spending time with me and talking to me to do something very courageous which was to go on the record she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and decided after talking with her husband after me talking with her husband but this is something she wanted to do and it was extremely risky for her to do extremely risky extremely courageous and it that I mean that's the story that's like we spent what must have been hours I think talking about the follow-up what the likely follow-up would be from this what the implications would be how other media would be pursuing her how Trump supporters would be supporting her how long and she's a very different version of the version says that she felt unprotected she felt that you left her out I find that very hard to believe but and she certainly has never communicated that to me she's communicated something to you differently look Tammy is a courageous strong person and I feel like she wants to speak for herself I totally respect that I'm not really interested in communicating with my three I am the point is I'm bringing showing you a pattern here okay tell me about Tom Hays no Tom Hays let's talk about Tom Hays yes about you are the most intense about you are the most intense longest lasting active source relations ever had Tom Hays is the second longest and second most intense Tom and I talk regularly and he regularly yes this is what I meant she said the most intense longest lasting active source relations ever had Tom Hays is the second longest and second most intense Tom and I talk regularly and he regularly yes when I met you said we don't talk at all only to the lawyer I said why yeah that's a bit of a thing well I don't know no I'm actually honestly what is that there is what does that mean because yeah when you met yeah he said what I remember I was in the apartment in Culver City I remember walking through the how long ago since this is 2018 and I was walking through all the dirty clothes on the floor picking them up David came in still we can help Tom because you give him some of the Deutsche Bank files to show that he because I was still reading the book in the middle of the audio book of this library book and I was like oh dude this thing about Deutsche Bank we can give him a good lawyer or Tom all the files that we have and they can help them reduce the sentence and he says well I don't think that's gonna work I said why so well we don't really talk anymore so why what happened instead of that of falling out he said the wife doesn't like me at all Sarah yeah yeah that's what the text referred to that's what the text referred to yeah okay okay that's what I need clarity up yeah and I said well what I said when I get into impossible to talk to my I can only send an email I can't actually comment so I'm gonna I probably will call I can't guarantee it he said David said to me that I cannot call Tom like because it's only through a lawyer because as he's in he's in jail so through a lawyer I get an email the email it goes to the lawyer the lawyer then communicates Tom somehow you still in jail I don't know if you're sure to look it up but I think you got it since reduced by from 14 years to seven years so yes that's still me in jail but I can call and I remember yeah I know David told me he would give him his contact he's probably giving the lawyers contact we'll see lawyer yeah call it's texting Tom I'm gonna say I want Tom's contact you want to hear oh yeah yeah you said you're giving Tom's contact yeah I'm just telling you I get them from what I'm gonna do and this is dog twice there's a the proof twice because I also asked Val how can I contact Tom and he said we come because David had it falling out okay they're not talking but why did you want to contact and here you look at the files because yeah I had a Deutsche Bank shit and I thought I could get a sentence reduced we can show that he how we help here though because the Deutsche Bank hold on Deutsche Bank trader was doing more illegal shit than Tom so Tom wasn't he was taken to fall for all these other guys doing shit and Tom just didn't care David told me like Tom didn't carry like Tom's out to destroy the world like he's a really care like he's in jail so how can I care he's in fucking jail I know he's telling me like Tom is an autistic like savant sort of thing and that he's out there and he wants the whole world to burn down not just the banks it's like what it didn't make any sense so he just shot down the idea of helping me helping this guy I could have that was when they were in the falling out yeah since game regain contact no but doesn't we don't know the truth it's a falling out either way David said that no I said here's a bunch of shit let's assume let's go by as well don't know the point is what it's more important now I realized that because imagine if you're in jail and some writer decides your life for you he's like fucking Davis decide no this don't give it to him it's not even give a trot well there's a lot of steps that would have to be proven but it's hypothetically could happen but also the point is how David interacts with his life yes how hard is it for me to give him a bunch of files and David hand those files to the lawyer it's not difficult especially when you want to supposedly help your soul right so it's like what the fuck he refuses he didn't well there's a fine line I'm not saying that you got it wrong or right I'm saying that the only way to really know is talk to Tom and say you know you're talking about different things on what we're talking about is this did David have a falling out with Tom and did he then regain access that's the question that's for you that's your question my question I don't have a question I'm just I'm pointing out I'm a member of realization that this happened okay that prompt can I interject because I am now imagining how many people I've reached out to David to talk to Val and how many times has he blocked that communication the way he did for Tom Tom and I are in regular touch he Tom is a complicated person and it look Tom was another courageous person who is I feel like I've done right by if he wants to say something different or if his wife Sarah wants to say something different I respect for both of them but I stand by my handling of Tom Hayes I certainly stand by my handling of Tammy McFadden the situation you're referring to on this story I edited with Lauren is I also stand by my handling of that although I recognize that that writing with sexual harassment is very hard and it's very hard and you know what and I'm not saying that's what happened with Lauren but we make mistakes the New York Times does the journalist do I do there's and I honestly like part of the that of this it feels a little ridiculous to me is that I can own my mistakes you know I make mistakes in my professional life my personal life we all do yes and yeah well and I'm owning that so I don't feel like that's other than mine and say anything you've made a mistake with you said you stand by the story with Lauren you said you stand by the story with Tammy and fucking Tom too and Tom's 14 years in jail now does your help look I think you're presenting you a pattern that what you're talking about is great but it's irrelevant my point is that there's a pattern of people there was your sources that said that you they've been left out high and dry to hang because of you and they do not have kind of things to say about okay and you have co-workers that say not that specifically they just more address the ambition and you're sort of wanting to put yourself in the story this is this is my favorite response when I said talking about David said well and this is most politically correct response I get well David has his own style which I respect greatly but you know I just I'm not I'm not it's not my style to put myself in this time it's not my style to put myself in this time thank you that's all I have to say I can't tell you anymore let's talk again that's what I got and I have almost respect for my colleagues if some of them have issues with how I've done stuff they have not expressed but they're definitely in terms of dependence and you were in the story more do I mean isn't this story you wish you were the store now I think it's exceptionally awkward for the general but you make yourself the story they're changing well in this one me and my whistleblower and this one I definitely did it's in the town you're in my whistleblower like you own me yeah yeah sorry I've been trying to say something about Tommy also I think it's interesting that I think you've got a question you think of the golden yeah and oh God yes somebody you've been working with if I'm correct me for long for as long as you work as well and it seems like you vote a piece about Tommy based I don't know whether proof of what you were recording but what to me was striking is that you have worked with Val for so many years it was basically second wife and it's provided with all the document all the receipt all the proof that you needed and that was not enough but Tommy told you something and that was enough in her word that's exactly brilliant thank you yes yes oh but tell me it's great and I'm no reason genius you know why because that is exactly right you go down the floor you talk to Tammy you come back with no documentary evidence nothing at all but her work and you publish that and the world listens to it's like oh well it's a New York times it must be true I come to you with hundreds of thousands of fucking documents and futile documents you're fucking futile all right and then you do this to me and you discredit me but let my documents and speak to themselves well that was a fucking asshole but the documents are speaking to themselves sometimes and then you have absolutely nothing with Tammy you come back with these stars reports alleged stars reports you don't even think about Susan Scarrett you probably didn't think about it right now Susan Scarrett is the one that fucking has me fucking David think about you could have gotten them from there but no it was enough for you to get a word from Tammy and then spin it as he did into this big huge story which Tammy ended up suffering from and still does today she didn't want all this publicity she's one people howling here she's a lot like anyone into this with her eyes wide open that's what she there perhaps she did but the way I mean again she's not here Tammy did something really courageous and took a lot of personal risks and I I can't tell you the admiration I have and you know what Tammy was here saying something to me saying to me what you were saying she said to you I guess like I would have a very different reaction I these I have I just have the utmost respect respect thank you we all respect me yes thank you where's my respect and my courageous I have a lot of respect for you are you are where is that in this story show me waiters it don't tell me fucking show me where is it in your profile my I don't know where it is if it's not in their values should be I have respect for you I have a lot of respect well it doesn't feel like me please please please he does he gets it he gets it it's David do you understand what's going on here do you understand what we're trying to tell you yes it seems in a way I'm being targeted by you and you target me now I could there's millions of little we've been armchair psychology just for a long time and I took it back to the beginning when I first met you when you're stalking me for about a month and a half and I kept saying no no no back the fuck off until I until I was at David Grant David Grant I said I mean you don't you don't know this about Florida to you but I said David Grant I said David I don't know anything about journalists you're the only journalist you're not even David Grant at the time was no longer a journalist he was the he wrote lots of easy now he's a superstar writer but at the time he was willing to help me because he knew journalists you know deal with them I said there's this one guy that's fucking driving me nuts and David Enrich or Enrich they called you Enrich still at the time because they pronounce it the proper German German but sorry that's just an old joke you're supposed to laugh I'm not finding this amusing I know it's great for me though but anyway please so I said David can you get this fucking guy off my back he's driving me crazy he's sending letters to my mother my little sisters I mean that everybody is he's bothering us can you help me with it and David says yes of course let me let me do my best but David Grant is a timid kind guy he does not like to confrontation and he didn't and he feels pretty bad about it but he didn't come he didn't get you off my back and you kept pushing and he kept pushing and he kept pushing and then you called one day and he said Val I'm gonna write the story whether you like it or not you can say something you can give me some documents you can tell me some more about your father's relationship to Anshun or all that shit okay or I'm just gonna publish one of the fuck I want and I was like you know fuck you remember this conversation and then I hung up and then you published Bill Brooksman kills himself amid anxiety and fear into library bro library bro right at the time I'm like what the fuck's a library right I don't know shit about finance I taught myself finance probably last five years okay at that time I didn't know what the fuck I was talking about it took me a few years and I really should have thought through a little bit better but I didn't but I was such a fool at that time but that was exactly the time you were writing your book on live or exactly at that time yes it was because you at well you want proof of three months later you're asking me I'm writing a book on a library Val do you can you search these documents to your father's father's right you wrote me a list to search for specifically a book no I'm thinking Jesus did David just use my father's name to promote his book on live or that's what I'm thinking and I couldn't believe it I started writing a book in the summer no one knows why anyone kills themselves what gives you the right to say this is why Bill Brooksman kills himself what gives you the right to say that's not what that article said that's what the title says literally that's what the heading said read it who's got it we're looking at the internet it's not everyone's fun okay tell me what's I would like you to know who the by-lines are on this article take a look well tell you my name is on there and I'm not sure it is it's the 4th of 4 by-lines okay library Brooksman I'll show you and my dad has nothing to do with library and you know that so this is important to you because you don't know yeah I need context so he when he wrote this story I was a Sausalito I remember and David he was the one calling me no one else did no one else called me he was constantly calling me asking me to comment asking me to comment I said no no no and he says well I'm gonna publish it tomorrow then it's your last chance after a week of this said no it's nothing I can't no comment the story comes out and it says written by David Enbridge and Jenny Strasberg had a third thing let's look it up right now and now he's saying oh I'm not the only one yeah so he's trying to blame someone else on it and it's clearly him and also his book was on library weeks later he would say hey look up these things for me I'm writing a book on library look up these keywords in your dad's files see Brooksman suicide um this is the library this is the keywords it's not Deutsche Bank executive dismissal library fixing is conspiracy no no it's uh here executive who committed suicide anxious admits Deutsche Bank probes that's what's in the title executive who committed suicide anxious he said it's not in the title Deutsche Bank probes former top banker was involved in investigations he felt abandoned by his colleagues by dogs that's what he said in the book he keeps up that same thing Jenny Strasberg what does that mean? nothing I'm just wondering if that was his excuse my name is last on the byline so it's um it's not really me like the sexual harassment I was the editor not really me like Kenny so Aika's on it and David Enrich and um the first book is about library and that's what he's tried to do promote use his source to promote the book like Schrocker just said he subconsciously said it was me what? that he subconsciously said yes I did he did he said yes I did it sounds like he said no I didn't but we'll review that close to this and by the way just so you guys know why I thought about this comfortable reviewing this with you one because of David leaking the text to me and I feel I'm not a print journalist and I'm not a um of writing a book and I understand how both of those things work I'm shooting a documentary in this case you're writing a book? no I'm saying I'm not writing a book for this and I'm not a print journalist I'm shooting a documentary and a documentary the great thing about it that's as close as you get to real life a representation so the fact that he leaked me the text and the fact that this is the daily's content I'm not reviewing any other footage with you I'm only reviewing this because I need context and to do it like where I question you like he would that's a print journalist that's not what I'm doing here and um yeah I don't like I'm gonna do a split screen in some instances so you know like old 70's movies I'm gonna say I'm stylizing that like that is what I'm thinking in my head so like you dress like this actually makes a big sense in that case and not in a funny way but like you know what I mean it's almost like you're taking the piss it's like having without knowing it's like you saying something him saying something and then like boof you know what I mean and it will pause one I like that idea that's actually an idea that people cannot refute I think it's like the one way facts don't matter in a lot of cases to at least convince someone these days which is terrible but so it is that sort of stuff well I mean if you put even Trump saying you know I didn't rape that baby and then you have him raping a baby people are gonna see him raping a baby even his supporters are gonna say okay yeah you probably rape that baby sorry he's the worst example possible terrible image man Trump just raping babies thank you for that image I want to point out something else oh really? that after this first day David is sending you an email to influence your documentary well he did influence everybody influences my documentary but maybe not the way he wanted right? yeah yeah I'm not gonna do that my job is hang on when you are not being commissioned by Val right no I mean Val's gonna kiss me already a couple of times you know but he's pretending that you are well of course cause it helps him but I saved the daily microphone the first thing I said is I'm not you know I'm not Val's crew I am my crew I asked you know I reached out to Val and he said yes go go go eat how are you? go here are you okay? are you okay? oh no are you okay? no yeah I think they let me get them I'm amazed man you you okay thank you alright Steve's got some text Steve's really pissed off the reason he's going in and the more she ignores him the more the more you ignore me the closer I get you got a lovely singing voice look at you we got jam I forgot you played too alright what's your jam let me see this what's your play if you'll come back on I'm gonna waste time yeah cause I do have to go what's the other thing? wait Val hang on there's you've seen showed it to me you have the documents that his psychologist and his doctor wrote to the coroner that very clearly says that he expressed anxiety about the library investigation he expressed anxiety about a lot of things but you chose library because you were writing about library right? maybe subconsciously maybe didn't consciously explicitly this psychologist in the doctor's report cite the government investigations into library is what Bill, your father told them they cite a lot more than just that but you picked and she is the one that worked for you there you go there's the title executive is committed suicide anxious amid Deutsche Bank pros okay former top banker is involved in investigations investigations felt abandoned by colleagues he's a share Janice Strasberg, Dallas Turner Ikenning Ikenning what does that mean? well that means the by lines in general so the first by lines the person who did most of the work second so fourth is the most important I have to give them appropriate time because if I say to them when is the daily airing if you think it's mid-march I'll try to figure out but I can't bug them till mid-march I'll find out I told you guys I wouldn't proceed your airing but I also said that if you didn't air it all bets are off so give me an air date and give me a final air date and like I'm editing my film I'm giving you a courtesy because really I told you these were the stakes what did you tell me you were from where I was from? do they ask you like what were you doing? I'm starting a new company I told them very clearly I have my logos and stuff I'm ready to launch we're going to call it scanner that's good it's true too I have a contract in my clause that says if any of this shit gets messed up with the business until the new operating room is formed that I control the footage and I own it it's an independent film right now I know where I want to air it and on my new platform but I'm saying I still have a few things to get sorted out I missed what you said right after that 15-20 seconds he's saying something maybe subconsciously I don't know the psychologist in the doctor's report cite the government investigations into the library as what Bill your father told them they cite a lot more than just that but you picked and she is the one that worked for you guys there you go there you go there's the title executive committed suicide anxious for top bankers involved investigation investigation is felt abandoned by colleagues this is Sherry Jenny Strasberg Giles Turner Ikenning and David Ennerich what does that mean well that means byline is in general so the first byline is the person who did most of the work so fourth is the least important so you were the least important so why did you call me and tell me you're going to write whatever you want I mean I obviously never said that but you're the editor right at the time I was a reporter you were not an editor at the Wall Street Journal this time I think my title was European banking editor but that was kind of like a reporting editor so these were not your subordinates you did not work for you I think maybe Jenny who's the first one named Jenny is the first one I stand by the story we can just skip you stand by the story what do you think someone would read this if they don't know anything about you know how newspapers are I don't remember here's the question he says that he was a reporter editor but his title was European banking editor an editor writes the headlines a reporter does not write the headlines so if you're a reporter a lot of times the reporter will get pissed because the headline is not indicative of the story or they feel so yes an editor writes the headlines now there's some blurry lines there but what I'm saying is if he was both the editor and the reporter there's no way around him knowing what the headline would have been and that's something that you know that's better for me to talk to him about because I am an editor and was an editor and I can say to him how do you explain that because I know for a fact in the New York Times I'm sure reporters have influence and perhaps your standards well first of all what's your standard now what's your public editor say about how you present what the headline might be to the reporters and sometimes there's so little time between finishing the story and writing the headline they don't get to see it I don't know what your policy is what's your policy it's probably different with every case but a lot of times maybe they don't see it they're just so antiquated that the headline may be laid out and the story is still there and so they don't see it until it goes to print at the same time I'm pretty sure they have a big screen in the New York Times, I know they do that every day the entire day as the layout person makes the paper you see it in real time I believe that's the case I know the screen is there and I believe it's in real time Is that the Wall Street Journal though at the time they would have a similar system just probably not projected against the wall the Wall Street is what's that? I was looking for this ashram I know it's in my left the whole time but you're saying there's no way around it he might have an explanation but even so he says I stand by my story so let's say you go to New York and he says I stand by my story that's what he said the headline is important and you know this as an editor but the headline is usually that anyone 72% there's I'll find the number 72% is what they read so it's very important and as the editor and reporter I need to know who wrote the headline if it wasn't you who wrote the headline did you see it? and I have several points that I'm going to address with you that I think that will make this very fair but the power and balance here in terms of who's writing about whom we know what that is and I'll take that into account I don't need to show you this is it they know this there's an empowering balance you say it to them there's an empowering balance in that relationship for everyone that's a source and a journalist there is indicative and that's what this show is about it's about how are you portrayed versus who you are and the truth is somewhere in between and no one gets 100% right all the time 99% it's hard to get 100% right he's right about that but that's not an excuse he's using it as an excuse that's what I'm saying I'm not I'm not a place to blame and blame is not a thing here I'm not here to blame anyone's feet I know you are that's why I'm filming you the bankers died and they read this and said Deutsche Bank pros what is the subtext is your point that he was a target of investigation to them what is the subtext target of investigations and he kills himself because of the library that's what you're saying that's what this title says about my father it's fair it doesn't say he killed himself because of the library but yes the most people 50% of people at the very least are going to assume exactly that's the nature of it and David just said he just gave it away he doesn't know why I'm pissed off so he interrupted me to say do you mean because I wrote he was the target of the investigation I don't even know that but yes that's part of it he's guilt is saying Valis thinks I'm because I wrote him the target of the investigation I'm going to talk about this stuff tomorrow tomorrow is going to be a long day dude is that okay with you if Scott doesn't make it look honestly it's not the end of the world because there's so much to talk about because that right there the context of that people aren't going to understand from the book nor well I guess he gets into it a little bit in the book but they're not going to understand the history that you guys have had and the first article I'm not going to say it glosses over that history he admits that I think he admits I think it's fair to say and I'm not saying this the footage will say this and people have their own thing Frost Nixon then just got Nixon to admit he apologizes why is he apologizing well I'm not saying that I have to get more clarification on why he apologizes because him saying this to you of course he's nervous man and I do give him credit for apologizing but as you said and we have you on camera and so I'm okay saying this but he'll apologize so were you surprised by his apology you at least expected it as a possibility you said that it's really interesting it's really interesting this is the anybody else in the room reads this line going in naked you've made your point pal I disagree but I respect where you're coming from and I hear you and also I have never thankfully been in a situation as terrible as what you've been through I cannot begin to imagine the hurt and the trauma that you have experienced I can't please why did you exploit it then I certainly did not try to exploit it how much money have you made off of me and my father how much money have you made off of myself I don't think I've made I've received what I would consider in the publishing industry a relatively meager advance and it's there's healthcare you have $1.5 million house we have cars that's what this is you have cars I have a toyota 2017 toyota scene at minivan a proper job so that's the thing about the minivan it's important I'm very proud to say that why because at New York Times there's a whole thing on him having a minivan there's a story about David Enrich New York Times reporter owns a minivan I shoot minivans all the time I know but remember the whole course David wants to be the story he knows how to do good he knows PR a little bit that's for sure but remember what he was saying he was a part of the story he wishes he was being reported on and here he is in the New York Times and Maria and I saw that he was like oh my god he is the Hunter S. Thompson of Banking Reporting yes look the point is that he pushed someone at the New York Times to say do a story about me and here's how he got himself into the story about him immersion what do you call it it goes to show it proves my point basically I'm trying to establish a point like I said before he's trying to be a part of the story and that means he's got to elevate himself he's got power and control over the story that he's writing that's one thing he's got control over me so he's going to put himself in this position put me down here dismissing me makes me a terrible person and asshole discredit me and then he got himself into a story about him owning a minivan a knife whatever the fuck it was doesn't matter he was in the story finally all his life finally I'm in the New York Times story about me is what he's thinking right I know this fucking guy so that he comes out and says that he thinks it's cute and funny because that's not meant for me that's not meant for you that's meant for his friends at the New York Times that comment right there Michael Barbaro and the guy that he's with right now and everyone he knows in the New York Times that's what that is for that's what that comes for and that's trying to get a laugh from his colleagues okay well I don't think they're gonna laugh at this but I don't think that is anything to do with you or your dad well for the last five years because that would seem to be the focus this book will bring you money I know but I hope probably not but that's what it's meant for in his head he's trying to get that after that I worked for free how much have I made you didn't know what I made I've never really seen I've never fucking had how do you get per month from this project my father my documents other than $5,000 thank you that's another thing why did you say thank you you know Glenn Simpson paid me $5,000 why did you say pay me one I believe it says that he paid me one upfront the rest of the $5,000 he owed you $10,000 he only paid you half of that that means he paid you $5,000 but you said you paid me $1,000 no I said just bring the documents right there it's not okay here's the one the other big thing this is the other big one I don't want to pick everything let me just give you the other big one the other big one was Dan Gold you have the recording I made of Dan Goldman and I screamed at each other why is this important okay so in the book yeah in the book and in the article he says that Dan Goldman that I approached Dan Goldman first of all and the reason why I approached him is because he asked me to I approached Dan Goldman for money is it give me money or you don't get these documents did you say that no never once no I haven't really I see it for money yes you did but that didn't even mean me I don't go around that's the fucking thing who wants to do for money I'm gonna offer you money Glenn yes Glenn said I offer you $10,000 oh I understand I'm gonna give you $10,000 $10,000 and it's because what's your name I'm gonna ask Glenn I know a guy that's gonna you don't know the fucking story that's all I was referring to the point is Dan Goldman said this is at least coming from David and it is true because later Dan will back us up David says Val asked Dan Goldman for a job and then they subpoenaed him that's what he said and in the book and there's a bunch of bullshit and then later when article comes out and I'm pissed off and I'm like what the fuck is this shit and I'm like David fuck you asshole how could you do this to me you fucking piece of shit asshole you totally scream me over you know what I think I was very fair and here's an example look I left this out because I thought it would be just too much there was a press release saying Val Brooksman was trying to extort us and then we subpoenaed him because we would refuse to give him any money that's what Dan Goldman said I was like what the fuck so I go scrolling through my text and I find the ones with Dan Goldman and I see and I bring it up and I send it to them the ones with Dan Goldman said what really happened I called Dan Goldman and I'll give you the fucking files I think I already sent them to you okay in the Dan Goldman conversation I said dude give me, I'll work as an intern just fucking let me have some oversight you don't have to pay me quote you don't have to pay me how many times do I have to say you don't have to pay me and David surprised oh Valash says pay me I was like what the fuck and you don't know the thing now the reviews are coming every single word about him is the last one which I think is the Washington Post and the New York Times says he has been extorting money to buy drugs yes what the fuck are you showing it I'll send it to you anyway so that's the text Dan Goldman and the real story is I was trying to tell him I said no I just want some oversight into my father's stuff into how his emails are used could misuse them could use them to profit on and take them out of context and talk shit about my father so that's what I wanted and I said well fine well fuck you and said well we can always subpoena you I said well good luck with that and I'm just a guy you're going to subpoena me and you look like an asshole subpoena me and also you went to go meet David secretly to inquire about his stories I'm going to bring that up in a minute and David went to the side of the point but he said four months later nice to meet you and then I'm watching shit flail on national television and he's fucking up he doesn't have anything and I know it and so I look it's like a fucking I feel bad I'm like I should help so I call up I didn't call it I text him and I can give you all the fucking text about it I text him I text Dan Goldman so look Dan we go on to a bad start here you know look I have a couple things I know are going to help you send it to you one of them is to breach your boards for fucking sake you're going to like it let me just give it to you but the thing is I'm working with David behind so the only way to make this look good is if you give me no choice please subpoena me you couldn't be fucking clear if you subpoena me now I'll be able to give it to you right away and he replies that's a great idea we'll do that on Monday then the following Monday you can see subpoena as me I didn't have the text I said that I didn't have the text I didn't know you this is a much bigger this is important I need those I need those tomorrow fuck we have a lot to cover tomorrow I'll have to come back but we need some time in between we need to process this start editing and then I'll know what I need to fill in because I'm going to have to come back and get another two days with you guys but it'll be good because if we really air it we'd give it some time whatever you need to do you do it I don't know that the fallout if this was wrong this is how I'll know in the film if David's reporting was wrong or if the loaned documents exist I don't think someone will find those documents within the next few weeks or in the next two months and that person will be here I'm saying it's going to put eyes on it again so the shake up from this isn't over I don't think your story is anywhere near over I'm really hoping it is I think it's nearing the final act I think it's about to get real or maybe it just goes away but again the point is that David has mistakes I was mad at him he just got the text and he even doubled down by sending a letter I already told him I have to go see I say give me money I want to go give me your fucking money I won't give you anything never once that I come up in fact what I did say was that Dan I want to work in any capacity to have some oversight into how my fathers emails are used because they could be abused by anybody the context is important I will take a job as an intern you can pay me zero I will work for free I will fetch coffee I just want some say on how it's used say them to take and in your book not the book but your fucking art profile you say Val has been extorting Adam Schiff's people asking for money trying to get anything he can extort extort somebody get him his work right at the screen sorry if I'm saying something but after that when you printed it out she said well actually I have this letter from David wait what am I looking for David said where are you search extort he doesn't say oh sorry this is important because David I was so mad at David I was texting him I was texting him find the section I don't even know what I'm looking for here this is probably the wrong story tell me a fat story listen this was important okay fine maybe there's some I can't remember remember how angry I was yeah I'll never forget how do you remember what you copied and pasted just let me finish my sentence you might remember you copied and pasted a press release for Madame Schiff's people tango about me you said something akin to Val look how kind I am to you because I left this out yeah that sounds about right what did they say it was an on the record statement they provided I don't remember it was maybe they had used the word extort is that possible I don't remember but I do have it and you have it in your emails too it's a paraphrase because I didn't my email might take me a while to find it I didn't want to spend an hour I'll give it to you and I'll give it to you as well they said what was the fuck I can't remember now Val Brooks who came to us trying to get a job maybe they didn't use the word extort to extort us and get money from us and we said no yeah right so look Val look how kind I was to you to leave this out we subpoenaed him because we didn't want to stand for his bullshit or whatever it was and so I'm like what the fuck I'm reading this and he said look Val I'm so kind I didn't put this in and then I said David something you don't know and I sent you the text and you said that you had basically after the anger phone call with him and with you and Goldman that you would basically I believe that you had Marlo please don't kick him I believe that you had basically invited him to subpoena you that's exactly right that's what I did Goldman after we had you didn't stare with me just to be clear until after the article that's right because I didn't know that before right but I let you know about it so what happened was Goldman I got a huge fight and at the end of the day I said well you fucking subpoena me then you know that's all okay then I will we don't talk for four months he isn't subpoena me I look around and I see Adam Schiff wavering on television he's not going anywhere and I'm thinking you know what maybe I can't help I'm feeling bad now like no I have this one document I know will help and this other one maybe it will help so I said I send him a text which I you have copies of I said look I'm really sorry maybe we can work something else out the thing is I'm dealing with the FBI I'm helping them and I think it would be better if you subpoenaed me because that way I can tell the FBI I had no choice and there are these two documents you're going to need one is the breach report and another one was this other thing I can't really quite remember right now but again it's in your text and that says Val yeah it sounds like a great idea let's do that okay and then I was subpoena the next following Monday immediately and then I said thank you and I gave him everything I could and I said the FBI guys they subpoenaed me so I'm sorry there's nothing I can do about it and so I gave it to him and that's how it worked and then I showed you that story I told you and you did nothing you didn't take anything back you didn't write anything you did nothing I'm sorry he did subpoena you the way you frame it in the story is not can I start understanding you correctly you're upset with me because I didn't include something that you deliberately you didn't do your homework you didn't do your fucking homework you didn't do your research you didn't talk to them you didn't get the truth if you had told them dad he's not going to lie to you you know dad he's a douchebag dick but he's the truth he's an honest guy and he's respectable he's respected for his honesty and his prashness and he would tell you the truth and you had to ask him but you didn't or maybe he did but left it out just to be 100% clear and I know this I know this but just so the camera knows it too you could have provided that to me in real time as I was writing the article before the article ran and you chose for whatever reason not to you agree with that I mean that's a that's a good way that's a good way about David's friends things that's a good example I'm glad we got that on camera that's a good example how you do this here it's a little nasty to say that because oh you knew I was writing after people blah blah blah well this article has been edited for so long so suddenly you ever check if he did it for your narrative or maybe he did but left it out wait I don't know just to be 100% clear and I know this I know this but just so the camera knows it too you could have provided that to me in real time as I was writing the article before the article ran and you chose for whatever reason not to you agree with that I mean that's a that's a good way about David's friends things that's a good example I'm glad we got that on camera that's a good example how you do this here it's a little nasty to say that because oh you knew I was writing after people blah blah blah well this article has been awaited for so long so suddenly a year and a half you let me on for a year and a half and what I wanted to say every three months it's going to happen next month next month it's going to change your life but the point was that as a response to your anger was like look I got a letter from these people and I believe them right and not you after five years right after I never lied to you and you heard the text I mean the voice mail yeah I thought you didn't have the truth right there you told a different story can I say the word lie is that extreme can I say the word lie is that applicable here can I say David's lie I think that it just shows a trait of character and choices and it's just very concerning irresponsible yeah it's concerning yeah well you guys listen and there's more David no no excuse me please calm down David listen David remember when you met with them in New York remember sorry they came out to meet you in New York goldman and global remember this meeting all I'm going to say about I'm going to say one thing about them I'll just say up front the one thing I'm going to say about that meeting other than that it did happen is that they asked from my opinion on you and they gave me specific authorization they put that part on the record your credibility and if you had good stuff so that's do you remember how pissed off you got after reading that that phone call because I said what did I say I said what the fuck are two lawyers from Washington coming up and inquiring about a source a New York Times writer giving up his source why are they coming up there and why are you talking about me to them I was livid about it and then you reacted like I was the asshole for bringing it up because that looks really bad lawyers coming up from DC to New York to talk to a writer to inquire about his source that's not really the way I would characterize okay well you clearly thought I was fucked up that's quite clear is anyone else think that's fucked up is this normal behavior there's it because I'm accusing him of giving up his source lawyers in Washington me the two lawyers Dan Noble and Dan Goldman come up from Washington DC and they ask about me they inquire about your source and he told them all about me and he said to them that Vau was difficult so it was difficult all that shit and he asked Dan Goldman what he said and then he said it was difficult you think Dan Goldman will tell me the truth really I think he will well he's gonna spin it he writes down the truth we have it though we have it though okay I'll send you the recording that's another big favor but this is a big one because you can get fired for that why is that sitting downstairs or is the editor in chief advice hey editor in chief advice is that fucked up you asshole bringing me in he's not gonna say anything but he's giving me the truth but he needs to fuck up David you burned me slanted me you fucked me over you left me out to dry you did whatever you could to get ahead in your world you used the fuck out of me you used my father's emails you used me you could and you ran with it and there were consequences to those actions Tammy may not be fighting back like I am Lauren whatever her name is probably not and poor Tom Hayes he's in fucking jail dude 14 years of jail he's not gonna fight back and he's autistic too and that was kind of an easy target wasn't it you know about just I am a grieving son my father killed himself I got a screw loose I'm sure I've got my own problems yes I enjoyed oxycodone okay yes I enjoy drugs and I like to party I like to have fun and sometimes I think I'm funny enough whatever but you took advantage of me too you did sorry for that one I'm sure you're so sorry I feel that way I love that non-apology apology I've already given a full-throated apology for what I am actually saying fuck your apology and listen here are consequences to your actions apologies words don't mean shit actions mean things my father how many times have I told you what my father told me how many times it doesn't matter what people say you want to know you stand with someone you look at what they do don't even fucking listen to their words do you remember that how many times I told you you told me that a lot of times so right that's what I'm going by right now and look what you've done which is what you said and the problem is your words they have a platform okay they have a huge powerful platform a terribly fucking sword that you yield and you care less of it and not just with me but with other people care less of it and you don't give a fuck about that you only care about your next project and what you're going to get and what you can take from me and what you took from me I don't think I'm going to get that no so what do I do do I do the forward in my life and forget all about it you know my style you know me a little bit you know me a little bit you know my style I would say that isn't your style you'd be correct now I feel like let's take a break I'm ready I'm ready what else do you have to say what do you think what do I think why did you come what do you think what you're going to get out and what you can take from me and what you took from me I don't think I'm going to get that so what do I do do I do the forward in my life what are you planning on doing what do you mean be transparent what are you going to do I need to organize this in my head you don't know me yet that's what I'm asking you think I'm using this in some sort of thing I'm asking you I'm telling you we just need it for it so I know what the fuck I said so if I'm attacked I can remember what the fuck I said and I can remember what the fuck he said sometimes in my head I mix things up well there's a lot of shit I don't know if David said like the word for example I fucked up with the word extort like I was sure it was in his article but it turns out the word extort was in Dan Goldman's press release fuck that one up the word that he used demanding money demanding money something similar to that but anyway I just want to know this for my my own stuff and we like to I like to listen to the recordings to figure out what the fuck cause I get caught up in the moment I don't remember it all I don't understand some of the stuff in the context talking about it without a reference here it would have been kind of impossible I know yeah so I'm trying to give you that too at the same time and I'm going to send you the article yeah we're sending all this stuff and we're going to send him the recording to Dan Goldman cause I have a decision to make I think I definitely will go talk to David if he'll let me at the time's office because there's certainly a lot of stuff that like I don't have a checklist of stuff that we will go through that needs to be fact checked and like you said people get everything with the questions well there's gotta be like 10 that's pretty easy is that my style you know me a little bit I do know you a little bit is that my style I would say that you'd be correct good well let now I feel like let's take a break do you want some water I'm fine I'm ready but if you want to take a break can I get some water you want to yell David you can yell David I'll give you some what else do you have to say what do you think Dan it doesn't matter what do I think why did you come in what do you think I'm good thank you you guys do you want some water do you want some water I know how thank you let's really talk I don't have information from this guy well you can I think we can cut around with you I'm gonna ask so you have more to say the reason we came out here you were gonna want to rip into me a little bit and obviously that is your prerogative so you have a massacist no Val because honestly now it's not a massacist it's a sense that you have a great story and I want to share your story with as many people as possible and there's no better way to do that than hearing it straight out of your mouth and this is your opportunity to do that so if you want to move my opportunity do you have the way you frame it to my opportunity to do that with you you're giving me such a big value to me in this opportunity it's not me do you see how I could pick that up as offensive not really honestly but yes I understand I'm not trying to be offensive about I'm just honestly trying to if you would like to tell your story the place I would like to start is offering you I would just like to hear you talk about your dad a little bit and tell us who was Bill Brooksman we'll get there baby we'll get there now right now I'm a little upset with you and I need to air this grievance with you it's very important for me I can tell why you wanted me to talk about your father I'm very curious about your intentions I'm thinking why is he coming do you mind if I just cut that this was a story that David didn't pitch it to us or anything I found I was really intrigued by the more I read about your story we tell stories about the news yours is a perfect example of that you have an incredible story that we're able to tell and people understand what's happening in the news and so that's my goal here is to get the story from your mouth the more that we get from you of your own story the less that we have to rely on David to tell it I like the sound of that Marlo please Marie please that's a great I can't even hear sorry Eric just to give you an idea we're interested in starting from your childhood learning more about your relationship with your dad and hearing about your quest to get some understanding about this thing to have it in your life David's here David as the reporter who's done most of the reporting until this point so with you writing the profile so what did you think of you didn't even know about me yeah I mean I was intrigued by your story I just thought it was compelling knowing how writers write and how this industry works in the New York Times as you read the story you're like oh this is a bit on the negative side right I had the same thing I don't know if I feel comfortable making that judgment let's pretend this is the answer okay so let's say I felt this is a little negative maybe it's a bit more one sided than I thought maybe it would be good to hear the other story yeah I mean our whole goal is for your voice to be if that's the truth to me yes I would be happy yeah yeah I mean it absolutely is I can tell you that 100% okay so with David you know I don't I'm just a bit upset yeah I'm totally upset and I feel used and it felt like I was I feel like I was fucking betrayed when he was there you know I called you a friend and I will never do that again so no I don't need you to be my friend well we're not friends you're you're not a journalist I can't count the number of times I've said that to you okay and I can't count the number of times you said oh I'm gonna see you a friend this is what friends do fuck's sake David oh my god I know so many other people it's just your I mean I know you're on the spot and it's tough and you're being attacked and your defenses are up I get that and I'm taking advantage of that too I'm sure you know this this is a part of my revenge okay this is a small part of my revenge but I am upset and it's very hard for me to talk about something dear to me this is my father what I feel like this person is going to sabotage take it from me rip it and abuse it and pervert it in some way you know I know that now since it's on the record there's no way he's going to be able to get away with it but I still don't feel safety I felt before you know generally I love talking about my father you know but now right now I think maybe we should maybe save it for tomorrow I mean if that's two or three hours later I can't we just need to save some time of course we have two days that's why we wanted to take advantage of that so I mean if you feel like we can be better like the air is more clear for tomorrow yeah just some time prior when we breathe that more goes to the corners have the coaches have the water in their faces and so we come out without guns yeah I mean so do you feel like you've said what you needed to say today Ray what do you think do you remember is there anything else you wanted to say I have this much on but I don't know no no because you're just affected just as much as I was remember it wasn't just me that got screwed over here in fact it was a lot of people so Marie do you have anything to say please no I just I mean to me it's just as I said I've known both of them the same teacher I just want to say I need to talk to his father actually use this against me very very intensely on his favor of course and I will not hear the end of it every time I have him on the phone or I see him or you see him it's another set of humiliation I've had people come up to me saying our children are friends but I think it's best we start being friends so I had a lot of friends in LA I don't have them anymore I mean this guy is a bad guy I mean this is another person I know and I was saying that I mean I think even Allah would not believe it like she would not believe it Allah is the only Oh sorry and that's to me it's like I'm kind of a pessimist and he's an eternal optimist and it's very charming but I was always careful and just you know I don't say everything way to day and these and that I would always tell her I trust David please trust me that I trust him you know me he's okay I said over and over to her and everybody met you were like the greatest I was crying and if somebody had something bad several times but David anything that had to do with you and like like his life and to him you guys were working together I know it's your book and he's not a writer we talk every day for like two and a half years you gave him so many answers so many information and in the book it's like lovely little acknowledgement I mean come on wait sorry I didn't press the last one you acknowledge him but oh yes it does relationship very nice I do think it's great he changed the I read it I read it wait hang on you haven't seen a draft of us oh I've seen how's that I don't know I mean I just I there's did you really think I wasn't going to get a copy of the book you know did you really think I would let this slide I think the book reflects really well on you though and it I think I don't know if you've read it I've told you I've read it around to him I read it myself then I read it around because it was too painful for him to read it so yeah I can imagine these are like really painful events for you it wasn't that it was you you can still see it in the book like what like what in the book I know I'm a meandering sort of idiotic asshole that you're hopeless these were hopeless and I had to go down all the time careless with people and really I was mean to my mother yeah for for Allah yes it's terrible you couldn't stop yourself then sending me money to him he doesn't do anything he couldn't handle the money anyway I'm not sure how my guess is you got a hold of a book a version of the book that was sent to and Roxanne probably no no yes you do so that's what it doesn't make sense that's the secret but you get what I'm saying it doesn't make sense with how he's claiming you never said that to Odessa Odessa's saying she didn't say that but she leaked your book oh yeah she has no clue well then you know what there you go I'm just saying the fact that she had the book I didn't tell you I understand I understand actually his moral made him hesitate until the very very last minute because he was I mean even last night I had an argument with you is he still defending you yeah I can't believe I caught myself defending I said you were right you were right it was like instinct to just defend it I said no David it wasn't well from whatever it was the guys the people who don't have a stake in this one were the other and I very much do have a stake in it obviously you guys do too who don't know you who don't really know me and have read it think that they have a very different read on every time I see a review I don't see my name I don't see my father's name I see a blurb that says David's exposing Deutsche Bank stay tuned for more Deutsche Bank and more terrible things and I'm supposed to be the main character right you're a main character you're a dad or probably the main character that was a mention of us and why am I not on the back of the book where's the description if I am such a main character tell me about it the banker's son was not the original title that was the title I started with but that was what I got regret telling you that about me because I told you at the time that that was definitely something that we were toying with that might not happen but I'm just looking at actually the back of the book where it's described as father-son drama it's it's very much about you and about your father I don't think anyone is my name in there we're on the back of the book we're just there with the index we're just a main character but usually they would be in the description so this is what the book's about we had an agreement did we not that the book was going to be about my father and my journey mostly over the course of the last five years of what I've discovered through my eyes that's definitely the bulk of the book that's also what you pitched in New York Times because you sent me the what the pitch that you sent in New York Times and you sent me the pitch that you sent to our colleagues and both of them said okay that the book was about me and my father and the journey that I've been through and I told you back through my eyes okay that is not what I read well that is a very different book I'm not sure what you read Val but the I look let's just let the book speak for itself then because I don't think any person who reads that book will possibly come away with agreements except for the fact that you are not by name you ignore your dad I believe it's prominently mentioned by name on the jacket of the book right and if the tables return we should be a bit upset honestly if I was just in this to have my dad's legacy every time you say I'm on the side of the word honestly if I was just concerned about my dad's legacy and I read this book I think I would be pretty pretty content with it and what did I say earlier on I said you did a good job with my father and respected him and I was appreciated so let's not lose sight of him no I didn't lose sight of him but me it's another story I do have to defend myself too and I talk all over and I refuse to and I'm not going to let it happen and this whole thing right here who is this benefit who is this benefit wait one way please who is this benefit what's this the day the podcast who does it benefit does it benefit me or you you have a book to sell it doesn't matter it's not the same days your book it's coming out but this benefit too what does what mean why do they do this then they can't say that they're promoting the book they can't say it benefits one of the writers but he said this is not coming out around the release of the book he's lying it's an obvious lie it's a weird lie because everyone knows it's not if he said mid-march though I'm saying that the release date the book is released February 18th that's very soon I know because I think they are going to be in mid-march so I'm wondering if he has another story yeah but imagine you have a book coming out in February then you have a relance a rebound of promotion I get that part but I've never seen the Times do that without something in tandem in the paper and I've checked and that's every episode of the Daily has like a unless it's like a political rally or something yes the last time you did it with a different podcast there was the story about the Hitch Bank and I was commemorating and he promoted the book we didn't say anything about us so he already did one right okay so maybe you're right about the rebound then yes of course I just feel like he's going to have another story it's possible we'll see he'll just copy and paste from the book he's going to do the same though he's going to do like the first one what are you talking about first person, immersive I apologize that would be fantastic it's going to be the same month as my book this benefits you David this helps your books arguing, it's fun readers will listen and they'll say oh my god Foul's an asshole or David's an asshole whatever but the fact is they're talking about it and they're like oh let's see about this book maybe we can find out more alright so maybe the book isn't good enough or interesting enough and so maybe you need this little fiasco to help some bookstores who knows I'm just I'm not saying it's true I'm just spitballing here maybe this is going to benefit you in that way maybe you said let's go out to California and have Foul yell at me because this can be critical to see maybe no you mean this yes maybe I can get Foul again you know put him in his place I mean Foul's a no good dude is it idiotic drug addict asshole I mean whatever the fuck you've said about me you probably didn't do any research or doesn't care he's probably going to wake up to you he's always David coming today I forgot all about it and then you can do whatever the fuck you want I predicted there's going to be a camera failure he didn't he said 10% you're right that's true I predicted there'd be a camera failure I said no he didn't he said there'd be a 10% chance because you're right I did it's good if you got him I said do you want to know how I describe you to strongest man I was like were you talking about it he's like yeah we were because the daily always does that stuff we're in the car we're arriving at the Vogue Schmidt's house like I asked him if we did that and he's like yeah yeah we did that so I know that I know they're going to include it but they kind of have to include me asking them too if they're going to talk about the film crew you know like so I hope they give me some promotion that's why you need to look intelligent, articulate charismatic and charming where is that in the profile why is that not in the profile I get to think that some of those words feel like are in the profile it's not not one compliment or nice everything a pejority we went through friends with every single fucking word you wrote you didn't say one time I don't think that's true did you read what we sent you we went through it word for word can you show me one nice word can you show me one time Dini said if you just told him I'm sure I can okay do it I don't have internet I'm not walking to your house ladies and gentlemen of the world the wifi password here is Olive Airplane 370 I'm not allowed to have your wifi thanks that's the smartest thing you said on that you want to have the air flow on your device I'm happy I'm happy I'm happy I just realized that was good now you have the Russians you have the Russians don't you I'm happy he probably he probably completely didn't do any research or doesn't care he's probably going to wake up and tell you it's Dave you're coming today I forgot all about it and then you can do whatever the fuck you want I predicted there's going to be a camera for you you're right that's true do you want to know how I describe you to strangers intelligent, articulate charismatic and charming why is that not in the profile I usually think that some of those words are in the profile it's not not one compliment or nice everything of the choreo we went through friends of the every single fucking word you wrote I don't think that's true did you read what we sent you we went through it word for word can you show me one nice word can you show me one thing you said I'm sure I can I don't have internet you don't have internet ladies and gentlemen of the world the wifi password here is oliveairplane370 I'm not allowed to have your wifi thanks that's the smartest thing you said on that you learned the article on your on your device I'm happy I'm happy see that's funny it's only funny when it's on camera what were you saying there's tennis in this picture you say you describe this these time words this is how you describe me that's not how you describe it to the world maybe in private you say this this is the world this isn't just Ricky Dinky's spot in Swaziland like I said before or even a regional paper or just America this is the world billions of people and you're careless you fucked up and you will pay the consequences of that whatever that looks like you know and I'm angry obviously so I would love to talk about my father but I can't do it we should come back tomorrow do you think there's a little earlier we can do like noon maybe 11 let's try for 11 I don't have to do it 11 so there's I could do that's probably the best yeah we don't want to take up your whole day we don't want to try to are you taking up more than a day well Eric hasn't done anything no it's taking up five years of my life well actually David's only taken up two and a half but yes I think I can do another day okay so let's find for noon tomorrow okay I mean do you have any questions for me that you want to I didn't really do any background I mean just about what we want from you or what the hopes for the story are basically we we generally don't show people our list of questions but the thrust of the story is your childhood your relationship to your dad how you came to understand his role at Deutsche Bank when you were young obviously when you were talking about your suicide you discovering that and then basically the thrust of the episode is you trying to figure out or trying to get a satisfactory answer a satisfactory as you can for why he killed himself and then along the way we're learning things about Deutsche Bank and about things that are in the news do you have that certain in you sure okay this makes sense okay this makes sense because he says they have breaking news so this will be you'll be one of many characters that are around the book but it will probably be a second wave what do you say? there'll be a breaking news that somehow this podcast fits around where do you get that from? because he says your breaking news is short what does he say? I ask him do you want some breaking news as well? yeah sure I think you may but also before you hit play why don't you get Scott some breaking news tomorrow? well before any news breaks the reason what we said to him you think all of us at the Georgia we didn't say one nice thing which is true we went through it word by word and then I said didn't you get what we sent you because you probably don't understand what that is so we went through it word by word and we wrote everything out like what is mischaracterization what is accurate and what's inaccurate and we sent it to him and to Nick Summers and his editor and other women which I guess is on another the one you didn't bring the part you didn't bring it must be all in there and when we talked about her yeah I remember that so we'll give that to you too if you want it and how much time before they came did you send to a week? right after the article not to the daily though you sent it to and as a people I thought you were sending it to the producer before he came no no no David is not that for three months after the article was published in your times we went through it and we sent it to David and his editors yeah and that's when you had the call about like oh technically yes yes yes okay I understand we're trying to get a satisfactory answer as satisfactory as you can for why he killed himself and then you know along the way we're learning things about Deutsche Bank and about things that are in the news do you have that statement? sure I don't know but I'll give it to you can I say anything to finish? I'm sorry I've interjected too many times and stopped myself many times we've had many conversations many and you put me one time in the book I'm only in three pages in the book and the only quote I've decided to use is a negative quote which I don't even think I've said I know exactly what you're talking about and of all the things I've told you about that's what you've decided to put everything the first day I met you at that cafe in New York beautiful things about him and our meeting and everything and at that time some red flags really came to my head because you said well you're the first person that has so many positive things to say about and I was like oh that's odd first of all why would you say that to me? if it was true why would you say that to a woman that is telling you about that and she's enamored I mean that's disturbing and over the last two years I've told you so many good things about him and you've only chosen one sentence that says nothing about our relationship or about who he is and I've given you some insight about him and his personality I think you have Marie a lot of our conversations have been off the record no that's not true really? are you saying our conversations have all been on the record? when was the last time we spoke? I had not your email after mine it's like obviously we've been chatting and obviously you putting all the negative things in there that makes you also Marie if you want our conversations to all be on the record that's fine but they're not right now and you should just is that why you decided of all the conversations we've had you've decided to use a quote that is negative about how? I don't think the quote was negative about that what was the quote? something to be effective right when you first met he sleeps all day is depressed I thought the quote you were referring to is he thought that sleeping with his mom's best friend was a good way to get back at her you told me that that's another bullshit you told me that I read the book that's in the book no it's in the first part of the epilogue I read the book you're referring to this well the book hasn't been David we went through the different versions you added just a few paragraphs it's exactly the same copy I have in the epilogue I'm in the epilogue in three pages and one quote that you use for me and that you know with what it's by me is the negative one I think it's all good she's saying she feels like you I understand what you're saying you just represented her my feelings please you picked only negative things to further your agenda of feigning a negative fortune is what she's trying to do I shared my feelings for you and you didn't use them I mean there's only one sentence I think it is clear when you're living with someone and you're in a serious relationship with them that you love them no it's not yes it is and you don't show I don't so it's you're saying the reader who can read between the lines when the only quote I have is a negative one but she really loves him I'll let the book speak for itself I think that based on the feedback I've gotten so far from people who don't know you they think frankly I haven't asked about you but they think that you come off pretty well you're complicated and you're flawed the way you are but they think you come off pretty well and if you've actually read the book that's being published as opposed to whatever you've looked at in the past exact same book well I don't know, I can't answer that you don't even need to, it doesn't really matter to me there's the version of the book that is being published which all I can say is I stand by it I'm proud of it and I think it reflects you you're a protagonist along with your father you're probably the main protagonists and I'm proud of it but it wouldn't have happened without you I'm really really grateful for the work you provided for to help you provide it and yeah and it honestly it pains me to this is not a pleasant afternoon for me I was just not intended to be it already it pains me to know the anger and grief that you guys are feeling toward me and this afternoon not toward you that you have caused you did it you caused this you were careless, you caused this okay these are the consequences part of the consequences it affects other people it affects me of course and then it ricochets and it affects Marie child's life and I feel awful about that okay well mission accomplished do something about it no there's nothing look guys I am part of what we're doing here is the solution to this we want you in your own words to essentially tell your story it's a compelling story it's a story that I think belongs fully unfiltered out in the open for the public and we very much want that that's something that service the daily can provide with your help that's we're not coming in here with any tricks of our sleeves and we're eager to hear your story in your own words and that's what we're trying to say at the outset before we started all this we want you to be we want this in your voice so let's try to say those words are you you've only interviewed him for two years I've been interviewing him for six years or whatever okay alright you guys thank you okay so what's the plan 12 o'clock tomorrow okay alright you're actually right can you guys can you guys ask him ask him ask him as long as we're still rolling I'm not gonna oh no there's more I'm sure there's another car there what is the question like 50 minutes to just transfer that I got what I could man what was my question another one another one is these are other ones that were on there what did I ask I don't remember do you remember what she asked I don't if you if you base your book on fraud I have a life the most important part is when he's downstairs oh right I don't have the downstairs part wait let me see that the recording was upstairs the recording was upstairs thank you I gotta go meet someone can you give me that no it's a 50 gigabyte file any of the shit so starting the late nights I gotta go it doesn't sound like you have to anyway it's been I appreciate you guys thank you thank you so much I'll send you an audio I love that thanks that was it I gotta go man drink the booze in here no I'm not bringing the fucking booze in here no I gotta keep my life separate from this shit man we can have fun I leave Wednesday I got some shit to do okay go I did what I could we were gonna go out with you I'll see you tomorrow believe me we'll be here tomorrow what time are you coming 10 thank you what time 10 30 okay but you know I got a lot of clarification from this I wanna talk about it tomorrow cause now I know what to ask cause it's too overwhelming to know what to ask a dispute because now I have to go to David and I'll make the same deal with David if he wants to watch over that footage cause I mean they have the audio but you know what I'm saying I think it's only fair because that's how I wanna question him too two or three things that of my you know of the way I'm looking at this story and again what I think you need to what I'm focused on what I'm gonna keep asking you and him is about these fraudulent pink ones because Tom Bowers um and
