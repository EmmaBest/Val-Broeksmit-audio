1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
He shows you the tactics of what David tries to do, but he doesn't have the patience to do, because he picks topics that take four years to cover, and that's just, you're gonna fuck up, okay?

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,640
Unless you're like, you know, like Psy Hirsch, or something like that, right?

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,140
Psy Hirsch, he's not in that job.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,980
Oh, he's great, you see? You have to have such discipline.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,980
Oh, he doesn't have that discipline.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,980
Okay.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,480
Oh, you're saying you have that discipline?

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,820
No, I'm saying Psy Hirsch has that discipline.

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
To do a four-year story of this magnitude, right?

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,820
Okay.

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,820
He'll never waver.

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,820
So, David, thanks for this, I waited until 9 a.m. Tuesday, so the second thing.

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,820
David, thanks again for letting us film your interview with Valon Company.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,820
Hats off to you for figuring so much of this out and framing a deeply human narrative around it.

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm very much looking forward to, I'm basically saying I can play the Times game, too.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,820
Right, right.

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Fucking, you know, Page Boy.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
Like, I am very much looking forward to fully digging the book.

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,820
I want to recognize you.

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Oh, to fully digging the book.

22
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Oh, okay.

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,820
I want to reiterate that I'll be, oh, I almost, I almost, when he was asking where the page

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,820
was, I was trying to find it.

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,820
And I was going to be like, hey, it's game 156.

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,820
I thought I heard you say, you almost, I think you did say that.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,820
No, I didn't.

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I think I thought I heard you say that.

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,820
I thought you didn't say it.

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
Someone, like, downstairs, you were saying, hey, who's got a copy?

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,820
I was like, yeah.

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,820
Then I shut up, yeah.

33
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,820
You didn't hear that.

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,820
I want to reiterate that I'll be fastidious in what makes the final cut and that will only

35
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,820
be the facts.

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,820
We will fact check, but this is much more of a portrait than an investigative piece.

37
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,820
So checking those facts shouldn't be overly burdensome for anyone involved, as we won't

38
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,320
be looking to break anything new, which is unless something new breaks, or focus on any

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,820
areas of dispute other than what we get on camera.

40
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,820
Your relationship with Val is one of many we explore with this piece.

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,820
We will continue to challenge him on his version of events and his actions.

42
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
I'll see you in a few hours.

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
But I also wanted to check to see if you're still open to a solo interview following the

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,820
daily taping.

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,820
We could do it immediately afterward, or later this afternoon's last evening.

46
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
We can work around your schedule.

47
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
All my best, Rocco.

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Now, remember, he writes me back.

49
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Let's see.

50
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,820
Within...

51
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
One minute?

52
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
No, not one minute.

53
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Within 15, within 14 minutes.

54
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,820
Very fast.

55
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,820
Thanks, Rocco.

56
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,820
I appreciate your note.

57
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,820
I'm happy to sit for an interview, but let's see how and how long things go today.

58
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
It might be more sense to do it back in New York.

59
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
I also should check with NYTPR people.

60
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Val made some pretty damaging allegations about me on camera yesterday.

61
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,820
He said that I had told a deseret that I would basically pay off Val.

62
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
He's only concerned with his business.

63
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Pay off Val so that I could get a solo interview.

64
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Right.

65
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,820
His business.

66
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,820
And he said that two of my sources, Tom Hayes and Tamiq Fad and both have expressed displeasure

67
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
with how I've handled their stories and relationships.

68
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,820
Nothing about this is the story writing of me.

69
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
The thing about their stories.

70
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,820
I checked with all three of them.

71
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
They did not, having said this to Val.

72
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,820
In the cases of Tom and Tami, they did not, having ever spoken to Val.

73
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,820
I'm attaching screenshots of their denial so you can see for yourself.

74
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I'm not planning to raise this with Val today because I don't want to escalate things unnecessarily.

75
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,820
But I hope you will treat this as a clear warning that Val not only is seeking revenge against me.

76
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
That's his word.

77
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
But he is spreading false information.

78
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Please tread carefully.

79
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
If you are considering Arion and Val's allegations, please let me know.

80
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
And I can give you contact in for Tami, Tami, Tom, and Odessa.

81
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
But then he sends me these texts, right?

82
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
And one of them he asks for permission.

83
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
One of them he asks.

84
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,820
What do you mean?

85
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,820
One of them he says.

86
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,820
And I share this with the producer.

87
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,820
Oh, you see it.

88
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,820
To whom?

89
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Oh, he sees the screenshots.

90
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,820
Which is interesting.

91
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
Yeah, this is not kosher.

92
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
This is actually wire fraud.

93
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,820
No, I understand.

94
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,820
Pretty sure it is.

95
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,820
Because he's two-party consent.

96
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Yes!

97
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
He's sharing screenshots of other people.

98
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,820
That's right.

99
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
And then I said to him, you're in two-party consent state.

100
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
You said that?

101
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Yeah.

102
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
And he goes, you remember that California is a two-party...

103
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
And then later on he goes, oh yeah, because California is a two-party consent state.

104
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Like, I'm basically telling him.

105
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,820
No one's ever done it.

106
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
No one's ever challenged.

107
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Like you said, no one really comes after you just with a will.

108
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,820
But in the times, parlance, if you make a reporter look like a fucking idiot,

109
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
they're sending you.

110
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
But he thinks because I'm a reporter.

111
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
But then he goes and says to show it to you.

112
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
The dude who's fucking leaking on.

113
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Right, right, right.

114
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Okay?

115
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
So that's just chuckle head city.

116
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,820
That's funny.

117
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,820
So Isha's...

118
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
That's what you were doing with that day when you came and showed us, yeah.

119
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,820
You get it?

120
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,820
Yeah.

121
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,820
That's when you said I've got some news.

122
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Yeah, yeah.

123
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
And I didn't want to do what he told me to do, right?

124
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Because then I'm just as...

125
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
He was trying to do two things.

126
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
He was trying to...

127
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
He didn't know what I was going to say the next day.

128
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,820
He thought I was like on your side or whatever the fuck.

129
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
He thought you were my crew.

130
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
He kept seeing this in the text.

131
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
And the first thing I say in the microphone.

132
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,820
I'm not Val's crew.

133
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
I want to make it really clear.

134
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Daily show, I'm not Val's crew, right?

135
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,820
Yeah, I remember.

136
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,820
I heard that.

137
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,820
So if he fucking says that on the daily, I'm going to call up their almsbudsman

138
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
and I'm going to fucking ream his ass.

139
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,820
Val's crew.

140
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
I'll shut up with his own film crew.

141
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
I'm going to call him up.

142
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I'm going to say, well, we'll talk to him.

143
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
I said, guess what?

144
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,820
You got 24 hours or I'm leaking some video that makes him look fucking horrible.

145
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,820
Which video?

146
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
The fucking M-[Redacted] or something.

147
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,820
Oh, leaking.

148
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
Like a 20 second clip that makes him look...

149
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Or when he leaves, right?

150
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,820
I don't mean come on.

151
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
And then I'm going to say...

152
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
You're leaving good, leaving good.

153
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I'm going to say, what do you want?

154
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm going to say I want a letter to the editor that I get to write her a column

155
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
about this fucking experience and then we'll really...

156
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,820
Oh man, I wanted to do that too about my experience with him.

157
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
I think they should have.

158
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
How could you do that?

159
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
How could you tell him to go about doing it?

160
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
Who did he talk to?

161
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
He fucking twist their arm to a pop set of sockets.

162
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
That's the only way to do it.

163
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,820
Because you said something.

164
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,820
You're right.

165
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,820
But it would be better if I did it because I think it's fair.

166
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
And you need to write your own book.

167
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
We've already talked about that.

168
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
I don't know how to beat that horse.

169
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
So I'm saying, you see what I did.

170
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Wait, who did you get permission from?

171
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
He got permission from, that's a good question.

172
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Because whoever you got permission from, he's actually scared of.

173
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
The rest of them, he's not scared of.

174
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,820
He's not scared of Dessa.

175
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Because remember, Dessa was the only one that wasn't on signal.

176
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Or maybe, wait, wait.

177
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
You're going to care less about Dessa.

178
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,820
Wait, and he text her at 7.52 a.m.

179
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
That morning.

180
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
That morning, it must have been.

181
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
And I don't have the time.

182
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Why would he text her that early knowing she would get back?

183
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
He's sending me signal?

184
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
No, no.

185
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
He must know that she was, because she's in Saudi Arabia.

186
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
So he knows that.

187
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Why else would he do that 7 fucking 30 in the morning?

188
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Jesus.

189
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
She'll cut you out of this quicker than you can fucking say.

190
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,820
The shopping arrangement was to tie you up while he went and got his own.

191
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,820
Wait, what?

192
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
Yeah.

193
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,820
It works.

194
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Shopping arrangement is worthless.

195
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
So time me up while he goes and gets his own thing.

196
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,820
With who?

197
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
I don't think he's gotten it yet.

198
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
No, with Adessa.

199
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Because that means Adessa is complicit.

200
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
No, Adessa can't do both, I don't think.

201
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
No, but she wanted to time me up.

202
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
No, because she could do work with David.

203
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,820
David.

204
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
But she, they spoke with her.

205
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
They spoke with David behind my back to get their own deal.

206
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,820
That's what I'm saying.

207
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
To have their own deal with David.

208
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,820
With the agent.

209
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
With the agent, right?

210
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
So the agent's the cutout, right?

211
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,820
No, with the agent.

212
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,820
No, with the agent.

213
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
The agent is the cutout.

214
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
Oh, the cutout.

215
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
Who then allows to have her hands clean, right?

216
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
But that's part of the course in Hollywood.

217
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
You can't complain about that.

218
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
The reporters you can complain about.

219
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
But that's just, you gotta be a shark.

220
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And David's not a shark.

221
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
He's a squid.

222
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
Like, you know, I see exactly what they're doing.

223
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,820
It's amateur hour.

224
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
And the agents are gonna walk away with a bunch of money.

225
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,820
That's who's gonna win.

226
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Not them.

227
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Because remember we had the problem with the agents from CAA?

228
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,820
Remember we had the agents from WMA or WM, whatever?

229
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
The agents from CAA and WME.

230
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
Yeah, go ahead.

231
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
They are as good.

232
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
They are like smart FBI agents.

233
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Right.

234
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,820
With an unlimited bank account.

235
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Who can do whatever the fuck they want.

236
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Right.

237
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Stay away from agents.

238
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Remember the guy?

239
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Yeah, no, you're right.

240
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,820
But they said, we don't want to work with Val because apparently there's some sort of vendetta at Valhouse with Andrew Durecky.

241
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
I don't want to be in the middle of it.

242
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Is that true, though?

243
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Do you have a vendetta with him?

244
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,820
No, no.

245
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,820
You just kind of falling out with him, right?

246
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
No, I wanted to get back in with him.

247
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
So I said, get Andrew a copy of this.

248
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,820
Put it on his desk.

249
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
I want Andrew to do this.

250
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
Put it on his desk.

251
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
Once he sees that it's a packed, complete copy.

252
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Yeah, but is he capable?

253
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Andrew?

254
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Oh, he's very capable.

255
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Okay.

256
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,820
It just takes forever.

257
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
That's my problem with that shit.

258
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,820
It takes way too long.

259
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
But we don't want to live in that world anymore.

260
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
I know, I know.

261
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
We did when the Jinx came out.

262
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Yeah.

263
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Is it slow?

264
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,820
It's slow.

265
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,820
What the fuck happened here?

266
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Where?

267
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
Data needs.

268
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
I don't know what that means.

269
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
Wait, so who got permission?

270
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
Tom.

271
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
I think it was Tom.

272
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Tom.

273
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Tom.

274
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,820
I'll check, but I'm almost positive.

275
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
But as you said, he only cared about him.

276
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
And Tom gave him shit.

277
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Yeah, he did.

278
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
Tom gave him shit.

279
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,820
I wish I could see the numbers in these.

280
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
But he said to give them to me.

281
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
Yeah.

282
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,820
But the problem is, if I give them to you, again, it puts me, he's trying to trap me into a situation

283
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
where I do something like that, or he can discredit me.

284
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Well, you decide camera.

285
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,820
What?

286
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
You showed it to me.

287
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
I showed it to you.

288
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
On camera?

289
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,820
But if I were to go and get the numbers, that he wouldn't give you, if I went and got the

291
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
numbers from him.

292
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,820
What numbers?

293
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
He gets up for you.

294
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Oh, they're phone numbers.

295
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
Yeah.

296
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
And then I gave them to you.

297
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Oh, yeah, yeah.

298
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,820
And he's held them off from you for so long, he's going to say, well, Rocco leaked it.

299
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
And that way, the circle's complete.

300
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
You know who really wanted the numbers?

301
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
FBI.

302
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
They called me and asked me for...

303
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Why can't they get the fucking numbers?

304
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
You kidding me?

305
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
I don't get that.

306
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
They asked me for Tammy's number.

307
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Well, no wonder the Trump's taking the shit on the FBI.

308
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
They're fucking stupid.

309
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
They can't find a number?

310
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
I found Tammy's in the fucking number.

311
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
I don't know if it's right.

312
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,820
I've been calling her.

313
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
They wanted, I guess they wanted an easy route.

314
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Number?

315
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
They wanted an easy route.

316
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
They said, can you get me Tammy's number?

317
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
They wanted to see if you knew their numbers.

318
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,820
No, they said, I said, I don't know the numbers.

319
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,820
I said, but David obviously knows, as you know.

320
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,820
So I will ask David.

321
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,820
Do you see if you knew the numbers?

322
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
No.

323
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
I said, no, no, no.

324
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Just listen.

325
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Let me finish.

326
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Sorry.

327
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
I said, I will ask David.

328
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
I said, David, I kind of need the number for Tammy.

329
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
He said, why?

330
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Well, you told him why.

331
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
No, I didn't.

332
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
I never told him why.

333
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
No, I didn't.

334
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
I said, well, look, there's this whole thing, blah, blah, blah, blah.

335
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,820
And you know, I got a whistleblower friend at Deutsche Bank and he's interested in knowing

336
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
if you can cross-reference some of his data with the data of Tammy's.

337
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,820
He goes, well, you know, okay, if I can't give you her number, but you know what?

338
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
I can give you the lawyer's number.

339
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Here's the lawyer's number.

340
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
That's it.

341
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
So I said, I went back to the FBI.

342
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
I said, FBI, I'm sorry, this is the best I could do.

343
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:09,820
And to be fair to David or anybody, you can't operate as an extension of law enforcement.

344
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,820
That's the worst thing a journalist could ever do, because you'll never gain your credibility back.

345
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Right.

346
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
And that's what it is.

347
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
And in that instance, that's what it is.

348
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
No, but you got worse.

349
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,820
What happened was, because I didn't even get the number, one of the FBI agents called

350
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,820
up, called up the lawyer, sorry, called up the David Enrich directly.

351
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,820
How did they get the number from me and said, hey, we would like Tammy's number.

352
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,820
And then everyone in the fucking New York Times flipped out, flipped the fuck out.

353
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
And then that's why they included the FBI in the story.

354
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
So the FBI called us looking for him.

355
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,820
And then they said, basically, he called the, the FBI ended up calling the lawyer.

356
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
David calls me and says, oh my God, you never even guess what just happened.

357
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
It's the craziest thing in the world.

358
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
You know that guy that the FBI you're working with?

359
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
He just called me.

360
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
I'm like, no.

361
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
It was funny.

362
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
I couldn't believe it.

363
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
When you told the story tomorrow, that's what you told me.

364
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,820
No, and then, no, but that's because then the next day, the FBI, I called them and was

365
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,820
like, dude, what are you doing, you guys?

366
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,820
I could have gotten your number just like waited around a little longer.

367
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Why did you call David?

368
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,820
Because now you're going to be in the story and I'm in the story, right?

369
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
Because I'm the one with the connection here.

370
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
And the guy's about, he apologized, but I'm so sorry.

371
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
We fucked up.

372
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
No, it's funny, it really is.

373
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
He said, I'm so sorry.

374
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Fuck that.

375
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
We shouldn't have done that.

376
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,820
We shouldn't have done that.

377
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
We should have just let you do it.

378
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
I'm so sorry.

379
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
I just couldn't wait any longer.

380
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
I wanted to try and get it myself.

381
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Why the fuck is the FBI so interested in these people?

382
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
In this story, in this particular?

383
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
They're not.

384
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
They're interested in the Starz reports.

385
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
And that's when you...

386
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Because David had no documentation.

387
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
That's why I kept bringing that shit up.

388
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,820
He did have documentation.

389
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
No, he didn't.

390
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
He has nothing.

391
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
He doesn't.

392
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
What is he doing?

393
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
He's calling down.

394
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
He's just the fucking word of his word and Tammy's word.

395
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
And they think that's enough to have a story.

396
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
It is for a book, unfortunately.

397
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,820
What?

398
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,820
It's for a book.

399
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,820
It is enough to sell the book.

400
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
No, but it was the article that...

401
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,820
No, you're right, you're right.

402
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Read the article with Tammy.

403
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
There's nothing.

404
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,820
You're right.

405
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
No one saw it.

406
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,820
No one has it.

407
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Tammy supposedly saw it.

408
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
That's why they questioned if she was credible or not.

409
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Yes.

410
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,820
Do you think she's credible?

411
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Yes, she's credible.

412
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
I think she's credible, too.

413
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,820
But I think David is when it's not credible.

414
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,820
He's the one that's writing this up in his spin without any documentation or anything.

415
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Because he got so deep in that there was no way out.

416
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
Yeah, when he got all the way down there, he was really excited and he came up back with

417
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
nothing.

418
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
No reports.

419
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Long paper work.

420
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Long paper work.

421
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
David, David, he's got it.

422
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
He's got something.

423
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
It's fraudulent.

424
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
I'm going to press him on it.

425
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Press him?

426
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
Fucking hard.

427
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
I'm going to say, we're talking about this a lot.

428
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,820
We're talking about this a lot.

429
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Because it's all I care about.

430
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,820
That's where dispute, when I put the pen in it, that's exactly where dispute is.

431
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
And all the rest of the shit's noise.

432
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Where are the fucking lenders?

433
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
I'm trying to get them in.

434
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
I know.

435
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I don't think we're going to get them, right?

436
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
I'm going to try.

437
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,820
But if they're fraudulent, it's just as important and weird as if they're real, right?

438
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
But we don't know if it's really fraudulent because only Deutsche Bank has said they're fraudulent.

439
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
Only Deutsche Bank has said that.

440
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
That's what I'm saying.

441
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,820
But they could be fraudulent because the Russians signed off-room with dead money that isn't

442
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,820
real money and not real fucking lenders because they don't have the right to lend through

443
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Deutsche Bank.

444
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I'm going to bring up a good point, but what is fraudulent to them?

445
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
What is they saying is fraudulent?

446
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Because in my head, fraudulent, in everyone's head means, oh, someone faked the document.

447
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Well, that's ordinary.

448
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
That's not fraudulent.

449
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Well, that's-

450
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,820
Fraudulent would be the Russians signed off on them and weren't officers in the company.

451
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
Oh, that's interesting too.

452
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Just fucking recording everything, huh?

453
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
That's interesting too.

454
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Yeah, that's just the thing right there.

455
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
That shit.

456
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,820
I have it set.

457
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
When are you going to turn on me?

458
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
I'm going to turn on you.

459
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
I just don't want to make sure you don't turn on me.

460
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,820
Dude, I don't-

461
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
You're a journalist.

462
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Look at my history.

463
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
But you're still a journalist.

464
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Understood.

465
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
And I haven't had very good luck with journalists.

466
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
I see that.

467
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
But I also think-

468
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
Marie, Marie.

469
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
I'm trying to give you- have you ever had a journalist tell you that I think you're

470
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,820
just approaching- you're trusting them too much?

471
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Have you ever had a journalist tell you that?

472
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
No, I did.

473
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
No, no.

474
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
No, so that should tell you something.

475
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
But you're an ex-journalist.

476
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,820
That's a good thing.

477
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I'm not an ex-journalist.

478
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Dude, I took a chance with you.

479
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Don't worry.

480
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Well, you did take a chance.

481
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
If I thought you were- I wouldn't have had you.

482
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
You wouldn't be here talking with me.

483
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,820
What I'm saying is someone gets your shit and like, you know, like, fucks me.

484
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
No, but okay.

485
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Oh, no, no, I wasn't gonna get my shit.

486
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
I don't think I've said anything.

487
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Anything I've said right now, I would say on a daily show.

488
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Dude, I didn't-

489
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
I didn't-

490
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I actually wasn't supposed to.

491
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I wasn't supposed to record.

492
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
I actually accidentally did in it.

493
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,820
But now, oh, hey, could think maybe you could read those texts for us?

494
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Yeah.

495
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
I mean, not like-

496
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
I'm not recording or anything.

497
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
No, we read them on camera.

498
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
I don't care if you're recording.

499
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
It's very easy.

500
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Yeah, just for ourselves.

501
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
Because you won't give us the other things.

502
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
So I'm gonna-

503
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
I'm gonna give you shit.

504
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
I really want to listen to day one of the fucking date.

505
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
This is my-

506
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
It's my bounty.

507
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
I took a risk, too.

508
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
You know, I didn't know if that guy was gonna walk out or like, you know, I spent a bunch

509
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,820
of money on bullshit.

510
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,820
I know, I know.

511
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
You didn't.

512
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Yeah, but you-

513
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
We're all taking it.

514
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
We have to.

515
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
We're trusting each other.

516
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
That's the way we have to do it.

517
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,820
Yeah, and-

518
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,820
And you're trust-

519
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
I wasn't sure and I-

520
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,820
No, and then I spoke to you on the phone and I was like, no, I think he's good.

521
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,820
Yeah, you didn't.

522
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
But first, I thought you were crazy.

523
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,820
I was like, I think he's crazy.

524
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
I am crazy.

525
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
No, I thought, you know, he thought you're like a madman, up the streets.

526
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
Because you know what I thought you were?

527
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
I thought you were stalking me since 2014, actually.

528
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,820
Why?

529
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Because I thought, you know what, this sounds a lot like the guy who said he was from Vice

530
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
in 2014 during the Sony hack.

531
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
He said, come down to LA and hide in my basement.

532
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Dude, I-

533
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Listen to me.

534
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,820
There was a guy-

535
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,820
I didn't tell you this yet.

536
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
I was in the room-

537
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,820
It was you.

538
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
I was in the room with Seth Rogen.

539
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Yeah.

540
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,820
And his partner, Evan.

541
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,820
Yeah.

542
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
At the fucking lot.

543
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Yeah.

544
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
When the shit went down, I got the only interview with Seth and Franco and all the people.

545
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
That's good.

546
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
And it's online.

547
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Yeah.

548
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
And then they pull the movie.

549
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,820
And I get a call from Seth and he's like, dude, they're fucking canceling the movie.

550
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Because I told him they're gonna cancel this fucking movie.

551
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,820
He's like, how do they do that?

552
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
I said, I don't know.

553
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
But then I'm driving and I see them taking the poster down.

554
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm like, this is like Nazi Germany.

555
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
What the fuck is going on?

556
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Yeah.

557
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,820
Go over to the fucking thing.

558
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
They're smoking tons of weed.

559
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
And I'm like, guys, first thing's first.

560
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,820
I like, I like marijuana too, but you need to put that bong down because this is some fucked

561
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
up shit.

562
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Right?

563
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Yeah.

564
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
And they got on the phone with Michael Linden and listened to it all.

565
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Michael Linden.

566
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
And they fucking.

567
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,820
I sat next to him at the dead Andy Drecky's screening of the Jinx.

568
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I sat right next to him.

569
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Didn't know who he was.

570
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
That day I was looking through his inbox and posting it all online.

571
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Anyway, I'll read you these texts and then I gotta go.

572
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
No, okay.

573
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
Come on.

574
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
I'll do it.

575
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
So what was the end of your story?

576
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,820
So, you remember the interviews based on Vice's shit, right?

577
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Wait, on Vice's shit?

578
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
We went to North Korea, right?

579
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Oh, was that really?

580
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Yeah, and they called me up like two years before the movie came out and they said, can

581
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
you hook us up with the guys that went to North Korea?

582
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
We'll pay them.

583
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
We need research.

584
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Okay.

585
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
Franco was writing for me at the time.

586
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
Okay.

587
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Right?

588
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
So, man, that really ended weird.

589
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Franco now does AA speeches all over Los Angeles.

590
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Does it really?

591
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
That's his redemption?

592
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,820
I can email him right now or text him and he'll fucking call me.

593
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,820
He'll fuck to anybody.

594
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Tell me who's the sponsor.

595
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Who won't talk to me now is Seth, though.

596
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I didn't do anything wrong to him.

597
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
They just said...

598
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
Why?

599
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Because they basically Hollywood said, we can't have rock'n'roll in this shit anymore.

600
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Why?

601
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Why did you fuck with them?

602
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Well, because Vice was a golden ticket for a lot of people.

603
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Why?

604
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
I don't know.

605
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
I'm still not asking that question.

606
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
Why anyone thought that?

607
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Yeah.

608
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Now it's all in the Wall Street Journal, so I don't have to convince anyone.

609
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Read this so I can tune this out.

610
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Here's the Tammy text.

611
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Thank you, David.

612
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Just got your book.

613
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Can't wait to read it.

614
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Congratulations.

615
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
And that looks like it was from a few days ago.

616
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
It doesn't say the date.

617
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
Today, 5.33 p.m.

618
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,820
So that would be the first day of the interview following the interview, right?

619
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Actually, the interview again.

620
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
I hope you like it.

621
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,820
This is David.

622
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Just so you know, I'm in LA right now with Val Brochement, who is filming a documentary.

623
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,820
She isn't true.

624
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
Told me it wasn't true.

625
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Rocco Castoro is filming a documentary.

626
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Rocco doesn't want to be a credit.

627
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
I don't want the credit.

628
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
He's so Hollywood.

629
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
I do want the credit.

630
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
And, you know, it's also a discredit.

631
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
The whole discredits it if you're shooting a documentary on yourself.

632
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,820
Hey, hey.

633
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
A documentary on themselves?

634
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
What are you, a fucking rapper?

635
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Yeah, I mean, come on, dude.

636
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
It's true.

637
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
I hope you like it.

638
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Just so you know, I'm in LA right now with Val Brochement, who is filming a documentary

639
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,820
set on a camera that you're really unhappy with me and how I treated you.

640
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
I don't know if you talked to him or told him that.

641
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
But if you do feel that way, I'm so sorry to hear it.

642
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,820
As I told Val, I have the utmost respect for you and everything you've done.

643
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
And I have tried hard to treat you well.

644
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
And I've done anything wrong.

645
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
I sincerely apologize.

646
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
Which, let's be clear.

647
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
You didn't say that.

648
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
No.

649
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
The reporter said that.

650
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
And I clearly said, I did not speak to Tammy.

651
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Who is Val?

652
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Question mark, exclamation mark, question mark, question mark.

653
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,820
I do not know this person in question mark.

654
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,820
And then like the, ooh, like the face, the emojis, right?

655
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Tammy.

656
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,820
And then David says, he's the son of the DB executive committed suicide in 2014.

657
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
She says, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.

658
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Question mark, question mark.

659
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Okay.

660
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
Like almost at the point where I'm like, does she know Val?

661
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
I do not see the email.

662
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,820
That was my first I was like, does she know Val?

663
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
But no, she's just, that's how she talks.

664
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
I didn't send emails there.

665
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
She doesn't remember.

666
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
Okay.

667
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
It's fine.

668
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
He might have been lying.

669
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Don't worry.

670
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
Don't worry.

671
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
I do not know him and I have never had a conversation with him.

672
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Period.

673
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
I believe you 100%.

674
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
Don't worry.

675
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
It's unbelievable.

676
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
People are weird.

677
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Can you please call me?

678
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
We have the footage.

679
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
You didn't say it.

680
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,820
He said a lot of shit, but you didn't say that.

681
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Hey, Tom.

682
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
This is Tom Hayes.

683
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,820
So he suspects that you just don't remember what just happened and you don't have video

684
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
cameras.

685
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
No, he's drunk or some shit.

686
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
No, but sending it to you.

687
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
He wasn't planning on sending these to me.

688
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,820
I forced him to do it when I sent him that email in the morning.

689
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
Oh really?

690
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
He panicked.

691
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Why?

692
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Yeah, why?

693
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Think about it.

694
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,820
He was in the WALT in here the next day and I don't know if he was either, he probably

695
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,820
wasn't going to bring these up because it would escalate it, but this was his backstop.

696
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
I was in.

697
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
And I said, that's my motherfucker.

698
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Do you remember when he left?

699
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,820
When he left, he said, he said, remember about tomorrow there's going to be a big announcement?

700
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
Yeah, and he didn't make an announcement.

701
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
Nothing happened.

702
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
He said, Tammy was in.

703
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
He wanted me to be his dildo.

704
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Yeah, to make the announcement for him.

705
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
And I said, you're the dildo, bro.

706
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,820
Sorry.

707
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,540
Because he says, hey Tom, I was meeting today with Al Brochement and like this is, I have

708
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
no problem.

709
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,260
This is how I'm going to talk on my daily show.

710
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Yeah.

711
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,420
You know, I'm just going to call journalists, dildos and stuff because they are, and this

712
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
is ridiculous.

713
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,100
Like, hey Tom, I was meeting today with Al Brochement who's involved in Deutsche Bank

714
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,980
Sider and he told me, as we're being filmed for a documentary he's doing, once again,

715
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,300
Rocco Castoro is doing, that you and Sarah were very unhappy with how I treated you in

716
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
the book.

717
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,060
I don't know if you've talked to Val or told him that, but this is how you feel.

718
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,700
I am very sorry.

719
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Who is he?

720
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
My mom was.

721
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
This is Tom.

722
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,420
I didn't realize you would use so much about her.

723
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,700
That caused problems between mom and Sarah and this is, he went to jail, right?

724
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Yeah.

725
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
14 years.

726
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,940
That caused problems between mom and Sarah, but they always hated each other.

727
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,300
My honest view is that it was a bit hyperbolic and that Japanese Libor is not linked to retail

728
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
products at all.

729
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,380
I mean, this guy has really valid points.

730
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,860
Certainly not credit cards and strident loans.

731
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,420
I think you conflated USD and, is it Japanese Libor?

732
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,140
I also failed to look properly at what triggered the investigation.

733
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,500
It's low balling and what the rules actually weren't as is the case, but I can't expect

734
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,420
you to read a book for the defense, which is interesting that he says that.

735
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,140
You can't read a book for the defense.

736
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,060
He's basically saying, you need to be salacious, I get it.

737
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,260
You wrote it in the absence of all the fresh evidence.

738
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,420
He's also saying he didn't help me.

739
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Yes.

740
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,180
Well, he hedges that later.

741
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,100
So he's fair at least.

742
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,580
You wrote it in the absence of all the fresh evidence we now have in new witnesses.

743
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,740
That's interesting because he wrote it without that.

744
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
He could have included that.

745
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,380
The book wasn't even out yet.

746
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
That's true.

747
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,100
He wrote it at a time when I was considered guilty by most in the book, at least caused

748
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
a review of that narrative.

749
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
That's where he's fair.

750
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,380
I know that because of all the mail that was sent to me by complete strangers, which

751
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,900
again is like, what mail, like the book's not out yet.

752
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,340
So I guess what he's saying is mail that while David was doing his reporting, they mailed

753
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,820
him saying, hey, I'm sorry, this happened to you and that's the only thing I can imagine.

754
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,580
Sources and friends of his?

755
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,260
I don't know yet who David was calling, right?

756
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
That's the only thing I can think of.

757
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,460
And Sarah Deffo wasn't happy with it.

758
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,860
Maybe he heard from Andrew Verity, who's the FT reporter who you know.

759
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
He contacted me.

760
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
That's the guy.

761
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,860
Holy shit.

762
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Andrew Verity.

763
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
He contacted me on Twitter.

764
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,860
He wants to talk to me.

765
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
One more.

766
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
I have, look, I have things for him.

767
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
Well, that's the view.

768
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
Maybe you should talk to him now.

769
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
Fuck, yeah.

770
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Good thing you regret this thing.

771
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,740
I did tell him that I thought the book was too light on the BOE and the treasury rule

772
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
on this.

773
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,980
I only discovered Mom Knew Tom Scholar.

774
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,060
So much was only just discovered Mom Knew Tom Scholar.

775
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,060
So much was hidden.

776
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,140
So Sarah hates him.

777
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
That's the one.

778
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
That's why I said the wife.

779
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
I said that on camera, the wife hates you.

780
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Yes, he did.

781
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
I did.

782
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
I said that positively.

783
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,420
Bar the RBC section that you never spoke to me about.

784
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
Their narrative was wrong.

785
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
RBC section?

786
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
So don't worry if you even worry.

787
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
I have no idea.

788
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
So you got something wrong.

789
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
RBC section.

790
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
It is.

791
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
Risk, uh...

792
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Risk something.

793
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
Strangely, I like you, David.

794
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
Risk break up.

795
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
This is the weirdest text I've ever read.

796
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Strangely.

797
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
Strangely, I like you, David.

798
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,100
But as you say in your book, this guy's actually fucking great.

799
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,660
Sometimes friends aren't friends.

800
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,020
And, you know, that's what Barrett was going off about.

801
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
It's good.

802
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Friends.

803
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Because he learned the hard way, right?

804
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
That's true.

805
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
He's saying what you're saying.

806
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Yeah.

807
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Hopefully, in this occasion, I do get it.

808
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Wait, when did I say that?

809
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Well, that's what you said to me.

810
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
You said David was your friend.

811
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Oh, I did.

812
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
And you can't be friends.

813
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
You can't be friends with journalists, Val.

814
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
You can't.

815
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Yeah, you're right.

816
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
You know what I mean?

817
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
You can.

818
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
I'll tell you this.

819
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
You can.

820
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
And the problem with David and me, for me, is this.

821
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,340
He used you for sources on other stories, then you thought of him as a friend, which

822
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,820
that is kosher in certain regards, where if you've used a source and you like that person

823
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,420
and you want to be a human, you know, so I thought it was, I thought we were friends.

824
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
So I called him a friend.

825
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
I called him.

826
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
It was the first story that he called me.

827
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
He used you.

828
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
No, he didn't say this.

829
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
We were friends.

830
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,860
And then all of a sudden, it became his best interest to not be friends with me and to

831
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
use me instead.

832
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860
And then that's what happened.

833
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,740
But you can never be friends with your sources.

834
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,860
But see, and the difference is like, I can shoot a film about you.

835
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,220
How do you not be friends if you're five years and talking to me?

836
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
Oh, shit.

837
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
You're a human, right?

838
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,020
That's why you don't take five years to report something.

839
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,020
You make a fucking documentary.

840
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
That's why you do it.

841
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,420
Like, I'm not joking.

842
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,220
Like, I don't buy this bullshit that people are like, well, I'm a print journalist.

843
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,780
Well, then you're fucking a dinosaur.

844
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,540
Like, you have to do all of it.

845
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,820
And it's really important because this proves it.

846
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,060
This fucking, you know, regurgitation is better shit, right?

847
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,940
So it's like, strangely, I like you, David, but as you say in your books, sometimes friends

848
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
aren't friends.

849
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,660
Hopefully in this occasion, I do get it.

850
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
Maybe I'm wrong.

851
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
I'm not sure if Sarah wants us to talk.

852
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,060
To be honest, I'm confused.

853
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,060
He said, thanks, Tom.

854
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
For what?

855
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,060
And he said, for your response.

856
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
Oh, that's okay.

857
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,020
And it looks like, it says today, so it looks like that was at five.

858
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,220
That was right after the interview, so he was fucking furious about that shit.

859
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,860
And then the next day he wrote and said, thanks, Tom.

860
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
Oh, that's okay.

861
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,780
He said, if it is okay, I tell the TV producer that you're not unhappy with how I've treated

862
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
you.

863
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,300
Otherwise, I'm concerned they're going to take valid his word that you aren't happy

864
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,300
with me.

865
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,900
What the fuck, my, he does not fit, there are cameras there, I don't have to take you

866
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
at your word.

867
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Why is he texting?

868
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Why is he showing you this?

869
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
I don't know.

870
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
It's ridiculous.

871
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,420
You think I expected to get this back 10 minutes after I fucking e-mail, but I knew

872
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,900
if I waited the morning that whatever trap he had laid, I just ganged it.

873
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
So weird.

874
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Or if he didn't, then it was fine.

875
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Yeah, I can't talk.

876
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,180
It says, I was talking to the TV producer that you're not unhappy, now I'm a TV producer

877
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
obviously.

878
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,260
Otherwise, I'm concerned they're going to take valid his word that you aren't happy

879
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,260
with me.

880
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,260
Yeah, I can't talk to him, but isn't that guy someone, someone who's dad died?

881
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,760
He said, yes.

882
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,060
And then he, Tom says, the producer or Val, which he's like, I don't, I don't want to

883
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
laugh at that.

884
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
He's confused.

885
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,780
But then he says, I'll level with you.

886
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,460
But then David says, the producer, right?

887
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,260
Yeah, I can't talk to him, but isn't that guy someone's who's dad died?

888
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
Yes.

889
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
Tom.

890
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,860
The producer or Val question mark, I'll level with you.

891
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,700
This is still Tom.

892
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
The producer.

893
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Oh, and I would see what he's saying.

894
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,260
He's saying, will you, can I, who, who should I tell?

895
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Right, right, right.

896
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Sorry, that's my mistake.

897
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,000
You can show him this part of the chat, but then they talked about something else.

898
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,060
This one was the only one not on, you don't remember, these are on signal.

899
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,060
So a text screenshot is one thing.

900
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:25,460
But if I'm texting on signal and I have it auto-delete and you do that, you better be

901
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,220
fucking ready to rumble.

902
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,500
From my perspective, if you better be ready to fucking rumble, I'll wait 10 years and

903
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I'm going to get you.

904
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
I texted your stuff to Barrett.

905
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I don't give a shit.

906
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Barrett's fine.

907
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
That's because I didn't introduce you to Barrett.

908
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
It's like, here's this guy.

909
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I sent Barrett all my...

910
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I told him, I like him.

911
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
He's a pretty good guy.

912
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
He talks a lot.

913
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,060
You know, but I think he knows what he's doing and he appears to be saying, honestly, I like

914
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
him.

915
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
Thank you.

916
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,060
That's what my assessment of you.

917
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Thank you.

918
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,420
I think Barrett realized that we know a lot of the same people.

919
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,700
Once I told him that I was commissioned to write We Are Anonymous, which is Parmi Olson's

920
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,460
book and he's in it, and how meta this was and that I wanted to commission him before

921
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,220
he went to jail, but we just didn't get to that point.

922
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,620
And I know different people, Del Cameron and Daily Dot people and all these people.

923
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,060
And I have a deep understanding of anonymous.

924
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,180
And we talked about how that morphed into Paul and my Paul right.

925
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,420
I need to finish this and then maybe, you know, I just don't throw me into it because

926
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,780
I don't want to like walk.

927
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,820
I got thrown into some group to give a day that was like, cuck, what was it?

928
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,420
It was like, no cucks allowed part two or something and I was like, what the fuck did

929
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
someone put me in?

930
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,340
It was like some fucking neo-nazi meme shit.

931
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,340
And I'm like, dude, someone's trying to set me up or something and I just said, fuck all

932
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
you Nazis.

933
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
And I left the grid.

934
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Hi, I guess I hope you're doing well.

935
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,460
I mean, this is again, you know, this is one for us to hear this.

936
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,460
I hope you're doing well.

937
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
I'm in LA recording.

938
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
And this is 7 52 a.m.

939
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
So that would be the next morning.

940
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,460
He screenshot 9 24.

941
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
Okay.

942
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:08,460
So you got to remember that he screenshot this after I wrote him.

943
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
Okay.

944
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
You know what I'm saying?

945
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Because this was his big news.

946
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,460
And then he said, oh, wait, I can use Rocco.

947
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
Like he like, right?

948
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,460
He thought he could be a step.

949
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
All right.

950
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Look at this.

951
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
And then he says at the end.

952
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Well, you're, I can't remember if he said your friend.

953
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:28,460
He said our friends, our friends, our friends have some stuff to tell you in the master

954
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
interview.

955
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,460
I don't know if you caught that.

956
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,460
I did not.

957
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Yeah, he says it to you.

958
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
That's why I didn't tell you.

959
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
So wait, wait, what?

960
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
He says our friends or something.

961
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
I'm not.

962
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
It may not be correct.

963
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Something friends.

964
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
It doesn't say your friends.

965
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,460
I don't think the world will be real fucked up and I'm going to hit him on that.

966
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,460
You know, I'm not going to hit him on it, but I'm going to complain.

967
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,460
And be like, you know, David, if you talk about this again, you know that I'm doing this

968
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
independently, right?

969
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,460
Like, like I didn't know that you've known down for four fucking years.

970
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,460
Like you are in five years.

971
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
You are in that seat.

972
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
I'm not in that seat.

973
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,460
I got in and I got out and I got you on camera.

974
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
I'm not your fucking friend.

975
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
So don't make me your enemy.

976
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,460
And, you know, I'm going to basically be like, how would you like it if I fucking said,

977
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,460
Oh, Val's got a story is right.

978
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Val's got a story is right.

979
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
He's got a New York Times reporter.

980
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
He's writing it with a New York Times reporter.

981
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,460
You wouldn't like it at all because you did everything within your power to make sure

982
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
that no one could say that.

983
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,460
So we know you wouldn't like it.

984
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,460
And, you know, go to Mark Thompson and ask him about me.

985
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Ask him how dangerous a fucking am with the media.

986
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,460
Like, you know, go ask him and then go ask him.

987
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
Yeah.

988
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
The pedophilia.

989
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
He was good.

990
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,460
Pedophilia.

991
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,460
He covered up at the BBC that came out two weeks after he started at the Times.

992
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,460
Anyway, hi, I hope you're doing well.

993
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,460
I'm in LA recording a podcast interview with Val and he's filming a documentary.

994
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,460
He said on camera yesterday that you told him that when you and I met in NYT at NYT.

995
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,460
Yeah, that's like, you didn't say at NYT because you didn't know they were at NYT, right?

996
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,460
No, they said outside in a cafe.

997
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,460
Yeah, but you never brought up.

998
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:10,460
He's bringing up that he's giving up the fact that she met him at a New York Times.

999
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,460
He got confused though.

1000
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,460
He's not doing that on purpose.

1001
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,460
No, but exactly he's giving up something.

1002
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,460
I told that if I got a film deal that didn't include Val, it would be fine because I would

1003
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,460
just throw lots of money at Val and he would be pacified.

1004
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Is that true that you said that to Val?

1005
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,460
And this seems a bit...

1006
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Set up.

1007
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,460
Yeah.

1008
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm not going to say that.

1009
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Hello.

1010
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,460
But...

1011
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Very much.

1012
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,460
I'm going to say this in the text.

1013
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Right.

1014
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,460
Screenshot it, right?

1015
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Because this isn't the morning.

1016
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Right.

1017
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
I know.

1018
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
Okay.

1019
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,460
I told you I got a film deal that didn't include Val would be fine because I would just throw

1020
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,460
lots of money at Val and he would be pacified.

1021
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Is that true that she said that to Val?

1022
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,460
I have no recollection of ever having said anything like that to you or anyone else.

1023
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
That was David.

1024
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Odessa says, I never said that.

1025
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
No, I would have never said that.

1026
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
I don't remember talking to you about that.

1027
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
Or Val.

1028
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Dot, dot, dot.

1029
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
That's it.

1030
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,460
You got a problem with this Odessa woman.

1031
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
I don't know who she is.

1032
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,460
I'd love to stick a fucking camera in her face.

1033
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,460
She texted me just when we walked in the door.

1034
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,460
Well, don't do it now.

1035
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,460
Because.

1036
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,460
Do it tomorrow.

1037
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,460
Make sure it's there.

1038
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,460
Oh, okay.

1039
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
I've got.

1040
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,460
Okay.

1041
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,460
We are going to go today.

1042
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,460
15th, February 15th.

1043
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
What's that?

1044
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,460
I don't know.

1045
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,460
We're heard from him.

1046
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
Who's that?

1047
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
David.

1048
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
No.

1049
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
I will call him Monday.

1050
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,460
What we're doing is...

1051
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
You're going to call him tomorrow?

1052
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,460
Monday.

1053
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,460
It's Sunday.

1054
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,460
I don't know if it's Sunday.

1055
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,460
You're going to call him tomorrow.

1056
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
Do you want a camera?

1057
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Oh.

1058
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
If you want to do that, we can do that.

1059
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Yeah.

1060
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,460
And I probably...

1061
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
I got that reversed.

1062
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Look, I was saying if you want to ask one camera.

1063
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,460
Oh.

1064
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
If you want to ask one camera.

1065
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,460
To call him?

1066
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
And ask him for the reports.

1067
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
After we talk to someone.

1068
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
I think they could...

1069
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
I don't know.

1070
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
It's up to you.

1071
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Otherwise, you know, I do want to talk to some other people.

1072
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
Okay.

1073
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
And if I have to go to the New York Times to interview him.

1074
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
In Andrew.

1075
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,460
That's when I'll ask.

1076
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Okay.

1077
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,460
So, my own documents are the key to all of this.

1078
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,460
Fragrant loan documents in my point of view.

1079
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,460
And I'm talking about in terms of what I'm covering.

1080
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
But I also think in the larger story.

1081
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,460
So, the only way I can manage to do this in terms of the way I can understand it.

1082
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
Because I don't understand why David walked out.

1083
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
There's multiple reasons why I could have walked out.

1084
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
We'll go over it with you.

1085
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
So, we're going to go over it.

1086
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,460
And I normally wouldn't do this, but I'm going to do that.

1087
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Because I don't know what transpired.

1088
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
I need context.

1089
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
And I'm going to ask David.

1090
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
For the same context.

1091
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,460
Okay.

1092
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
And I'll go over it with him too.

1093
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
If he needs to.

1094
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
But he has a recording.

1095
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
So, I don't take it.

1096
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Thank you.

1097
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,460
That's correct.

1098
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
The question.

1099
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,460
So, did I miss you saying you're going to go to New York to interview him?

1100
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
If I have to.

1101
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,460
I mean, he said, you know, I asked if I could interview him.

1102
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,460
He said he would.

1103
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,460
But maybe it would be best if we do it back in the New York Times building.

1104
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
With the PR team there.

1105
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,460
Or at least maybe he didn't say with PR team that he's going to check with the PR team.

1106
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,460
I actually would like the PR team there.

1107
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
Yeah?

1108
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,460
Yeah.

1109
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
I don't really have like 10 questions.

1110
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Right.

1111
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,460
I need you to help me decipher some of this.

1112
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,460
Because the relationship between you and David and what they're going to edit out most likely.

1113
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
Because it doesn't make sense without context.

1114
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
I need context on.

1115
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,460
So, that's to me why this is a, you know.

1116
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,460
Another thing.

1117
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,460
You have your own issues in the New York Times.

1118
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,460
No, I don't.

1119
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Really?

1120
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
No.

1121
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:42,460
I think until there's evidence that, no, I said other women had issues with the reporting

1122
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
that she did.

1123
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
A lot of women.

1124
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
I don't know.

1125
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
I'm confused.

1126
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
I'm confused.

1127
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
Yeah.

1128
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,460
That's separate from this.

1129
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
And that's like, I'm not going to bring that up there.

1130
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,460
No, of course not.

1131
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
I'm just.

1132
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,460
I'm just.

1133
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,460
I mean, like every New York Times every day, like I think most people do.

1134
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
They won't ban you.

1135
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,460
That's what you're saying.

1136
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
They're not going to ban you from venturing.

1137
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,460
I don't mean if they do.

1138
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
I hope they do.

1139
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
I hope somebody bans me.

1140
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Everything like, you know, like why not?

1141
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,460
But so yeah, we're going to review this because I need you to help me decipher.

1142
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Okay.

1143
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:17,460
What went down by David left some things on the first day, which I don't think they're

1144
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
going to air much of.

1145
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
They pretty much said that.

1146
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,460
Did they?

1147
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,460
Oh, they said like they said M-[Redacted] being there was an issue.

1148
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,460
Maybe that's the makeup.

1149
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
I don't know.

1150
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,460
Nobody is going to.

1151
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,460
That's that's that's just talk.

1152
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
Nobody knows yet.

1153
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Nobody knows but when are they supposed to air?

1154
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
I don't know.

1155
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
I don't know.

1156
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:45,460
This is March 18th or a little more possibly, but that's what gets the problems in March

1157
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
18th.

1158
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,460
He said the guests off the top said you heard the conversation.

1159
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,460
That means there must be another story coming out about fc.

1160
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,460
We don't know because you can't say that for sure.

1161
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,460
But you said that he would tell the story of NFC from the book.

1162
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
So there's a couple possibilities.

1163
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
Okay, okay, okay.

1164
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Is that the way he presented the thing to us, he said, it will start with David and Barbados.

1165
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
David and Barbados?

1166
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
Who started with David?

1167
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,460
Who started with David and Barbados?

1168
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
That's what Eric said to us on the phone.

1169
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Eric, who?

1170
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,460
The producer.

1171
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,460
Oh, what?

1172
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,460
No, and the guy, what's his name?

1173
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,460
The fucking guy from the dating.

1174
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Why would he be in Barbados?

1175
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
No, it's not Barbados.

1176
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,460
The name of the guy that is the David podcast...

1177
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Oh, Barbaro.

1178
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Barbaro.

1179
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
Well, the arm is here.

1180
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
Well, I...

1181
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
You're thinking, oh my god, John McAfee.

1182
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,460
I'm thinking...

1183
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,460
No, I'm not thinking John McAfee.

1184
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,460
I'm thinking Barbados.

1185
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,460
That's another thing.

1186
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
That he will introduce that.

1187
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
Yes, yes.

1188
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,460
But we don't know for sure.

1189
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
We can say a lot of shit.

1190
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,460
You know what I said David wasn't coming here to talk about?

1191
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,460
David.

1192
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Yeah.

1193
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,460
And then he said a lot of bullshit.

1194
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,460
How many did he say?

1195
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
He wants two videos.

1196
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,460
Listen, nobody knows until the footage is put together.

1197
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,460
And you have to understand, like, here's my thing.

1198
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,460
It's like, I want to shoot you listening to whatever they put together for the daily.

1199
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,460
So whenever that happens, I got to send Ellington over here just to shoot that.

1200
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
You know what I'm saying?

1201
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,460
We can report it.

1202
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,460
We can do it here, Kevin.

1203
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
Yeah, but no, I need to have it the same.

1204
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Like, I'm trying to up the standard for this kind of shit, you know?

1205
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:36,460
And another thing I thought as I got to tonight was cancelled is that if we do the podcast with Scott, you should be there.

1206
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Well, I wanted to film it, but I just had a miscommunication on the phone with you.

1207
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,460
I really thought that you guys didn't want us to...

1208
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,460
I think we wanted a break, which I totally...

1209
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,460
I mean, the crew needed a break, too.

1210
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
We didn't need a break.

1211
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,460
That's my miscommunication.

1212
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,460
Then I totally...

1213
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
If I would have...

1214
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
I had him booked.

1215
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,460
I'd rather than be here right now, but it's fine.

1216
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,460
It's actually worked out.

1217
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,460
It worked out.

1218
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,460
It worked out.

1219
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
And then while we're...

1220
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,460
I have some questions, so I'm going to stop this when I do.

1221
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,460
And that's why we're doing this, because I don't understand some of this stuff.

1222
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,460
Okay.

1223
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,460
But...

1224
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,460
Because I need context for your and David's relationship.

1225
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Okay?

1226
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Now, hold on.

1227
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
Hold on.

1228
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,460
Hold on.

1229
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Let me pause it.

1230
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Oh, wait.

1231
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
There's even going to be a volume through this.

1232
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,460
You look fantastic, though.

1233
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
I look like an idiot.

1234
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Come on. Here you go.

1235
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,460
I got it.

1236
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
I got it.

1237
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
You look so hot.

1238
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,460
I'm going to go with 1964 Southern...

1239
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
No, you do.

1240
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,460
That's why you look cool.

1241
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
You look so hot.

1242
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,460
I'm just outside.

1243
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,460
You guys should be handing out flyers in Baptist Southern Louisiana.

1244
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
What the fuck?

1245
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,460
That's kind of fun.

1246
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
Is there no volume?

1247
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Because this is going through this now.

1248
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
1964.

1249
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,460
I'm just telling you, I'm good at this.

1250
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Thank you.

1251
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,460
What?

1252
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
That's all you need to say.

1253
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Thank you.

1254
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
You said pretty sweet.

1255
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,460
Yes, sir.

1256
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
No, I don't.

1257
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,460
Thank you.

1258
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,460
Thank you.

1259
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,460
Thank you.

1260
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,460
All right.

1261
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
Stupid.

1262
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,460
It's not working.

1263
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,460
Oh, wait.

1264
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
I mean, him next to David...

1265
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,460
I don't think it's going to work through the sound, maybe.

1266
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,460
I think I have to put it through here.

1267
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,460
You can't air drop the sound out.

1268
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,460
Oh, can I air drop it through there?

1269
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,460
Oh.

1270
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,460
Oh, yeah.

1271
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
Oh, there you go.

1272
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,460
Yeah, I used that.

1273
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,460
I built a mirror in Samsung.

1274
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
I think I made it in Samsung.

1275
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,460
Oh, that'll do it, too.

1276
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
Well, I had it on that.

1277
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,460
I had it on a mirror.

1278
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,460
Oh, you did?

1279
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Oh, maybe it's the other one.

1280
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,460
The only worst case scenario which I'm afraid of is that they won't play it.

1281
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
Yeah, exactly.

1282
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
Do you think that's possible?

1283
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,460
I think it's possible.

1284
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
What's the code for Apple TV?

1285
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
I'm sorry.

1286
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,460
It should show up on your phone somewhere.

1287
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460
Let me see.

1288
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,460
I'm just going to hit...

1289
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Apple TV code.

1290
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,460
I have to bring up the app, right?

1291
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,460
I don't know.

1292
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,460
Because I think it's going to play the sound through the TV.

1293
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
No, you don't need...

1294
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
That's because you're going through the Apple TV.

1295
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,460
No, I've just tried all the different outputs for sound.

1296
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Yeah.

1297
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,460
For some reason, I don't think the HDMI is carrying it.

1298
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Or try Bikki TV.

1299
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
Bikki TV.

1300
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Bikki TV.

1301
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Bikki TV.

1302
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Bikki TV.

1303
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
Bikki TV.

1304
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,460
Bikki TV.

1305
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,460
Bikki TV.

1306
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
Bikki TV.

1307
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Bikki TV.

1308
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
Yeah.

1309
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,460
That's the Apple TV.

1310
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Can I try the other...

1311
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,460
Let's just play it through here.

1312
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Can I play?

1313
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Here.

1314
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
The whole point is the sound.

1315
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
I want to hear how we did the sound.

1316
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
Yeah, but...

1317
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
I don't have the sound.

1318
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,460
I don't have the audio.

1319
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
This is not Eric's audio.

1320
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,460
This is from the onboard mic on the camera.

1321
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
Gotcha.

1322
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
That's terrible.

1323
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,460
Oh, we just plugged the speakers in there.

1324
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
Yeah, yeah.

1325
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
If you have an output, yeah.

1326
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
That works.

1327
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
Give me the...

1328
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1329
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,460
Oh, shit.

1330
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,460
Do you have that...

1331
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,460
That kind of plug?

1332
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
Mm-hmm.

1333
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,460
Good.

1334
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,460
Bill Maher.

1335
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,460
I miss Bill Maher.

1336
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,460
I love Bill Maher.

1337
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,460
I've got him recently.

1338
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
He did?

1339
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,460
What'd he do?

1340
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,460
Just like...

1341
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,460
What'd he say?

1342
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,460
What the fuck?

1343
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
What did he say?

1344
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,460
He didn't challenge Ben on the show

1345
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,460
the last time he was on.

1346
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Sometimes it's just too high.

1347
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
Bill Maher?

1348
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
Bill Maher.

1349
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Is it who the guy is?

1350
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Headphone.

1351
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,460
Sometimes it's too high as well.

1352
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Is it 10?

1353
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,460
This isn't working.

1354
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
Oh, I need this.

1355
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,460
I need a headphone.

1356
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Here, I got it.

1357
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
I have it, I have it.

1358
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
I think that's the...

1359
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
No, I got it.

1360
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
That's your aunt.

1361
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
No, no, no.

1362
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,460
Okay.

1363
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,460
They should have plugged in.

1364
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,460
They might not be plugged in.

1365
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Is it not plugged in?

1366
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Yeah, here we go.

1367
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
I think they have to be powered.

1368
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Yeah, it's not plugged in.

1369
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,460
Oh, okay.

1370
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
Yeah, yeah.

1371
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,460
Bill Maher always the same people coming on.

1372
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,460
I know.

1373
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,460
So it's like, okay.

1374
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,460
But, you know, I love Bill Maher.

1375
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
You can't...

1376
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
I want him to go on Bill Maher.

1377
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
Yeah, what's his name?

1378
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,460
He'll get us on the show.

1379
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,460
Okay, and I have your word.

1380
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,460
You're not going to leak audio.

1381
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,460
This is for reviewing with me.

1382
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Because I know you're recording.

1383
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Okay.

1384
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,460
And I'm taking that chance.

1385
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
But I am...

1386
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,460
On the type almost, on my son's...

1387
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
And I...

1388
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Wait, just can you stop bouncing stuff on your son's life?

1389
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,460
That's ridiculous.

1390
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
On my life.

1391
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
Thank you.

1392
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
Fair enough.

1393
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,460
Because I mean, no one hurts you guys if you do it.

1394
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Okay.

1395
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,460
Ready?

1396
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,460
Please.

1397
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Marie, Marie, can you just stop and eat?

1398
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,460
I am, I am.

1399
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,460
Good grief.

1400
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,460
Both of you.

1401
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,460
Gosh.

1402
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
At least you make me laugh.

1403
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,460
You guys are hilarious.

1404
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,460
All right.

1405
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Was it funny?

1406
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Yeah.

1407
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,460
It's not funny.

1408
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
I'm just going to have a look at the court record.

1409
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,460
Go ahead.

1410
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,460
There you go.

1411
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,460
There you go.

1412
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Damn, it's live, Sarah.

1413
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,460
Ah.

1414
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,460
Sounds like you're plugging in your guitar, Val.

1415
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Yeah.

1416
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
It does actually.

1417
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460
By the way, those amps, they're good.

1418
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,460
Yeah.

1419
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
Apologize?

1420
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
That's right.

1421
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Work it out.

1422
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,460
Sometimes apologies went down.

1423
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,460
I mean, let's put this in context.

1424
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
You...

1425
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,460
He just apologized to you.

1426
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,460
And I think we have that, but it's on a different card.

1427
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,460
Okay.

1428
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
Well, I want to see that.

1429
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
Well, we have it.

1430
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,460
Literally, he says you apologize, and we switched.

1431
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,460
Like, it has two cards in it, and it switches over.

1432
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,460
And I couldn't find...

1433
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,460
Like, I would have to scrub through all the shit to do that,

1434
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,460
and, like, it would have taken me another hour.

1435
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
Like, it's just because it's at the very end,

1436
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,460
right before the end, and I didn't know where it was.

1437
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
Damage is done.

1438
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
There's irrevocable damage.

1439
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,460
It's really difficult to...

1440
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,460
It's really difficult to just sit there and say,

1441
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,460
Oh, what a lovely apology.

1442
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Thank you.

1443
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,460
Listen to me for it.

1444
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,460
But no, when lives are ruined, because what David did was...

1445
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,460
It's called a character assassination.

1446
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,460
He went on, and he tried to assassinate him.

1447
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,460
He tried to murder him.

1448
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,460
Now, I have been ruminating on as to why for many, many a day.

1449
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,460
And I came up with a few ideas.

1450
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,460
The one being the one I think I already brought up

1451
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,460
was to discredit me so that you can take this book

1452
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,460
and say, I did all this to myself.

1453
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,460
You know, and if I ever jump up and say,

1454
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,460
Hey, that's not true. I did this.

1455
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,460
And then you can just, oh, that's just drug,

1456
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,460
that's just drug addict Val.

1457
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,460
Don't listen to him.

1458
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,460
He's the credit card-thieving guy

1459
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,460
that's out for, that would sell his own fucking father

1460
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,460
for a movie deal.

1461
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,460
Oh, you fucker.

1462
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,460
I just can't believe you went that low.

1463
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,460
I still can't, I've never really bothered you.

1464
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
Incincidentally...

1465
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,460
But I don't let me go on a tangent.

1466
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,460
I'm sorry.

1467
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,460
No, I'm cutting you.

1468
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
No.

1469
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,460
Incincidentally enough.

1470
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,460
No.

1471
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
Because it's annoying.

1472
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,460
I wasn't really pissed off.

1473
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,460
No, it was good.

1474
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,460
You went through my head.

1475
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,460
You were really pissed.

1476
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,460
I had the thought.

1477
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,460
I had the thought.

1478
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,460
Oh, please, both of you are joining me crazy.

1479
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,460
You're talkers.

1480
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,460
The two of you together.

1481
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,460
Oh, and you're not a fucking talker?

1482
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,460
You're just pissed because you can't, you know,

1483
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,460
talk over brother-in-law.

1484
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,460
There's a question.

1485
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,460
So I say something.

1486
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,460
I went to the jump sign.

1487
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,460
Please, look at me.

1488
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,460
It's a big one.

1489
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
It's a stereo now.

1490
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
Okay.

1491
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,460
I was so angry.

1492
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,460
I had the thought that you're standing up

1493
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
and punching me in the face.

1494
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,460
No.

1495
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,460
I was thinking about that.

1496
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,460
No.

1497
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,460
And then I thought that was a bad idea,

1498
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,460
like you're saying, obviously.

1499
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,460
Because it was on camera.

1500
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,460
I was that angry.

1501
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,460
Like, I don't even fight.

1502
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,460
I don't even fight in the light.

1503
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,460
And you know what it is.

1504
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,460
So I was 23.

1505
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,460
Did you fail?

1506
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
I felt it.

1507
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
No.

1508
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,460
Nobody wants to work with you.

1509
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,460
Nobody does, right?

1510
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,460
No.

1511
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
I get to...

1512
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,460
When I read you and David,

1513
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,460
and I remember you saying the article

1514
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,460
would change your life.

1515
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,460
Oh, God.

1516
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
How many times did you say that?

1517
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,460
Oh, God.

1518
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,460
The article, your life's going to change.

1519
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,460
Oh, make me a star.

1520
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,460
You're going to make me a star.

1521
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
I remember that...

1522
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,460
Yes, you did say that.

1523
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,460
That was funny.

1524
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,460
Thank you.

1525
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,460
And then...

1526
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,460
Marie, what happened to all your friends?

1527
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,460
I've been humiliated at school.

1528
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,460
I mean, people don't want to...

1529
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,460
You know, I was mad.

1530
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,460
They don't want to come here.

1531
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,460
Is that true, Marla?

1532
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,460
I'm really sorry to hear that.

1533
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,460
He said that.

1534
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,460
Yeah.

1535
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
We've had a...

1536
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,460
You don't deserve any of this, Marla.

1537
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,460
Yeah, but that has nothing to do with the whole conversation.

1538
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,460
Yeah, but...

1539
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,460
It does, Marla.

1540
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,460
Yeah, it does, but...

1541
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,460
I do.

1542
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,460
And I'll tell you what.

1543
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,460
If someone had done something that I felt harmed one of my kids,

1544
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,460
the reaction I would have would be vicious and angry,

1545
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,460
and I would do anything that would protect my kids.

1546
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,460
So, if what you're saying is true,

1547
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,460
but has affected his life,

1548
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,460
I would have a very horrible reaction to it.

1549
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,460
Well, that's why I'm in a horrible reaction here.

1550
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,460
No, I get that.

1551
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,460
I hear you.

1552
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,460
Okay, you have a horrible reaction.

1553
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,460
I don't feel any sincerity, but...

1554
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,460
Well, part of it...

1555
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,460
Can I just say, Marie, it's a little rich to say,

1556
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,460
I'm not showing enough feeling when you blindside me

1557
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,460
by having a camera crew here to record it.

1558
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,460
I'm being very careful about the facial expressions I use,

1559
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,460
being very cognizant of the fact that there's a camera recording this.

1560
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,460
So, you see what happens here?

1561
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,460
So, it's really you. It's Huey Hayes.

1562
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,460
And, Roko, I must tell you,

1563
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,460
there's something very important.

1564
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,460
Three days after the article was published,

1565
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
I called his wife,

1566
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,460
and I told her all four consequences

1567
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,460
in my son's life,

1568
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,460
in Marla's life and my life.

1569
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,460
And she says, oh, really?

1570
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,460
He's in a valve like that.

1571
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,460
I said, do you know since that article?

1572
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,460
And you're referring to the...

1573
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,460
To the article and drug addiction and mischaracterization.

1574
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,460
I said, good question.

1575
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,460
Had your husband yelled at you at the...

1576
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,460
Or yelled at Val?

1577
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,460
That was later.

1578
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,460
That was later.

1579
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,460
PTA, okay.

1580
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,460
I thought that maybe had happened already too.

1581
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,460
No, that was...

1582
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,460
You're going to teach your conference.

1583
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,460
Can you imagine?

1584
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,460
And so that he pretends to be surprised

1585
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,460
is even more alive.

1586
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,460
He's known that since October.

1587
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,460
And there's not nothing.

1588
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,460
Nothing, nothing.

1589
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,460
Even I called his wife because he didn't know my text.

1590
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,460
He would not answer my text.

1591
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,460
Nothing.

1592
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,460
I said, David, what you've done is affecting my son.

1593
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
You are a father.

1594
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,460
Why have you done this?

1595
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Do you know that I'm...

1596
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,460
Val is not alone in the fucking desert.

1597
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,460
You know?

1598
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,460
In the vacuum inside it, right?

1599
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,460
Yeah.

1600
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,460
But he...

1601
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,460
He knows.

1602
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,460
So this is also important to put this...

1603
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,460
I don't know, somehow we can explain that.

1604
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,460
David pretends to...

1605
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,460
Oh, this is new information.

1606
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,460
Is that true?

1607
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,460
He's like, of course he's going to do that.

1608
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,460
He's trying to look good, right?

1609
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,460
So he's going to take the...

1610
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,460
Generally the opposition is stronger to him.

1611
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,460
So he's going to go with the flow

1612
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,460
in the sense where he's just going to say,

1613
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,460
if you start agreeing with us...

1614
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,460
Right now it's not...

1615
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,460
It's advantageous for him to give in a little bit, right?

1616
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,460
But what's strange is that he is now attacking you.

1617
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,460
You're saying, well, that's rich coming from you.

1618
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,460
Rich means, like, that's bullshit.

1619
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,460
Like, how hypocritical.

1620
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,460
I am hypocritical?

1621
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,460
Yeah, it's calling you hypocritical.

1622
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,460
Why?

1623
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
That's what...

1624
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,460
Every time you talk, you're working so much,

1625
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,460
and he flips out, you know?

1626
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,460
You see, it's something about you that you're like...

1627
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,460
Not about you, sorry.

1628
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,460
It's about...

1629
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,460
Is that you?

1630
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,460
Like, you know, personally or something?

1631
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,460
Well, it obviously is me.

1632
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,460
Yeah.

1633
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,460
No, no.

1634
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,460
Because they're rich doing...

1635
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,460
It's something, yeah.

1636
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,460
I call it bullshit.

1637
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,460
You do.

1638
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,460
But there's something that he's always...

1639
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,460
Yes.

1640
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,460
Because he didn't see this now.

1641
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,460
So he asked the other day,

1642
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,460
no, it doesn't matter what has happened.

1643
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,460
It was terrible, and that's...

1644
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,460
Well...

1645
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,460
So why...

1646
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,460
So I am making...

1647
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,460
I was lying about...

1648
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,460
I know.

1649
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,460
So you think I don't know?

1650
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,460
So I'm making...

1651
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,460
You're driving nuts.

1652
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,460
Yeah.

1653
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
But...

1654
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,460
Let's compare with me.

1655
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,460
It's just my prisons.

1656
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,460
I think so.

1657
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,460
Yeah.

1658
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,460
And you look...

1659
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,460
Because we talked about it the other night.

1660
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,460
Something about women.

1661
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,460
He's the only woman.

1662
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,460
He's not good with them.

1663
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,460
He's got, you know,

1664
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,460
history with bad behavior, you know?

1665
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,460
So, yeah.

1666
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,460
And he says I'm being rich like I'm...

1667
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,460
No, rich is not critical.

1668
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,460
Right?

1669
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,460
It's not what being rich means in America.

1670
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,460
Okay, wait.

1671
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,460
That's not on me.

1672
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,460
That's on you guys.

1673
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,460
I forget this is a girl, right?

1674
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,460
Well, look, I did not trust you.

1675
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,460
I did not trust you.

1676
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,460
That's fine.

1677
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,460
And I'm not...

1678
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,460
The camera's here, and I've...

1679
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,460
Can you hear that just one more time?

1680
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,460
I don't know what he's saying.

1681
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,460
He says he's being hypocritical about it.

1682
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,460
Did I hear it for you first of all?

1683
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,460
In English?

1684
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,460
I would have...

1685
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,460
But remember this.

1686
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,460
This is why also,

1687
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,460
I feel that this is disingenuous

1688
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,460
in that he says that the camera crew

1689
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,460
have got a camera crew here.

1690
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,460
And I've told him three times,

1691
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,460
I'm not with Val.

1692
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,460
I will leave.

1693
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,460
I offered to leave,

1694
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,460
which jeopardized and risked me with you.

1695
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,460
Like, you could have walked because I said that, right?

1696
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,460
But there was no other fair way to do it in my eyes.

1697
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,460
I'm just putting it in context.

1698
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,460
But remember, Rocco,

1699
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,460
is that if he says Val, you buy a camera crew.

1700
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,460
That means that it's something he can use against me.

1701
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,460
If you come independently on your own,

1702
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,460
he can't use it against me.

1703
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
Exactly.

1704
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,460
That's why he says to you,

1705
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,460
as much as Val's...

1706
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,460
Right.

1707
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,460
He incriminates you.

1708
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,460
Okay.

1709
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,460
Right.

1710
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,460
So, okay.

1711
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,460
Not incriminating.

1712
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,460
It's just like,

1713
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,460
something he can use against me.

1714
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,460
You can't say,

1715
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,460
Rocco came up independently on his shelf,

1716
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,460
but you don't.

1717
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,460
You do a thing.

1718
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,460
Which is what happened.

1719
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,460
If he says that,

1720
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,460
it doesn't sound good, right?

1721
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,460
No, right.

1722
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,460
All right.

1723
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,460
Let's hear it.

1724
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,460
Very horrible reaction to him.

1725
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,460
Well, that's why I'm not in a horrible reaction here.

1726
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,460
No, I get that.

1727
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,460
I hear you.

1728
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,460
Okay.

1729
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,460
You guys are in a horrible reaction.

1730
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,460
I don't feel any sincerity, but...

1731
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,460
Well, look.

1732
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,460
Part of...

1733
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,460
Can I just say, Marie,

1734
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,460
it's a little rich to say,

1735
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,460
I'm not showing enough feeling when you blindside me

1736
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,460
by having a camera crew here to record it.

1737
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,460
I'm being very careful

1738
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,460
about the facial expressions I use,

1739
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,460
being very cognizant of the fact

1740
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,460
that there's a camera recording this.

1741
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
And that's not on me.

1742
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
That's on you guys.

1743
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,460
I forget that there's a camera, right?

1744
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Well, look.

1745
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,460
I did not trust you.

1746
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,460
I did not trust you.

1747
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,460
That's fine.

1748
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,460
And I'm not...

1749
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,460
The camera's here,

1750
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,460
and I've given my permission for the camera.

1751
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,460
They're not here for you, first of all.

1752
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,460
Well...

1753
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,460
They're doing a thing about me,

1754
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,460
and you happen to be part of my life story right now.

1755
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
Is that so?

1756
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
Okay?

1757
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,460
It's not...

1758
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,460
I only bring up the camera in the context of,

1759
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,460
if you feel like I'm not exhibiting enough emotion

1760
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,460
or senior sincere,

1761
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,460
that's probably a something...

1762
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,460
That's not what she's saying.

1763
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,460
That's not what she's saying.

1764
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,460
That's not what she's saying.

1765
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,460
That's not what she's saying.

1766
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,460
I'm sorry.

1767
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,460
And that's it.

1768
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,460
And I appreciate it.

1769
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,460
No, I felt it.

1770
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,460
He made me...

1771
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,460
I didn't appreciate it.

1772
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,460
I felt it.

1773
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,460
I think he meant it.

1774
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,460
He said sorry.

1775
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,460
I think he meant his apology.

1776
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,460
I just don't think he understands

1777
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,460
the gravity of what he's done.

1778
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,460
And I think this is why I wanted him to know.

1779
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,460
I want him to see it.

1780
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,460
I want to show, not tell.

1781
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,460
Okay?

1782
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,460
The fiction is one major thing.

1783
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,460
Her friend, my Marie's friends,

1784
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
I mean, could you really call them friends, though?

1785
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,460
I mean, could you call them friends?

1786
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,460
No, Marie, could you call them...

1787
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,460
No, no, no, please.

1788
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,460
I mean, these people are terrible anyway.

1789
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,460
Yes.

1790
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,460
You know, fuck them.

1791
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,460
But it's not that.

1792
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,460
It's Marlo.

1793
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,460
Because this is a...

1794
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,460
You have two kids, so you know it's like

1795
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,460
going to school, having play dates,

1796
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,460
and kids playing with other kids, right?

1797
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,460
Yep.

1798
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,460
You know the parents interact with each other.

1799
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,460
It's a social thing.

1800
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,460
Yep.

1801
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,460
Right?

1802
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,460
So when a parent is ostracized,

1803
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,460
the kid is ostracized.

1804
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,460
Yeah, I definitely know what you mean.

1805
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,460
And that breaks my heart to hear that.

1806
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,460
And never before that.

1807
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,460
But that is a direct consequence of your act.

1808
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,460
Well, that makes me feel awful.

1809
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,460
Well, I'm glad you did.

1810
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,460
It makes me feel awful.

1811
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,460
Look, the...

1812
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,460
But I have a few choices.

1813
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,460
You can do something about it,

1814
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,460
but you cannot do anything about it.

1815
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,460
What would you like me to do?

1816
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,460
What I would like you to do is I'd like you

1817
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,460
to rewrite this problem.

1818
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,460
You'd like me to rewrite the article?

1819
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,460
Yeah.

1820
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,460
Well, that's not really the way we roll.

1821
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,460
I mean, I don't care.

1822
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,460
I don't care how you roll.

1823
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,460
This is what I like.

1824
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,460
You ask me what I like.

1825
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,460
I would like you to...

1826
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,460
I don't know.

1827
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,460
I'd like you to keep going.

1828
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,460
I'd like you to rewrite the article.

1829
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,460
I'd like you to make a statement.

1830
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,460
A...

1831
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,460
Marlo.

1832
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,460
Because this is a...

1833
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,460
You have two kids,

1834
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,460
so you know it's like going to school,

1835
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,460
having play dates,

1836
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,460
and kids playing with other kids, right?

1837
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,460
Yep.

1838
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,460
You know the parents interact with each other,

1839
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,460
so it's a social thing.

1840
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,460
Yep.

1841
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,460
Right?

1842
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,460
So when a parent is ostracized,

1843
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,460
the kid is ostracized.

1844
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,460
Get money from Ray Van.

1845
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,460
Yay!

1846
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,460
Sponsorship.

1847
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,460
You know, I was on a boat with McAfee,

1848
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,460
and he stole my Ray Vans.

1849
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,460
He wouldn't give them back to me,

1850
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,460
and he said the same fucking thing.

1851
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,460
Really?

1852
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,460
That's weird.

1853
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,460
And Ray Van was a sponsor,

1854
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,460
so I'm sure they enjoyed it,

1855
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,460
but it never aired, so...

1856
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,460
What's your status?

1857
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,460
We'll call Ray Van.

1858
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,460
Yeah, I...

1859
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,460
I definitely know what you mean,

1860
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,460
and that breaks my heart to hear that.

1861
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,460
And never before.

1862
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,460
But that is a direct consequence of your act.

1863
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,460
Well, that makes me feel awful.

1864
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,460
Well, I'm glad.

1865
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,460
Who is Nengar?

1866
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,460
You're right.

1867
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,460
It makes me feel awful.

1868
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,460
I am...

1869
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,460
Look, I have a few choices.

1870
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,460
You can do something about it,

1871
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,460
or you can not.

1872
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,460
What would you like me to do?

1873
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,460
What I would like you to do is

1874
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,460
I'd like you to rewrite this properly.

1875
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,460
You'd like me to rewrite the article?

1876
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,460
Yeah.

1877
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,460
Well, that's not really the way to do it.

1878
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,460
I don't care how you roll.

1879
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,460
This is what I like.

1880
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,460
You ask me what I would like.

1881
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,460
I would like you...

1882
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,460
I would like you to rewrite the article.

1883
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,460
I would like you to make a statement,

1884
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,460
a public fucking apology.

1885
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,460
Not on Twitter.

1886
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,460
Make it a little more public than that.

1887
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,460
Well, Val,

1888
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,460
I would like you to go over your own fucking article,

1889
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,460
or forensically like I did,

1890
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,460
and say this is where I was wrong.

1891
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,460
This is where I was right.

1892
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,460
This is where I apologize for it.

1893
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,460
This is what I've done.

1894
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,460
I would like you to say,

1895
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,460
you know what?

1896
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,460
I was careless with people.

1897
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,460
I was careless with my source.

1898
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,460
I was careless with my friend.

1899
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,460
I was careless.

1900
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,460
I fucked up.

1901
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,460
And I didn't think about

1902
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,460
how this would affect other people.

1903
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,460
I didn't realize that I, David,

1904
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,460
had a voice that few people do.

1905
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,460
And that's the New York Times.

1906
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,460
And this is not just a rinky-dinky paper

1907
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,460
in the middle of fucking Swaziland.

1908
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,460
This is the New York Times.

1909
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,460
And to put a character assassination piece

1910
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,460
on the front of the fucking New York Times, man.

1911
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,460
There's a lot of power.

1912
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,460
And you wielded that power,

1913
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,460
very carelessly,

1914
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,460
out of your own self fucking interest.

1915
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,460
I disagree with that last one.

1916
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,460
Let me finish my sentence now.

1917
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,460
You wielded that power against me

1918
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,460
in a very selfish way.

1919
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,460
And carelessly.

1920
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,460
Because you were angry at me.

1921
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,460
You did not consider the effects

1922
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,460
that they would have on me, Marie,

1923
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,460
and Marlo in our lives.

1924
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,460
You were just filled with anger and rage.

1925
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,460
And you took it out on me.

1926
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,460
And the best way you knew how,

1927
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,460
I said fuck that.

1928
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,460
I got him out.

1929
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,460
New York Times.

1930
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,460
But you didn't consider how that would work.

1931
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
You know what?

1932
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,460
What's frightening means that you did consider that.

1933
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,460
And you knew what the consequences would be.

1934
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,460
That's what scares me.

1935
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,460
And that's why I had to double down the others.

1936
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,460
And this is just part one.

1937
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,460
It's your imagination at school.

1938
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,460
We went to...

1939
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,460
Sorry, that was for vote here.

1940
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,460
No, I'm sorry.

1941
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,460
We went most recently to a parent-teacher conference.

1942
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,460
And my future ex-husband

1943
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,460
starts quoting you and asking Val to leave.

1944
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,460
Yeah.

1945
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,460
Screaming at him in front of everybody.

1946
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,460
And he had to leave.

1947
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,460
And he leaves half the time with Marlo.

1948
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,460
He couldn't stay.

1949
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,460
How could he stay?

1950
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,460
Well, the New York Times was wrong.

1951
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,460
I'm going to leave.

1952
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,460
The New York Times?

1953
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,460
It must be true.

1954
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,460
Yes.

1955
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,460
That's what we get.

1956
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,460
And Dragon Age and all of this.

1957
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,460
He's been going for a long time.

1958
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,460
You don't know what I mean.

1959
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,460
What we mean is that you're a part of the New York Times.

1960
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,460
You're a part of his life.

1961
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,460
Which means you could also be famous.

1962
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,460
It could also be cool.

1963
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,460
But just don't think about others too.

1964
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,460
You're in the New York Times.

1965
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,460
Because because you're part of his life,

1966
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,460
the council is you.

1967
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,460
You're right, Marlo.

1968
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,460
Think about others too.

1969
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,460
And you are right that it's really important to consider

1970
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,460
and remember the power that the Times wields.

1971
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,460
And especially when it's writing about the things that people...

1972
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,460
You're right.

1973
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,460
But David, there's a power in there.

1974
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,460
I know what you did to me.

1975
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:29,460
I thought it was just a nasty thing between us.

1976
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,460
But then I asked around a bit.

1977
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,460
And that wasn't the first one.

1978
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,460
Nobody was surprised.

1979
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,460
No one was surprised.

1980
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,460
I asked around.

1981
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,460
And you're not very well-liked amongst journals.

1982
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,460
It's fine.

1983
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,460
Oh, it's because you're so smart.

1984
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,460
Sources.

1985
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,460
It's because not only because of...

1986
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,460
Well, the fellow journalist, what I heard recently,

1987
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
he seemed to...

1988
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,460
One said, you brag a lot about your stories.

1989
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,460
Which I thought, okay, so what?

1990
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,460
So I moved to David Bragg's big fucking deal.

1991
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,460
And then he said something more like,

1992
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,460
well, he would steal stories from other people.

1993
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,460
I mean, he would get a lead that one guy would get.

1994
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,460
And then he would come in and snag it.

1995
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,460
And then sort of say, oh, but I'll give you the first byline.

1996
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,460
I'll give you the first word.

1997
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,460
And then he'll take it back.

1998
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,460
And I'm like, okay, so fine.

1999
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,460
So there's some under...

2000
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,460
I'm sure...

2001
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,460
I don't work in this business.

2002
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,460
I don't know how it goes.

2003
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,460
I'm sure there's sneaky stuff that happens.

2004
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,460
Everyone's out for their own best interest.

2005
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,460
And they want to get their stories out there.

2006
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,460
I get it.

2007
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,460
David's an ambitious guy.

2008
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,460
And I respect that about you.

2009
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,460
You're ambitious.

2010
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:36,460
And then I hear a story about a woman who came to you.

2011
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,460
And, oh, you found her.

2012
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,460
I'm not sure which one it was,

2013
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,460
but she was your source for sexual harassment suits

2014
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,460
or sexual harassment things going on at some major bank.

2015
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:49,460
And she came to you and she trusted you implicitly.

2016
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:54,460
And the way you wrote the story was in favor of

2017
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,460
the accuser, of the man who sexually harassed this woman.

2018
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,460
And she was decimated.

2019
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,460
She was decimated.

2020
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,460
I've never written a story about sexual harassment, I think.

2021
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,460
Are you sure?

2022
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,460
What?

2023
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,460
Not at the New York Times.

2024
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,460
No, I've never.

2025
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,460
Not once.

2026
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,460
But before the New York Times.

2027
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,460
Nope.

2028
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,460
Never have done it.

2029
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,460
Well, let's bring up the thing.

2030
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,460
You want to do that now?

2031
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,460
Yeah.

2032
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,460
Let's bring it up.

2033
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,460
Okay, look, Google...

2034
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,460
Google...

2035
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,460
I don't want...

2036
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,460
She said not to say her name.

2037
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,460
Is her name Lauren?

2038
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,460
I told you, I'm not saying her name.

2039
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,460
Is it for names Lauren?

2040
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,460
I can tell you what your...

2041
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,460
No, Lauren.

2042
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,460
Tell me.

2043
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,460
There it is.

2044
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,460
Absolutely not.

2045
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,460
You're saying...

2046
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,460
I'm not saying...

2047
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,460
Please can cut out this name.

2048
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,460
I'm not going to play a guessing game with this.

2049
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,460
If you guys want to...

2050
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,460
I'm asking you.

2051
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,460
If you will cut out the name.

2052
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,460
Yeah, yeah.

2053
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,460
So tell me the story.

2054
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,460
No, I'm not...

2055
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,460
What happened?

2056
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,460
Absolutely not.

2057
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,460
It's your chance to defend yourself.

2058
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,460
I'll take my chances on that.

2059
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,460
I'll take my chances on that.

2060
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,460
If you guys want to make an accusation of...

2061
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,460
I didn't make the accusation.

2062
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,460
If someone were to make an accusation, they're welcome.

2063
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,460
I am relaying information to you.

2064
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,460
I have...

2065
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,460
I have...

2066
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,460
Relay away or don't?

2067
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,460
I just did relay.

2068
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,460
Okay, well that's not...

2069
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,460
What you said is not true.

2070
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,460
So what's your side?

2071
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,460
I've never written a story about sexual harassment in a bank.

2072
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,460
So your facts are obviously a fundamental problem.

2073
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,460
No, well you seem...

2074
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,460
They're facts.

2075
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,460
You seem to know something about this.

2076
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,460
And they know you very well.

2077
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,460
If you...

2078
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,460
You said the name and then...

2079
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
Is that the right name?

2080
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,460
Yes, that's the right name.

2081
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,460
I'll tell you what happened.

2082
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,460
And more than one source.

2083
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,460
Is the right name?

2084
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,460
Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened.

2085
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,460
I was an editor on that story.

2086
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,460
There's other people who wrote that story, not me.

2087
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,460
And they didn't like the story.

2088
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:37,460
They thought that she didn't get the...

2089
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,460
They thought that Victor, the alleged perpetrator,

2090
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,460
got more sympathy than she did.

2091
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,460
Right.

2092
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,460
That was very...

2093
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,460
Was that?

2094
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,460
Yeah, it certainly wasn't at me.

2095
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,460
Because that's really interesting.

2096
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,460
Because he said he didn't write the story, but he was the editor.

2097
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,460
And being an editor is choosing what comes out.

2098
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,460
Right.

2099
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,460
If you say that...

2100
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,460
Right?

2101
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,460
Right?

2102
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,460
Right?

2103
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,460
Oh, you're looking at it again.

2104
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,460
So, okay.

2105
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,460
An editor from the story.

2106
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,460
There are other people who write the story.

2107
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,460
Again, that's his classic thing.

2108
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,460
Blaming others.

2109
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,460
One small.

2110
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,460
This story.

2111
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,460
No, I'm not...

2112
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,460
What happened?

2113
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,460
Absolutely...

2114
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,460
There's your chance to defend yourself.

2115
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,460
I'll take my chance on that.

2116
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,460
I'll take my chance on that.

2117
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,460
If you guys want to make an accusation...

2118
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,460
I didn't make the accusation.

2119
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,460
If someone wants to make an accusation, they're welcome.

2120
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,460
I am relaying information to you.

2121
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,460
I have...

2122
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,460
Relay away or done?

2123
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,460
I just did relay.

2124
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Okay, well, that's not...

2125
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,460
What you said is not true.

2126
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,460
That's interesting.

2127
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,460
He thinks we're accusing them.

2128
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,460
That's really weird.

2129
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,460
Okay.

2130
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,460
No, but he backed us on that.

2131
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,460
This is one of the things I really need context on.

2132
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,460
What do you mean?

2133
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,460
So, I don't understand.

2134
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,460
Because we have the footage of you calling the other reporters.

2135
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,460
Right?

2136
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,460
No.

2137
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,460
I'm going to have to call him too at some point and see what, you know, to be ethical,

2138
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,460
what we can use there.

2139
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,460
Okay.

2140
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,460
Yeah.

2141
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,460
Even though we asked him.

2142
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,460
We did not.

2143
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,460
But it's different when...

2144
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,460
He didn't know that it was me publicly disseminated, right?

2145
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,460
Okay.

2146
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,460
You did ask him.

2147
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,460
Technically, you're correct.

2148
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,460
Okay.

2149
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,460
Have you not come again?

2150
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,460
Yeah, I don't want to come again either.

2151
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,460
Can you just...

2152
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,460
I have to talk to a lawyer and see what the laws are on that.

2153
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,460
Because if I put it out, it might be different.

2154
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,460
That's all.

2155
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,460
If we say you're being recorded...

2156
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,460
Doesn't matter.

2157
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,460
Okay.

2158
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,460
I'm just going to check with the lawyer.

2159
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,460
They will know the answer.

2160
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,460
They will know the answer.

2161
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,460
It doesn't matter.

2162
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,460
If it's a yes, then I have things to consider.

2163
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,460
If it's a no, there's not a discussion.

2164
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,460
Are you okay?

2165
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,460
Because it's the one way...

2166
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,460
No, no.

2167
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,460
We're careful.

2168
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,460
It's okay.

2169
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,460
Listen.

2170
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,460
It doesn't matter.

2171
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,460
It's not a law thing.

2172
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,460
It doesn't matter.

2173
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,460
Because often...

2174
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,460
He's saying it's not a law thing.

2175
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,460
It's about...

2176
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,460
No, it is a law thing.

2177
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,460
It's a camera thing.

2178
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,460
I can check first if it's a law thing.

2179
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,460
And if it's not, then yes.

2180
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,460
There's like a...

2181
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,460
Why are you saying it doesn't matter?

2182
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,460
courtesy thing.

2183
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,460
Why are you saying it doesn't matter?

2184
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,460
It doesn't matter in the context of this conversation.

2185
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,460
Because the conversation...

2186
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,460
It matters in the context of the film.

2187
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,460
I want to put that in there.

2188
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,460
So, so you're clear.

2189
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,460
She said it was us two in New York.

2190
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,460
He said it doesn't matter.

2191
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,460
We're asking for it.

2192
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,460
This...

2193
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,460
Whether or not I can include that in the film,

2194
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,460
doesn't matter in the context of this conversation.

2195
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,460
What he told you matters.

2196
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,460
What he told you, I don't...

2197
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,460
Not quite clear on.

2198
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,460
What did that reporter tell you about this story

2199
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,460
that you're referencing with David?

2200
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,460
Okay.

2201
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,460
You were there.

2202
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,460
I know I was there.

2203
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,460
I don't understand it.

2204
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,460
How could I...

2205
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,460
Why did I get the recording?

2206
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,460
No, no.

2207
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,460
I've listened to the recording too.

2208
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,460
I'm asking you like what...

2209
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,460
I still don't fully grasp.

2210
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,460
First of all, I grasp what the reporter said.

2211
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:29,460
What I'm not grasping is why you said he thinks you're accusing them.

2212
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,460
Cusing him?

2213
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,460
Because I see that.

2214
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,460
We don't know either.

2215
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,460
That's what's interesting.

2216
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,460
Because he's so guilty.

2217
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,460
Because he's so fucking guilty.

2218
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,460
But he knows the story you're referencing.

2219
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,460
He gets it in a second.

2220
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,460
We blocked.

2221
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,460
We did not know anything except what we just said.

2222
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,460
We said, you were there.

2223
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,460
You heard it with us from...

2224
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,460
I know, I know.

2225
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,460
I'm just...

2226
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,460
That's what we know.

2227
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,460
That's it.

2228
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,460
There was something about a girl on a story.

2229
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,460
Okay.

2230
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,460
For a moment he was at the Wall Street Journal.

2231
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,460
A girl, he would use as a source about a sexual harassment case.

2232
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,460
That was at JP Morgan, right?

2233
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:57,460
Morgan Stanley.

2234
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,460
And Morgan Stanley, okay.

2235
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,460
And he used her as a source and he told her that, you know, it's going to be about her

2236
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,460
a terrible ordeal.

2237
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,460
Defending her.

2238
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,460
Defending her.

2239
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:08,460
He writes a story.

2240
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:12,460
The story takes sympathy for the accuser, the man.

2241
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,460
The bank.

2242
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,460
The Razor guy.

2243
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,460
And the bank.

2244
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,460
Which again...

2245
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,460
She's upset about that because he totally flipped on her.

2246
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,460
She's pissed off at him.

2247
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,460
He flipped on her.

2248
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,460
That's all we knew.

2249
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,460
We didn't even know her name.

2250
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,460
And he gave it...

2251
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,460
He just fucking gave it away.

2252
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,460
Made it.

2253
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,460
And Matt refused to give us her name because they're friends.

2254
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,460
Because they're friends.

2255
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,460
And Matt...

2256
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,460
Okay.

2257
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,460
That makes sense, I understand.

2258
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:36,460
Here is Matt, Matt's colleague.

2259
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,460
And also Matt is now in New York.

2260
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,460
But when this happened, he was living in London.

2261
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,460
Right.

2262
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,460
Okay.

2263
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,460
All makes sense.

2264
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,460
Thank you.

2265
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,460
No, no.

2266
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:47,460
What's the point?

2267
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:48,460
There's a second possibility, actually.

2268
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,460
Second possibility is this couldn't have been.

2269
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,460
Another story.

2270
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,460
Clearly fucking different.

2271
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,460
Yeah.

2272
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,460
I think it's the same story.

2273
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,460
That's...

2274
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,460
I'm think, but you're right.

2275
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,460
It could be.

2276
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,460
We should ask Matt if the name is...

2277
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,460
He might not tell you.

2278
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,460
Because he looks so angry.

2279
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,460
You're right.

2280
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,460
He's so angry that you're putting him on the spot.

2281
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,460
Yeah.

2282
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,460
He got red, too.

2283
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,460
His face blushed.

2284
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,460
David thought...

2285
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,460
He doesn't know what to do.

2286
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,460
He's stuck.

2287
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:11,460
Yeah.

2288
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,460
He's like on the trial.

2289
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,460
But he went straight to accusations.

2290
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,460
Yes, that's what I mean.

2291
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,460
The other trial.

2292
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,460
That's a show of guilt.

2293
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,460
Yes.

2294
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,460
That's interesting.

2295
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,460
Because we were just asking a question.

2296
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,460
So what happened?

2297
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,460
Yeah.

2298
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,460
We just...

2299
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,460
No, we weren't just asking a question.

2300
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,460
I mean...

2301
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,460
We were showing that there's history.

2302
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,460
Oh, pattern.

2303
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,460
The pattern of inferring sources.

2304
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,460
Yes.

2305
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:40,460
But I think this and Eric looking at that must be fucking on his head.

2306
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,460
Eric, the...

2307
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:45,460
But what did you think we were accusing him of?

2308
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,460
Of...

2309
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,460
What did you say?

2310
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,460
Of burning a source.

2311
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,460
Sexual harassment?

2312
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,460
No.

2313
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,460
No.

2314
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:52,460
Of not defending a victim.

2315
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,460
No.

2316
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,460
When you accuse somebody, you accuse them of something.

2317
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,460
A crime.

2318
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,460
Yes.

2319
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,460
Accusing that he didn't help the source.

2320
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:00,460
How is that a crime?

2321
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,460
Accusation.

2322
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:02,460
Accusation.

2323
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,460
Something is severe.

2324
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,460
No, that's not severe.

2325
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,460
You're accusing me of, right?

2326
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,460
You're accusing me of...

2327
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:07,460
Robert, what could it be?

2328
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,460
I don't know.

2329
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,460
Let's go backwards.

2330
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,460
I think I'm going to say it again.

2331
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,460
I did, I did.

2332
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,460
What?

2333
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:13,460
None of the New York Times.

2334
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,460
Okay.

2335
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,460
I do have to...

2336
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,460
I'm just kind.

2337
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,460
You know, I respect that.

2338
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,460
Hours.

2339
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:19,460
Hours.

2340
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,460
I'm just...

2341
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,460
And then I hear a story about a woman...

2342
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,460
And we have...

2343
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,460
Look how much time there is, right?

2344
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,460
One hour, right?

2345
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:26,460
One hour.

2346
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,460
Okay.

2347
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,460
So I...

2348
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,460
Over there.

2349
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,460
Recording.

2350
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,460
Who came to you...

2351
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,460
Recording.

2352
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,460
And...

2353
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,460
Oh, you found her.

2354
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,460
I'm not sure which one it was.

2355
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:39,460
But she was your source for sexual harassment suits or sexual harassment thing that's going

2356
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,860
on at some major bank.

2357
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,940
And she came to you and she trusted you implicitly.

2358
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:54,340
And the way you wrote the story was in favor of the accuser, of the man who sexually harassed

2359
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,340
this woman.

2360
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,340
What?

2361
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,340
What?

2362
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,340
What?

2363
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:02,340
I've never written a story about sexual harassment right back.

2364
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,340
Are you sure?

2365
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,340
What?

2366
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,340
Not at the New York Times.

2367
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,340
No, I've never.

2368
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,340
Not once.

2369
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,340
But before the New York Times.

2370
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,340
Nope.

2371
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,340
Never have done it.

2372
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,340
Well, let's bring up the thing.

2373
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,340
You want to do that now?

2374
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,340
Yeah.

2375
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,340
Let's bring it up.

2376
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,340
Okay.

2377
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,340
Look.

2378
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,340
Google...

2379
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,340
Google...

2380
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,340
I don't want...

2381
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,340
She said not to say her name.

2382
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,340
Is her name Lauren?

2383
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,340
I told you that.

2384
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,340
I'm not saying her name.

2385
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,340
Yeah.

2386
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,340
Yeah.

2387
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,340
Because if her name is Lauren, I can tell you what you're referring to.

2388
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,340
You're saying...

2389
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,340
Please can cut out this name.

2390
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:32,340
I'm not going to play a guessing game with this.

2391
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,340
If you guys want to...

2392
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,340
I'm asking...

2393
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:35,340
We will cut out the name.

2394
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,340
Yeah, yeah, I'm confused.

2395
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,340
So tell me the story.

2396
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,340
No, I'm not...

2397
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,340
What happened?

2398
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,340
Absolutely...

2399
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,340
Defend yourself.

2400
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,340
I'll take my chances on that.

2401
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,340
I'll take my chances on that.

2402
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,340
If you guys want to make an accusation...

2403
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,340
I didn't make the accusation.

2404
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,340
If some of them are making an accusation, they're welcome.

2405
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,340
I am relaying information to you.

2406
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,340
I have...

2407
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,340
I don't think you think so.

2408
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,340
Relay away or don't.

2409
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,340
I just did.

2410
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,340
I don't think you think so.

2411
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,340
What you said is not true.

2412
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,340
So what's your side?

2413
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,340
I've never written a story about sexual harassment in the bank.

2414
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,340
That's my side.

2415
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,340
Okay.

2416
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,340
So your facts are obviously fundamentally wrong.

2417
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,340
No.

2418
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,340
They're facts.

2419
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,340
See, you seem to know something about this.

2420
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,340
And they know you very well.

2421
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,340
If you...

2422
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,340
You said the name and then you said...

2423
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,340
Is that the right name?

2424
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,340
If that's the right name, I'll tell you what happened.

2425
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,340
What happened?

2426
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,340
It's the right name.

2427
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,340
It's the right name?

2428
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,340
Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened.

2429
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,340
I was in a...

2430
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,340
I was in a...

2431
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,340
I was in a...

2432
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,340
I was in a...

2433
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,340
I was in a...

2434
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,340
I was in a...

2435
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,340
I was in a...

2436
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,340
I was in a...

2437
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,340
I was in a...

2438
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,340
I was in a...

2439
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,340
I was in...

2440
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,340
I was in...

2441
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,340
I was in a...

2442
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,340
I was in...

2443
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,340
I was in a...

2444
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,340
I was in a...

2445
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,340
I was in a...

2446
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,340
ochita at the time.

2447
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,340
Something like this.

2448
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,340
But it's the right name.

2449
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,340
Okay, yeah, I'll tell you what happened.

2450
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,180
I was an editor on that story.

2451
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,340
There's other people who wrote that story, not me.

2452
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,340
Thank you.

2453
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,340
And they didn't like the story.

2454
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,340
They thought that she didn't get the...

2455
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,340
They thought that this is the...

2456
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,340
Or the alleged perpetrator...

2457
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,340
Got more sympathy than she did.

2458
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,340
Yes.

2459
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,340
That was why I was pissed off.

2460
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,340
Yeah.

2461
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,340
And then certainly, it wasn't me.

2462
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:48,340
Right, the story there was.

2463
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,340
I had nothing to do with the reporting or writing of the story.

2464
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:55,300
by the story by the way but there's but look this is journalism is hard Val and

2465
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,660
we get things wrong we do I do personally journalists do all the time

2466
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:07,260
and we it's an imperfect craft and you're gonna be able to find I'm telling

2467
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:13,100
look for all the corrections I've had no you're gonna find some bad ones I'm

2468
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,820
showing you a pattern okay I don't care about this corrections this is a

2469
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,820
better because there's another person tell me my pattern to talk about her

2470
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,980
lips what did you tell time you told her I'll just summarize because you don't

2471
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:29,820
know what I'm getting at but do you tell Tammy that you know you will take care

2472
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:35,020
of her that you will not you will keep her from the the wilds of other

2473
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:39,900
journalists you will have this tension you will you will be more hands-on as

2474
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,540
someone to protect her from what was the the repercussions of what was going to

2475
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:50,660
happen right because only David could do this because David is the savior here

2476
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:56,180
come and save the day and make your life let me tell you what I don't know

2477
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:01,340
what you've heard or who you've heard it from but obviously I'm and I don't

2478
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,140
even know why I'm responding to them where you just being big but I'll tell

2479
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:12,380
you because I Tammy did something the Tammy did something that's very

2480
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,420
crazy I tracked I've heard through the grapevine in Deutsche Bank's Jacksonville

2481
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:22,820
Florida offices there was a woman who had voiced concerns about Trump loans or

2482
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,460
Trump transactions and Kushner transactions and had then been fired

2483
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:32,300
as a result of raising those concerns I tracked Tammy down down over a period of

2484
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,300
weeks I convinced her to go on the record

2485
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:49,180
because I have it you don't know but I have it on audited because at the same

2486
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:54,660
day I was talking to the FBI they were here so and you called let me let me

2487
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,620
just if you don't mind I don't actually I just don't know why you're telling me

2488
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:07,340
it's something good and I know it happened the Tammy agreed after quite a while

2489
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:11,820
spending time with me and talking to me to do something very courageous which was

2490
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:17,500
to go on the record she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and

2491
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,940
decided after talking with her husband after me talking with her husband this

2492
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:24,580
is something she wanted to do it was extremely risky for her to do extremely

2493
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:33,060
extremely courageous and that I mean that's the story that's like we spent

2494
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,580
what must have been hours I think talking about the follow-up what the likely

2495
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,900
follow-up would be from this what the implications would be how other media

2496
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:45,020
would be pursuing her how Trump supporters would be so important because

2497
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,780
this is also what I'm going to ask Scott about tomorrow and so my record

2498
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:55,260
she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and decided to meet and

2499
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:01,740
she's Jackson, Florida about to meet the source I'm very excited about it because I

2500
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:07,380
haven't you don't know but I have it on audited because at the same day I was

2501
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:13,060
talking to the FBI they were here so and you called let me let me just if you

2502
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,420
don't mind I don't actually I just don't know why you're telling me something

2503
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:24,580
didn't happen I said I know it happened the Tammy agreed after quite a while

2504
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:29,060
spending time with me and talking to me to do something very courageous which was

2505
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:34,740
to go on the record she agreed to a photo shoot and it to and she agreed and

2506
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:38,100
decided after talking with her husband after me talking with her husband but

2507
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,820
this is something she wanted to do and it was extremely risky for her to do

2508
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:48,380
extremely risky extremely courageous and it that I mean that's the story that's

2509
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:54,300
like we spent what must have been hours I think talking about the follow-up what

2510
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,580
the likely follow-up would be from this what the implications would be how other

2511
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:02,540
media would be pursuing her how Trump supporters would be supporting her how

2512
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:15,100
long and she's a very different version of the version says that she felt

2513
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:22,020
unprotected she felt that you left her out I find that very hard to believe but

2514
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,220
and she certainly has never communicated that to me she's communicated

2515
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:32,180
something to you differently look Tammy is a courageous strong person and I feel

2516
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:36,100
like she wants to speak for herself I totally respect that I'm not really

2517
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:42,940
interested in communicating with my three I am the point is I'm bringing

2518
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:48,420
showing you a pattern here okay tell me about Tom Hays no Tom Hays let's talk

2519
01:13:48,420 --> 01:14:00,700
about Tom Hays yes about you are the most intense about you are the most

2520
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:05,820
intense longest lasting active source relations ever had Tom Hays is the

2521
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:13,420
second longest and second most intense Tom and I talk regularly and he regularly

2522
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:19,500
yes this is what I meant she said the most intense longest lasting active

2523
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:23,380
source relations ever had Tom Hays is the second longest and second most intense

2524
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:32,220
Tom and I talk regularly and he regularly yes when I met you said we

2525
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:36,580
don't talk at all only to the lawyer I said why yeah that's a bit of a thing

2526
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:42,840
well I don't know no I'm actually honestly what is that there is what does

2527
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:48,020
that mean because yeah when you met yeah he said what I remember I was in the

2528
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:51,820
apartment in Culver City I remember walking through the how long ago since

2529
01:14:51,820 --> 01:15:00,660
this is 2018 and I was walking through all the dirty clothes on the floor picking

2530
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:05,740
them up David came in still we can help Tom because you give him some of the

2531
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,260
Deutsche Bank files to show that he because I was still reading the book in

2532
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:12,500
the middle of the audio book of this library book and I was like oh dude this

2533
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:16,940
thing about Deutsche Bank we can give him a good lawyer or Tom all the files that

2534
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:21,140
we have and they can help them reduce the sentence and he says well I don't

2535
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:25,060
think that's gonna work I said why so well we don't really talk anymore so why

2536
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:28,900
what happened instead of that of falling out he said the wife doesn't like me at

2537
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,300
all Sarah yeah yeah that's what the text referred to that's what the text

2538
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,380
referred to yeah okay okay that's what I need clarity up yeah and I said well

2539
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,660
what I said when I get into impossible to talk to my I can only send an email I

2540
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:45,580
can't actually comment so I'm gonna I probably will call I can't guarantee it

2541
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,580
he said David said to me that I cannot call Tom like because it's only through

2542
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,900
a lawyer because as he's in he's in jail so through a lawyer I get an email the

2543
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,660
email it goes to the lawyer the lawyer then communicates Tom somehow you still

2544
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,220
in jail I don't know if you're sure to look it up but I think you got it

2545
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:08,420
since reduced by from 14 years to seven years so yes that's still me in jail but

2546
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:12,820
I can call and I remember yeah I know David told me he would give him his

2547
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:17,740
contact he's probably giving the lawyers contact we'll see lawyer yeah call

2548
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:21,860
it's texting Tom I'm gonna say I want Tom's contact you want to hear oh yeah

2549
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:26,180
yeah you said you're giving Tom's contact yeah I'm just telling you I get

2550
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:33,900
them from what I'm gonna do and this is dog twice there's a the proof twice

2551
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:39,220
because I also asked Val how can I contact Tom and he said we come because

2552
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:42,640
David had it falling out okay they're not talking but why did you want to

2553
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,620
contact and here you look at the files because yeah I had a Deutsche Bank shit

2554
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,220
and I thought I could get a sentence reduced we can show that he how we help

2555
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,380
here though because the Deutsche Bank hold on Deutsche Bank trader was doing

2556
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:56,300
more illegal shit than Tom so Tom wasn't he was taken to fall for all these

2557
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,940
other guys doing shit and Tom just didn't care David told me like Tom didn't

2558
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:03,540
carry like Tom's out to destroy the world like he's a really care like he's in

2559
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:09,500
jail so how can I care he's in fucking jail I know he's telling me like Tom

2560
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,820
is an autistic like savant sort of thing and that he's out there and he wants

2561
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:17,780
the whole world to burn down not just the banks it's like what it didn't make

2562
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,060
any sense so he just shot down the idea of helping me helping this guy I could

2563
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,940
have that was when they were in the falling out yeah since game regain

2564
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:27,100
contact no but doesn't we don't know the truth it's a falling out either way

2565
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:34,060
David said that no I said here's a bunch of shit let's assume let's go by as

2566
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:37,420
well don't know the point is what it's more important now I realized that

2567
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:41,580
because imagine if you're in jail and some writer decides your life for you

2568
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:46,740
he's like fucking Davis decide no this don't give it to him it's not even give

2569
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:49,860
a trot well there's a lot of steps that would have to be proven but it's

2570
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:57,340
hypothetically could happen but also the point is how David interacts with

2571
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:02,760
his life yes how hard is it for me to give him a bunch of files and David

2572
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,340
hand those files to the lawyer it's not difficult especially when you want to

2573
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:11,380
supposedly help your soul right so it's like what the fuck he refuses he didn't

2574
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,820
well there's a fine line I'm not saying that you got it wrong or right I'm saying

2575
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:21,060
that the only way to really know is talk to Tom and say you know you're talking

2576
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,600
about different things on what we're talking about is this did David have a

2577
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,140
falling out with Tom and did he then regain access that's the question that's

2578
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,700
for you that's your question my question I don't have a question I'm just I'm

2579
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,980
pointing out I'm a member of realization that this happened okay that prompt

2580
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:42,420
can I interject because I am now imagining how many people I've reached out

2581
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:47,220
to David to talk to Val and how many times has he blocked that communication

2582
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:55,900
the way he did for Tom Tom and I are in regular touch he Tom is a

2583
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:04,980
complicated person and it look Tom was another courageous person who is I feel

2584
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:08,020
like I've done right by if he wants to say something different or if his wife

2585
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:12,380
Sarah wants to say something different I respect for both of them but I

2586
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:18,220
stand by my handling of Tom Hayes I certainly stand by my handling of Tammy

2587
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:23,420
McFadden the situation you're referring to on this story I edited with Lauren is

2588
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:28,220
I also stand by my handling of that although I recognize that that writing

2589
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:33,620
with sexual harassment is very hard and it's very hard and you know what and I'm

2590
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:37,020
not saying that's what happened with Lauren but we make mistakes the New

2591
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:42,740
York Times does the journalist do I do there's and I honestly like part of the

2592
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:47,740
that of this it feels a little ridiculous to me is that I can own my

2593
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:54,980
mistakes you know I make mistakes in my professional life my personal life we

2594
01:19:54,980 --> 01:20:00,340
all do yes and yeah well and I'm owning that so I don't feel like that's

2595
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:04,700
other than mine and say anything you've made a mistake with you said you stand by

2596
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:08,380
the story with Lauren you said you stand by the story with Tammy and fucking Tom

2597
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:18,060
too and Tom's 14 years in jail now does your help look I think you're presenting

2598
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,220
you a pattern that what you're talking about is great but it's irrelevant my

2599
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:24,420
point is that there's a pattern of people there was your sources that said

2600
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:29,460
that you they've been left out high and dry to hang because of you and they do

2601
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:33,780
not have kind of things to say about okay and you have co-workers that say not

2602
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:40,220
that specifically they just more address the ambition and you're sort of wanting

2603
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:43,980
to put yourself in the story this is this is my favorite response when I said

2604
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,940
talking about David said well and this is most politically correct response I

2605
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:53,460
get well David has his own style which I respect greatly but you know I just I'm

2606
01:20:53,460 --> 01:21:00,180
not I'm not it's not my style to put myself in this time it's not my style

2607
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:05,420
to put myself in this time thank you that's all I have to say I can't tell

2608
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:10,300
you anymore let's talk again that's what I got and I have almost respect for my

2609
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,060
colleagues if some of them have issues with how I've done stuff they have not

2610
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:18,140
expressed but they're definitely in terms of dependence and you were in the story

2611
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:22,180
more do I mean isn't this story you wish you were the store now I think it's

2612
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:25,140
exceptionally awkward for the general but you make yourself the story they're

2613
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:31,060
changing well in this one me and my whistleblower and this one I definitely

2614
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:37,860
did it's in the town you're in my whistleblower like you own me yeah

2615
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:43,220
yeah sorry I've been trying to say something about Tommy also I think it's

2616
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:49,260
interesting that I think you've got a question

2617
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:59,980
you think of the golden yeah and oh God yes somebody you've been working with

2618
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:05,740
if I'm correct me for long for as long as you work as well and it seems like you

2619
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:14,580
vote a piece about Tommy based I don't know whether proof of what you were

2620
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:23,940
recording but what to me was striking is that you have worked with Val for so

2621
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:30,860
many years it was basically second wife and it's provided with all the

2622
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:35,940
document all the receipt all the proof that you needed and that was not enough

2623
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:40,860
but Tommy told you something and that was enough in her word that's exactly

2624
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:50,220
brilliant thank you yes yes oh but tell me it's great and I'm no reason genius

2625
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:54,420
you know why because that is exactly right you go down the floor you talk to

2626
01:22:54,420 --> 01:23:00,340
Tammy you come back with no documentary evidence nothing at all but her work and

2627
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:05,180
you publish that and the world listens to it's like oh well it's a New York times

2628
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:10,300
it must be true I come to you with hundreds of thousands of fucking

2629
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:17,980
documents and futile documents you're fucking futile all right and then you do

2630
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:22,300
this to me and you discredit me but let my documents and speak to themselves

2631
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:26,020
well that was a fucking asshole but the documents are speaking to themselves

2632
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:29,660
sometimes and then you have absolutely nothing with Tammy you come back with

2633
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:32,860
these stars reports alleged stars reports you don't even think about

2634
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,860
Susan Scarrett you probably didn't think about it right now

2635
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:41,860
Susan Scarrett is the one that fucking has me fucking David think about you

2636
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,380
could have gotten them from there but no it was enough for you to get a word from

2637
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:49,980
Tammy and then spin it as he did into this big huge story which Tammy ended up

2638
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:53,860
suffering from and still does today she didn't want all this publicity she's

2639
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:57,900
one people howling here she's a lot like anyone into this with her eyes wide open

2640
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:04,020
that's what she there perhaps she did but the way I mean again she's not here

2641
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:09,180

2642
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:16,440
can't tell you the admiration I have and you know what Tammy was here saying

2643
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:20,940

2644
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:26,940

2650
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:59,220
please please please he does he gets it he gets it it's David do you understand

2651
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:02,940
what's going on here do you understand what we're trying to tell you yes it

2652
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:08,300
seems in a way I'm being targeted by you and you target me now I could there's

2653
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:13,260
millions of little we've been armchair psychology just for a long time and I

2654
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:18,180
took it back to the beginning when I first met you when you're stalking me

2655
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:22,820
for about a month and a half and I kept saying no no no back the fuck off until

2656
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,380
I until I was at David Grant David Grant I said I mean you don't you don't know

2657
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:31,580
this about Florida to you but I said David Grant I said David I don't know

2658
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,700
anything about journalists you're the only journalist you're not even David

2659
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,500
Grant at the time was no longer a journalist he was the he wrote lots of

2660
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:44,660
easy now he's a superstar writer but at the time he was willing to help me

2661
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,780
because he knew journalists you know deal with them I said there's this one guy

2662
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:51,540
that's fucking driving me nuts and David Enrich or Enrich they called you

2663
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,500
Enrich still at the time because they pronounce it the proper German German

2664
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:59,780
but sorry that's just an old joke you're supposed to laugh I'm not finding

2665
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:05,140
this amusing I know it's great for me though but anyway please so I said David

2666
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,620
can you get this fucking guy off my back he's driving me crazy he's sending

2667
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:13,020
letters to my mother my little sisters I mean that everybody is he's bothering

2668
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:16,700
us can you help me with it and David says yes of course let me let me do my

2669
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:22,820
best but David Grant is a timid kind guy he does not like to confrontation and

2670
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:26,660
he didn't and he feels pretty bad about it but he didn't come he didn't get you

2671
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:30,940
off my back and you kept pushing and he kept pushing and he kept pushing and

2672
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:35,260
then you called one day and he said Val I'm gonna write the story whether you

2673
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:40,540
like it or not you can say something you can give me some documents you can tell

2674
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:44,140
me some more about your father's relationship to Anshun or all that shit

2675
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:49,740
okay or I'm just gonna publish one of the fuck I want and I was like you know fuck you remember this

2676
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:57,740
conversation and then I hung up and then you published Bill Brooksman kills

2677
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:05,380
himself amid anxiety and fear into library bro library bro right at the

2678
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:09,500
time I'm like what the fuck's a library right I don't know shit about finance I

2679
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:13,300
taught myself finance probably last five years okay at that time I didn't know

2680
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:18,060
what the fuck I was talking about it took me a few years and I really should

2681
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:21,300
have thought through a little bit better but I didn't but I was such a fool at

2682
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:26,580
that time but that was exactly the time you were writing your book on live or

2683
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:32,740
exactly at that time yes it was because you at well you want proof of three

2684
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:35,820
months later you're asking me I'm writing a book on a library Val do you can

2685
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:38,980
you search these documents to your father's father's right you wrote me a

2686
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:43,940
list to search for specifically a book no I'm thinking Jesus did David just use

2687
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:49,740
my father's name to promote his book on live or that's what I'm thinking and I

2688
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:53,820
couldn't believe it I started writing a book in the summer no one knows why

2689
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:57,740
anyone kills themselves what gives you the right to say this is why Bill Brooksman

2690
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,060
kills himself what gives you the right to say that's not what that article said

2691
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:04,900
that's what the title says literally that's what the heading said

2692
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,900
read it who's got it

2693
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,900
we're looking at the internet

2694
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,900
it's not everyone's fun

2695
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,900
okay tell me what's

2696
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,900
I would like you to know who the

2697
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,900
by-lines are on this article

2698
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,900
take a look

2699
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,900
well tell you

2700
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,900
my name is on there and I'm not sure it is

2701
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,900
it's the 4th of 4 by-lines

2702
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,900
okay library Brooksman

2703
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,900
I'll show you

2704
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,900
and my dad has nothing to do with library

2705
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,900
and you know that

2706
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,900
so this is important to you because you don't know

2707
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,900
yeah I need context

2708
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,900
so he when he wrote this story

2709
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,900
I was a Sausalito I remember

2710
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,900
and David

2711
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,900
he was the one calling me

2712
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,900
no one else did no one else called me

2713
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,900
he was constantly calling me asking me to comment

2714
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,900
asking me to comment I said no no no

2715
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,900
and he says well I'm gonna publish it tomorrow then it's your last chance after a week of this

2716
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,900
said no it's nothing I can't

2717
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,900
no comment the story comes out

2718
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,900
and it says written by David Enbridge

2719
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,900
and Jenny Strasberg

2720
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,900
had a third thing

2721
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
let's look it up right now

2722
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,900
and now he's saying oh I'm not the only one

2723
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,900
yeah so he's trying to blame someone else on it

2724
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,900
and it's clearly him

2725
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,900
and also his book was on library

2726
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,900
weeks later

2727
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,900
he would say hey look up these things for me

2728
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,900
I'm writing a book on library

2729
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,900
look up these keywords in your dad's

2730
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,900
files

2731
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,900
see Brooksman

2732
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,900
suicide

2733
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,900
um

2734
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,900
this is the library

2735
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,900
this is the keywords

2736
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,900
it's not Deutsche Bank

2737
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,900
executive dismissal

2738
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,900
library fixing is conspiracy

2739
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,900
no no

2740
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,900
it's uh

2741
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,900
here executive who committed suicide anxious

2742
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,900
admits Deutsche Bank probes

2743
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,900
that's what's in the title

2744
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,900
executive who committed suicide anxious

2745
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,900
he said it's not in the title

2746
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,900
Deutsche Bank probes

2747
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,900
former top banker was involved in investigations

2748
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,900
he felt abandoned by his colleagues

2749
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,900
by dogs

2750
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,900
that's what he said in the book

2751
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,900
he keeps up that same thing

2752
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,900
Jenny Strasberg

2753
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,900
what does that mean?

2754
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,900
nothing

2755
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,900
I'm just wondering if that was his excuse

2756
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,900
my name is last on the byline

2757
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,900
so it's um

2758
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,900
it's not really me

2759
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,900
like the sexual harassment

2760
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,900
I was the editor

2761
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,900
not really me

2762
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,900
like Kenny

2763
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,900
so Aika's on it and David Enrich

2764
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,900
and um the first book is about library

2765
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,900
and that's what he's tried to do

2766
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,900
promote

2767
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,900
use his source to promote the book

2768
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,900
like Schrocker just said he subconsciously said

2769
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,900
it was me

2770
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,900
what?

2771
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,900
that he subconsciously said yes I did

2772
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,900
he did he said yes I did

2773
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,900
it sounds like he said no I didn't

2774
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,900
but we'll review that close to this

2775
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,900
and by the way just so you guys know why

2776
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,900
I thought about this comfortable

2777
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,900
reviewing this with you

2778
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,900
one because of David leaking the text to me

2779
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,900
and I feel

2780
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,900
I'm not a print journalist

2781
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,900
and I'm not a um

2782
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,900
of writing a book

2783
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,900
and I understand how both of those things work

2784
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:10,900
I'm shooting a documentary in this case

2785
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,900
you're writing a book?

2786
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,900
no I'm saying I'm not writing a book for this

2787
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:16,900
and I'm not a print journalist

2788
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,900
I'm shooting a documentary

2789
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,900
and a documentary the great thing about it

2790
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:22,900
that's as close as you get to real life

2791
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,900
a representation

2792
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,900
so the fact that he leaked me the text

2793
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,900
and the fact that this is the daily's content

2794
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,900
I'm not reviewing any other footage with you

2795
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,900
I'm only reviewing this because I need context

2796
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,900
and to do it like where I question you

2797
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,900
like he would

2798
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,900
that's a print journalist

2799
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,900
that's not what I'm doing here

2800
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,900
and um

2801
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,900
yeah I don't like I'm gonna do a split screen

2802
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,900
in some instances so

2803
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,900
you know like old 70's movies

2804
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,900
I'm gonna say I'm stylizing that

2805
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,900
like that is what I'm thinking in my head

2806
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,900
so like you dress like this actually makes

2807
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,900
a big sense in that case

2808
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,900
and not in a funny way but like you know what I mean

2809
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:00,900
it's almost like you're taking the piss

2810
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,900
it's like having without knowing

2811
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,900
it's like you saying something

2812
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,900
him saying something and then like boof

2813
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,900
you know what I mean and it will pause one

2814
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,900
I like that idea

2815
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,900
that's actually an idea

2816
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,900
that people cannot refute

2817
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,900
I think it's like the one way

2818
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,900
facts don't matter in a lot of cases

2819
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,900
to at least convince someone these days

2820
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,900
which is terrible but so it is

2821
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,900
that sort of stuff well I mean if you put

2822
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,900
even Trump saying you know

2823
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,900
I didn't rape that baby

2824
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,900
and then you have him raping a baby

2825
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,900
people are gonna see him raping a baby

2826
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,900
even his supporters are gonna say okay yeah

2827
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,900
you probably rape that baby

2828
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,900
sorry he's the worst example possible

2829
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,900
terrible image man

2830
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,900
Trump just raping babies

2831
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,900
thank you for that image

2832
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,900
I want to point out something else

2833
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,900
oh really?

2834
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,900
that after this first day

2835
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,900
David is

2836
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,900
sending you an email

2837
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,900
to influence your documentary

2838
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:58,900
well he did influence everybody

2839
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,900
influences my documentary but maybe not the way

2840
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,900
he wanted right?

2841
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,900
yeah yeah

2842
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,900
I'm not gonna do that

2843
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,900
my job is

2844
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,900
hang on when you are not being

2845
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,900
commissioned by Val

2846
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,900
right no I mean

2847
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,900
Val's gonna kiss me already a couple of times

2848
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,900
you know but he's pretending

2849
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,900
that you are well of course

2850
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,900
cause it helps him but I saved the daily microphone

2851
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,900
the first thing I said is I'm not

2852
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,900
you know I'm not Val's crew

2853
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,900
I am my crew I asked you know

2854
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,900
I reached out to Val and he said yes

2855
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,900
go go go eat

2856
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,900

2857
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,900
go here

2858
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,900

2859
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,900
are you okay?

2860
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,900
oh no

2861
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,900
are you okay?

2862
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,900
no

2863
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,900
yeah I think they

2864
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,900
let me get them

2865
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,900
I'm amazed man

2866
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,900
you

2867
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,900
you

2868
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,900
okay

2869
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,900
thank you

2870
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,900
alright Steve's got some text

2871
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,900
Steve's really pissed off

2872
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,900
the reason he's going in

2873
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,900
and the more she ignores him

2874
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,900
the more

2875
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,900
the more you ignore me

2876
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,900
the closer I get

2877
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,900
you got a lovely singing voice

2878
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,900
look at you

2879
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,900
we got jam

2880
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,900
I forgot you played too

2881
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,900
alright what's your jam

2882
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,900
let me see this

2883
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,900
what's your play

2884
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,900
if you'll come back on

2885
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,900
I'm gonna waste time

2886
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,900
yeah cause I do have to go

2887
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,900
what's the other thing?

2888
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,900
wait Val hang on

2889
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,900
there's you've seen

2890
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,900
showed it to me

2891
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,900
you have the documents

2892
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,900
that his psychologist and his doctor

2893
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:42,900
wrote to the coroner

2894
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,900
that very clearly says that he expressed anxiety

2895
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,900
about the library investigation

2896
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,900
he expressed anxiety about a lot of things

2897
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,900
but you chose library

2898
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,900
because you were writing about library

2899
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,900
right?

2900
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,900
maybe subconsciously

2901
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,900
maybe didn't consciously

2902
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,900
explicitly this psychologist

2903
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,900
in the doctor's report cite

2904
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,900
the government investigations into library

2905
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,900
is what Bill, your father told them

2906
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,900
they cite a lot more than just that

2907
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,900
but you picked and she is the one that worked for you

2908
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,900
there you go

2909
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,900
there's the title

2910
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,900
executive is committed suicide

2911
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,900
anxious amid Deutsche Bank pros

2912
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,900
okay

2913
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,900
former top banker is involved in investigations

2914
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,900
investigations felt abandoned by colleagues

2915
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,900
he's a share

2916
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,900
Janice Strasberg, Dallas Turner

2917
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,900
Ikenning

2918
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,900
Ikenning

2919
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,900
what does that mean?

2920
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,900
well that means

2921
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,900
the by lines in general

2922
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,900
so the first by lines

2923
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,900
the person who did most of the work second

2924
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,900
so fourth is the most important

2925
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,900
I have to give them appropriate time

2926
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,900
because if I say to them

2927
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,900
when is the daily airing

2928
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,900
if you think it's mid-march

2929
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,900
I'll try to figure out but I can't bug them till mid-march

2930
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,900
I'll find out

2931
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,900
I told you guys I wouldn't

2932
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,900
proceed your airing

2933
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,900
but I also said that if you didn't air it

2934
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,900
all bets are off

2935
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,900
so give me an air date and give me a final air date

2936
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,900
and like I'm editing my film

2937
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,900
I'm giving you a courtesy because really

2938
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,900
I told you these were the stakes

2939
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,900
what did you tell me you were from

2940
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:16,900
where I was from?

2941
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,900
do they ask you like what were you doing?

2942
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,900
I'm starting a new company

2943
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,900
I told them very clearly

2944
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,900
I have my logos and stuff I'm ready to launch

2945
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,900
we're going to call it scanner

2946
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,900
that's good

2947
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,900
it's true too

2948
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,900
I have a contract in my clause

2949
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,900
that says if any of this shit gets messed up

2950
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,900
with the business until the new operating room is formed

2951
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,900
that I control the footage

2952
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,900
and I own it

2953
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:42,900
it's an independent film right now

2954
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,900
I know where I want to air it

2955
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,900
and on my new platform

2956
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,900
but I'm saying

2957
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,900
I still have a few things to get sorted out

2958
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,900
I missed what you said

2959
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,900
right after that

2960
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,900
15-20 seconds

2961
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,900
he's saying something

2962
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,900
maybe

2963
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,900
subconsciously

2964
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,900
I don't know

2965
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,900
the psychologist in the doctor's report

2966
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,900
cite the government investigations

2967
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,900
into the library as what Bill your father told them

2968
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,900
they cite a lot more than just that

2969
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,900
but you picked and she is the one that worked for you guys

2970
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,900
there you go

2971
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,900
there you go

2972
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,900
there's the title

2973
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,900
executive committed suicide anxious

2974
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,900
for top bankers involved

2975
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,900
investigation

2976
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:28,900
investigation is felt abandoned by colleagues

2977
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,900
this is Sherry

2978
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,900
Jenny Strasberg

2979
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,900
Giles Turner

2980
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,900
Ikenning

2981
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,900
and David Ennerich

2982
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,900
what does that mean

2983
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,900
well that means

2984
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:44,900
byline is in general

2985
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,900
so the first byline

2986
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,900
is the person who did most of the work

2987
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,900
so fourth is the least important

2988
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,900
so you were the least important

2989
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:54,900
so why did you call me

2990
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,900
and tell me you're going to write whatever you want

2991
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:58,900
I mean I obviously never said that

2992
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,900
but you're the editor right

2993
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,900
at the time I was a reporter

2994
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:04,900
you were not an editor at the Wall Street Journal this time

2995
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,900
I think my title was European

2996
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,900
banking editor but that was kind of like a reporting editor

2997
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,900
so these were not your subordinates

2998
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,900
you did not work for you

2999
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,900
I think maybe Jenny

3000
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,900
who's the first one named

3001
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,900
Jenny is the first one

3002
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,900
I stand by the story

3003
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,900
we can just skip

3004
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,900
you stand by the story

3005
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,900
what do you think someone would read this

3006
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,900
if they don't know anything about

3007
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,900
you know how newspapers are

3008
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,900
I don't remember

3009
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,900
here's the question

3010
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:36,900
he says

3011
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,900
that he was a reporter editor

3012
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,900
but his title was European banking editor

3013
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:42,900
an editor writes the headlines

3014
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,900
a reporter does not write the headlines

3015
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:46,900
so if you're a reporter

3016
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,900
a lot of times the reporter will get pissed

3017
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,900
because the headline

3018
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:52,900
is not indicative of the story

3019
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,900
or they feel so

3020
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,900
yes an editor writes the headlines

3021
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,900
now there's some blurry lines there

3022
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,900
but what I'm saying is if he was both the editor

3023
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,900
and the reporter

3024
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,900
there's no way around him knowing what the headline would have been

3025
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:06,900
and that's something that

3026
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,900
you know that's better for me

3027
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:10,900
to talk to him about because I am an editor

3028
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,900
and was an editor and I can say to him

3029
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,900
how do you explain that because I know for a fact

3030
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,900
in the New York Times

3031
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:18,900
I'm sure reporters have influence

3032
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,900
and perhaps your standards

3033
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,900
well first of all what's your standard now

3034
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,900
what's your public editor say about how you present

3035
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,900
what the headline might be to the reporters

3036
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,900
and sometimes there's so little time

3037
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:30,900
between finishing the story and writing the headline

3038
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,900
they don't get to see it

3039
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,900
I don't know what your policy is

3040
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,900
what's your policy

3041
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,900
it's probably different with every case

3042
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,900
but a lot of times

3043
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,900
maybe they don't see it

3044
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,900
they're just so antiquated

3045
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,900
that the headline may be laid out

3046
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,900
and the story is still there

3047
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,900
and so they don't see it until it goes to print

3048
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,900
at the same time I'm pretty sure they have a big screen

3049
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,900
in the New York Times, I know they do

3050
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:56,900
that every day the entire day

3051
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,900
as the layout person makes the paper

3052
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,900
you see it in real time

3053
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,900
I believe that's the case

3054
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,900
I know the screen is there and I believe it's in real time

3055
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,900
Is that the Wall Street Journal though at the time

3056
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,900
they would have a similar system

3057
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,900
just probably not projected against the wall

3058
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,900
the Wall Street is

3059
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,900
what's that?

3060
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,900
I was looking for this ashram

3061
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,900
I know it's in my left the whole time

3062
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:20,900
but you're saying

3063
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,900
there's no way around it

3064
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,900
he might have an explanation

3065
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,900
but even so he says I stand by my story

3066
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,900
so let's say you go to New York

3067
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,900
and he says I stand by my story

3068
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,900
that's what he said

3069
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,900
the headline is important

3070
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,900
and you know this as an editor

3071
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,900
but the headline is usually that anyone

3072
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,900
72% there's I'll find the number

3073
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,900
72% is what they read

3074
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,900
so it's very important

3075
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,900
and as the editor and reporter

3076
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,900
I need to know who wrote the headline

3077
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,900
if it wasn't you who wrote the headline

3078
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:52,900
did you see it?

3079
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,900
and I have several points that I'm going to address with you

3080
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,900
that I think

3081
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,900
that will make this very fair

3082
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:00,900
but the power and balance here

3083
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,900
in terms of who's writing about whom

3084
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,900
we know what that is

3085
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:06,900
and I'll take that into account

3086
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,900
I don't need to show you

3087
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:10,900
this is it

3088
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,900
they know this there's an empowering balance

3089
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,900
you say it to them

3090
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,900
there's an empowering balance in that relationship

3091
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,900
for everyone that's a source

3092
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,900
and a journalist

3093
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:22,900
there is indicative

3094
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,900
and that's what this show is about

3095
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,900
it's about how are you portrayed

3096
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:28,900
versus who you are and the truth is somewhere in between

3097
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,900
and no one gets 100% right

3098
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,900
all the time

3099
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,900
99%

3100
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,900
it's hard to get 100% right

3101
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,900
he's right about that

3102
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,900
but that's not an excuse

3103
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,900
he's using it as an excuse

3104
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,900
that's what I'm saying

3105
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,900
I'm not

3106
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:48,900
I'm not a place to blame

3107
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,900
and blame is not a thing here

3108
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:52,900
I'm not here to

3109
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,900
blame anyone's feet

3110
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:56,900
I know you are

3111
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,900
that's why I'm filming you

3112
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,900
the bankers died

3113
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,900
and they read this and said

3114
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,900
Deutsche Bank pros

3115
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,900
what is the subtext

3116
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,900
is your point that he was

3117
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:10,900
a target of investigation to them

3118
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,900
what is the subtext

3119
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,900
target of investigations

3120
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,900
and he kills himself because

3121
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,900
of the library

3122
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,900
that's what you're saying

3123
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,900
that's what this title says about my father

3124
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,900
it's fair

3125
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,900
it doesn't say he killed himself

3126
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,900
because of the library

3127
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,900
but yes the most people

3128
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,900
50% of people at the very least

3129
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,900
are going to assume

3130
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,900
exactly

3131
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,900
that's the nature of it

3132
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,900
and David just said he just gave it away

3133
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,900
he doesn't know why I'm pissed off

3134
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,900
so he interrupted me to say

3135
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,900
do you mean because I wrote

3136
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:48,900
he was the target of the investigation

3137
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,900
I don't even know that

3138
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,900
but yes that's part of it

3139
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,900
he's guilt is saying

3140
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,900
Valis thinks I'm

3141
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,900
because I wrote him the target of the investigation

3142
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,900
I'm going to talk about this stuff tomorrow

3143
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,900
tomorrow is going to be a long day dude

3144
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,900
is that okay with you

3145
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,900
if Scott doesn't make it

3146
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,900
look honestly it's not the end of the world

3147
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,900
because there's so much to talk about

3148
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:12,900
because that right there

3149
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,900
the context of that

3150
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,900
people aren't going to understand from the book

3151
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,900
nor well I guess he gets into it a little bit in the book

3152
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:20,900
but they're not going to understand the history

3153
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,900
that you guys have had

3154
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:24,900
and the first article

3155
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,900
I'm not going to say it glosses over that history

3156
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,900
he admits that I think he admits

3157
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:30,900
I think it's fair to say

3158
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,900
and I'm not saying this the footage will say this

3159
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,900
and people have their own thing

3160
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,900
Frost Nixon then just got Nixon to admit

3161
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,900
he apologizes

3162
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,900
why is he apologizing

3163
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,900
well I'm not saying that

3164
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,900
I have to get more clarification on why he apologizes

3165
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,900
because him saying this to you

3166
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:48,900
of course he's nervous man

3167
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,900
and I do give him credit for apologizing

3168
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,900
but as you said and we have you on camera

3169
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,900
and so I'm okay saying this

3170
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,900
but he'll apologize

3171
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,900
so were you surprised by his apology

3172
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:00,900
you at least expected it as a possibility

3173
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,900
you said that

3174
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,900
it's really interesting

3175
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,900
it's really interesting

3176
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,900
this is the

3177
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:10,900
anybody else in the room

3178
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,900
reads this line going in naked

3179
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,900
you've made your point pal

3180
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:16,900
I disagree

3181
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:18,900
but I respect where you're coming from

3182
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,900
and I hear you and also I have never thankfully

3183
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,900
been in a situation

3184
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,900
as terrible as what you've been through

3185
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,900
I cannot begin

3186
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,900
to imagine the hurt

3187
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,900
and the trauma

3188
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:32,900
that you have experienced

3189
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,900
I can't

3190
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,900
please

3191
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,900
why did you exploit it then

3192
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:40,900
I certainly did not try to exploit it

3193
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:42,900
how much money have you made off of me

3194
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:44,900
and my father

3195
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:46,900
how much money have you made off of myself

3196
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:48,900
I don't think I've made

3197
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,900
I've received what I would consider in the publishing industry

3198
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:52,900
a relatively meager advance

3199
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,900
and it's

3200
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,900
there's healthcare

3201
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,900
you have

3202
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:00,900
$1.5 million house

3203
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,900
we have

3204
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:04,900
cars

3205
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,900
that's what this is

3206
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,900
you have cars

3207
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,900
I have a toyota

3208
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:12,900
2017 toyota scene at minivan

3209
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,900
a proper job

3210
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,900
so that's the thing about the minivan

3211
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,900
it's important

3212
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,900
I'm very proud to say that why

3213
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:22,900
because at New York Times

3214
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,900
there's a whole thing on him

3215
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,900
having a minivan

3216
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:28,900
there's a story about David Enrich

3217
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,900
New York Times reporter owns a minivan

3218
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,900
I shoot minivans all the time

3219
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,900
I know

3220
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:36,900
but remember the whole course

3221
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:38,900
David wants to be the story

3222
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,900
he knows how to do good

3223
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:42,900
he knows PR a little bit

3224
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,900
that's for sure

3225
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,900
but remember what he was saying

3226
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,900
he was a part of the story

3227
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,900
he wishes he was being reported on

3228
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,900
and here he is in the New York Times

3229
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,900
and Maria and I saw that

3230
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,900
he was like oh my god

3231
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:58,900
he is the Hunter S. Thompson of Banking Reporting

3232
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:00,900
yes

3233
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,900
look

3234
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:04,900
the point is that

3235
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,900
he pushed someone at the New York Times

3236
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,900
to say do a story about me

3237
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,900
and here's how he got himself

3238
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,900
into the story about him

3239
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,900
immersion

3240
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,900
what do you call it

3241
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,900
it goes to show it proves my point

3242
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,900
basically I'm trying to establish a point

3243
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,900
like I said before he's trying to be a part of the story

3244
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,900
and that means he's got to elevate himself

3245
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,900
he's got power and control over the story

3246
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,900
that he's writing that's one thing

3247
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,900
he's got control over me

3248
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:32,900
so he's going to put himself in this position

3249
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:34,900
put me down here

3250
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,900
dismissing me makes me a terrible person

3251
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,900
and asshole discredit me

3252
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,900
and then he got himself into a story

3253
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,900
about him owning a minivan

3254
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:44,900
a knife whatever the fuck it was

3255
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,900
doesn't matter he was in the story finally

3256
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,900
all his life finally I'm in the New York Times

3257
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,900
story about me is what he's thinking

3258
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,900
right I know this fucking guy

3259
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:54,900
so that he comes out and says that

3260
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,900
he thinks it's cute and funny because that's not meant for me

3261
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,900
that's not meant for you

3262
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:00,900
that's meant for his friends at the New York Times

3263
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,900
that comment right there

3264
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,900
Michael Barbaro and the guy that he's with right now

3265
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:06,900
and everyone he knows in the New York Times

3266
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,900
that's what that is for

3267
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,900
that's what that comes for

3268
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,900
and that's trying to get a laugh from his colleagues

3269
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,900
okay well I don't think they're gonna

3270
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:16,900
laugh at this

3271
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,900
but I don't think that is anything to do with you

3272
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,900
or your dad

3273
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,900
well for the last five years because that would seem to be the focus

3274
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:24,900
this book will bring you money

3275
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,900
I know but I hope probably not

3276
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:28,900
but that's what it's meant for

3277
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,900
in his head he's trying to get that

3278
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,900
after that I worked for free

3279
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:34,900
how much have I made

3280
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:36,900
you didn't know what I made

3281
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:38,900
I've never really seen

3282
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:40,900
I've never fucking had

3283
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,900
how do you get per month

3284
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,900
from this project

3285
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,900
my father

3286
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:48,900
my documents

3287
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,900
other than $5,000

3288
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,900
thank you

3289
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,900
that's another thing

3290
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,900
why did you say thank you

3291
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:58,900
you know Glenn Simpson paid me $5,000

3292
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,900
why did you say pay me one

3293
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,900
I believe it says

3294
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:04,900
that he paid me one upfront

3295
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,900
the rest of the $5,000

3296
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,900
he owed you $10,000

3297
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:10,900
he only paid you half of that

3298
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,900
that means he paid you $5,000

3299
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,900
but you said you paid me $1,000

3300
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,900
no I said

3301
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,900
just bring the documents right there

3302
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,900
it's not

3303
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,900
okay here's the one

3304
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,900
the other big thing

3305
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:26,900
this is the other big one

3306
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,900
I don't want to pick everything

3307
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,900
let me just give you the other big one

3308
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:32,900
the other big one was Dan Gold

3309
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,900
you have the recording

3310
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:36,900
I made of Dan Goldman

3311
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,900
and I screamed at each other

3312
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,900
why is this important

3313
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:42,900
okay so in the book

3314
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,900
yeah in the book

3315
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,900
and in the article

3316
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,900
he says that

3317
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,900
Dan Goldman

3318
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:52,900
that I approached Dan Goldman

3319
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,900
first of all

3320
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:56,900
and the reason why I approached him

3321
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:58,900
is because he asked me to

3322
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,900
I approached Dan Goldman

3323
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:02,900
for money

3324
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:04,900
is it give me money or you don't get these documents

3325
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,900
did you say that

3326
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,900
no never once

3327
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,900
no I haven't

3328
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,900
really I see it for money

3329
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,900
yes you did

3330
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,900
but that didn't even mean me

3331
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,900
I don't go around that's the fucking thing

3332
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,900
who wants to do for money

3333
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,900
I'm gonna offer you money

3334
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,900
Glenn yes Glenn said I offer you $10,000

3335
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,900
oh I understand

3336
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,900
I'm gonna give you $10,000

3337
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,900
$10,000

3338
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,900
and it's because

3339
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,900
what's your name

3340
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,900
I'm gonna ask Glenn

3341
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,900
I know a guy that's gonna

3342
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,900
you don't know the fucking story

3343
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,900
that's all I was referring to

3344
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,900
the point is

3345
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:46,900
Dan Goldman said

3346
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:48,900
this is at least coming from David

3347
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,900
and it is true because later

3348
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:52,900
Dan will back us up

3349
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:54,900
David says Val asked Dan Goldman

3350
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,900
for a job

3351
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,900
and then they subpoenaed him

3352
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,900
that's what he said

3353
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,900
and in the book

3354
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,900
and there's a bunch of bullshit

3355
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,900
and then later when article comes out

3356
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,900
and I'm pissed off

3357
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,900
and I'm like what the fuck is this shit

3358
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,900
and I'm like David fuck you asshole

3359
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,900
how could you do this to me

3360
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,900
you fucking piece of shit asshole

3361
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,900
you totally scream me over

3362
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,900
you know what I think I was very fair

3363
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:22,900
and here's an example look I left this out

3364
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,900
because I thought it would be just too much

3365
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:26,900
there was a press release saying

3366
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,900
Val Brooksman was trying to extort us

3367
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,900
and then we subpoenaed him

3368
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:32,900
because we would refuse

3369
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,900
to give him any money

3370
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,900
that's what Dan Goldman said

3371
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:38,900
I was like what the fuck

3372
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,900
so I go scrolling through my text

3373
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,900
and I find the ones with Dan Goldman

3374
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,900
and I see and I bring it up and I send it to them

3375
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,900
the ones with Dan Goldman said

3376
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,900
what really happened I called Dan Goldman

3377
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:50,900
and I'll give you the fucking files

3378
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:52,900
I think I already sent them to you

3379
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,900
okay

3380
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,900
in the Dan Goldman conversation I said

3381
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,900
dude give me, I'll work as an intern

3382
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,900
just fucking let me have some oversight

3383
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:02,900
you don't have to pay me

3384
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:04,900
quote you don't have to pay me

3385
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:06,900
how many times do I have to say

3386
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,900
you don't have to pay me

3387
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:10,900
and David surprised oh Valash says

3388
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:12,900
pay me

3389
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:14,900
I was like what the fuck

3390
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,900
and you don't know the thing now

3391
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,900
the reviews are coming

3392
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,900
every single word about him

3393
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,900
is

3394
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,900
the last one

3395
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,900
which I think is the Washington Post

3396
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,900
and the New York Times says

3397
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,900
he has been extorting money

3398
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:32,900
to buy drugs yes

3399
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:34,900
what the fuck are you showing it

3400
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:36,900
I'll send it to you anyway

3401
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,900
so that's the text

3402
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:40,900
Dan Goldman

3403
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:42,900
and the real story is I was trying to tell him

3404
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,900
I said no I just want some oversight

3405
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:46,900
into my father's stuff

3406
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,900
into how his emails are used

3407
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:50,900
could misuse them

3408
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,900
could use them to profit on

3409
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,900
and take them out of context

3410
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,900
and talk shit about my father

3411
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,900
so that's what I wanted

3412
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:00,900
and I said well fine well fuck you

3413
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,900
and said well we can always subpoena you

3414
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:04,900
I said well good luck with that

3415
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:06,900
and I'm just a guy you're going to subpoena me

3416
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:08,900
and you look like an asshole subpoena me

3417
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:10,900
and also you went to go meet David

3418
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,900
secretly

3419
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:14,900
to inquire about his stories I'm going to bring that up in a minute

3420
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,900
and David went

3421
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:18,900
to the side of the point

3422
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:20,900
but he said four months later nice to meet you

3423
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,900
and then I'm watching shit flail on national television

3424
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,900
and he's fucking up

3425
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,900
he doesn't have anything and I know it

3426
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,900
and so I look it's like a fucking

3427
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:30,900
I feel bad I'm like I should help

3428
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:32,900
so I call up

3429
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,900
I didn't call it I text him and I can give you all the fucking text about it

3430
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,900
I text him

3431
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,900
I text Dan Goldman

3432
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:40,900
so look Dan we go on to a bad start here

3433
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,900
you know

3434
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,900
look I have a couple things I know are going to help you

3435
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,900
send it to you one of them is to breach your boards

3436
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,900
for fucking sake

3437
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,900
you're going to like it let me just give it to you

3438
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,900
but the thing is I'm working with David behind

3439
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,900
so the only way to make this look good

3440
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,900
is if you give me no choice please subpoena me

3441
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,900
you couldn't be fucking clear

3442
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,900
if you subpoena me now

3443
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,900
I'll be able to give it to you right away

3444
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:04,900
and he replies that's a great idea

3445
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:06,900
we'll do that on Monday

3446
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,900
then the following Monday

3447
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:10,900
you can see subpoena as me

3448
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,900
I didn't have the text I said that

3449
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,900
I didn't have the text

3450
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:16,900
I didn't know you

3451
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:18,900
this is a much bigger

3452
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,900
this is important

3453
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:22,900
I need those

3454
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,900
I need those tomorrow

3455
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,900
fuck

3456
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,900
we have a lot to cover tomorrow

3457
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:30,900
I'll have to come back

3458
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,900
but we need some time in between

3459
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,900
we need to process this start editing

3460
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:36,900
and then I'll know what I need to fill in

3461
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,900
because I'm going to have to come back and get another two days with you guys

3462
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:40,900
but it'll be good because

3463
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,900
if we really air it

3464
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,900
we'd give it some time

3465
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,900
whatever you need to do

3466
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,900
you do it

3467
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:50,900
I don't know

3468
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,900
that

3469
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,900
the fallout

3470
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:56,900
if this was wrong

3471
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,900
this is how I'll know in the film

3472
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,900
if David's reporting was wrong

3473
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:02,900
or if the loaned documents exist

3474
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,900
I don't think

3475
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,900
someone will find those documents

3476
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,900
within the next few weeks

3477
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:10,900
or in the next two months

3478
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,900
and that person will be here

3479
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,900
I'm saying it's going to put eyes on it again

3480
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:16,900
so

3481
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,900
the shake up from this isn't over

3482
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,900
I don't think your story is anywhere near over

3483
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,900
I'm really hoping it is

3484
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:24,900
I think it's nearing the final act

3485
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:26,900
I think it's about to get real

3486
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,900
or maybe it just

3487
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:30,900
goes away

3488
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,900
but again

3489
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:34,900
the point is that David has mistakes

3490
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:36,900
I was mad at him

3491
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:38,900
he just got the text

3492
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:40,900
and he even doubled down

3493
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,900
by sending a letter

3494
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:44,900
I already told him

3495
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:46,900
I have to go see

3496
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,900
I say give me money

3497
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,900
I want to go give me your fucking money

3498
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:52,900
I won't give you anything never once that I come up

3499
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:54,900
in fact what I did say

3500
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:56,900
was that Dan I want to work

3501
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,900
in any capacity to have some oversight

3502
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:00,900
into how my fathers emails are used

3503
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,900
because they could be abused by anybody

3504
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:04,900
the context is important

3505
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,900
I will take a job as an intern

3506
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:08,900
you can pay me zero

3507
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,900
I will work for free

3508
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,900
I will fetch coffee

3509
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,900
I just want some say on how it's used

3510
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:16,900
say them to take

3511
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,900
and in your book

3512
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,900
not the book

3513
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:22,900
but your fucking art profile

3514
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:24,900
you say Val has been

3515
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,900
extorting Adam Schiff's people

3516
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:28,900
asking for money

3517
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,900
trying to get anything he can

3518
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,900
extort

3519
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,900
extort

3520
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,900
somebody get him his work

3521
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,900
right at the screen

3522
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:40,900
sorry if I'm

3523
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,900
saying something

3524
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:44,900
but after that when you

3525
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:46,900
printed it out

3526
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,900
she said well actually

3527
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,900
I have this letter from

3528
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:52,900
David

3529
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:54,900
wait

3530
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:56,900
what am I looking for

3531
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:58,900
David said

3532
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:00,900
where are you

3533
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:02,900
search extort

3534
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:04,900
he doesn't say oh sorry

3535
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,900
this is important because David

3536
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,900
I was so mad at David I was texting him

3537
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,900
I was texting him

3538
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:12,900
find the section

3539
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,900
I don't even know what I'm looking for here

3540
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,900
this is probably the wrong story

3541
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,900
tell me a fat story

3542
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,900
listen

3543
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,900
this was important

3544
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:24,900
okay fine

3545
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,900
maybe there's some

3546
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,900
I can't remember

3547
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,900
remember how angry I was

3548
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,900
yeah

3549
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:34,900
I'll never forget how

3550
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:36,900
do you remember what you

3551
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:38,900
copied and pasted

3552
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,900
just let me finish

3553
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:42,900
my sentence you might remember

3554
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:44,900
you copied and pasted a press release

3555
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:46,900
for Madame Schiff's people tango

3556
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,900
about me

3557
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,900
you said

3558
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:52,900
something akin to Val

3559
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,900
look how kind I am to you because I left this out

3560
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,900
yeah that sounds about right

3561
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:58,900
what did they say

3562
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:00,900
it was an on the record statement they provided

3563
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,900
I don't remember it was maybe

3564
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:04,900
they had used the word extort is that possible

3565
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:06,900
I don't remember

3566
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:08,900
but I do have it and you have it in your emails too

3567
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,900
it's a paraphrase because I didn't

3568
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:12,900
my email might take me a while to find it

3569
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,900
I didn't want to spend an hour

3570
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:16,900
I'll give it to you and I'll give it to you as well

3571
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:18,900
they said

3572
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,900
what was the fuck I can't remember now

3573
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:22,900
Val Brooks who came to us trying to get a job

3574
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,900
maybe they didn't use the word extort

3575
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:26,900
to extort us

3576
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,900
and get money from us and we said no

3577
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,900
yeah right so look Val

3578
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,900
look how kind I was to you to leave this out

3579
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:34,900
we subpoenaed him because

3580
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,900
we didn't want to stand for his bullshit

3581
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:38,900
or whatever it was

3582
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:40,900
and so I'm like what the fuck I'm reading this

3583
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,900
and he said look Val I'm so kind I didn't put this in

3584
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,900
and then I said David something you don't know

3585
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:48,900
and I sent you the text

3586
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,900
and you said that you had basically

3587
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:52,900
after the anger phone call

3588
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,900
with him and with you and Goldman

3589
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:56,900
that you would basically

3590
01:58:56,900 --> 01:58:58,900
I believe that you had

3591
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,900
Marlo

3592
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,900
please

3593
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,900
don't kick him

3594
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:06,900
I believe that

3595
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:08,900
you had basically invited him to subpoena you

3596
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,900
that's exactly right

3597
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:12,900
that's what I did

3598
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:14,900
Goldman after we had

3599
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:16,900
you didn't stare with me just to be clear until after the article

3600
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,900
that's right

3601
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:20,900
because I didn't know that before

3602
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:22,900
right but I let you know about it

3603
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:24,900
so what happened was

3604
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,900
Goldman I got a huge fight

3605
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,900
and at the end of the day I said well you fucking subpoena me

3606
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:30,900
then you know that's all

3607
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,900
okay then I will

3608
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:34,900
we don't talk for four months he isn't subpoena me

3609
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,900
I look around and I see Adam Schiff

3610
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:38,900
wavering on television he's not going anywhere

3611
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:40,900
and I'm thinking you know what

3612
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,900
maybe I can't help I'm feeling bad now

3613
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:44,900
like no I have this one

3614
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:46,900
document I know will help and this other one

3615
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:48,900
maybe it will help

3616
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,900
so I said I send him a text which I

3617
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:52,900
you have copies of

3618
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,900
I said look I'm really sorry

3619
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,900
maybe we can work something else out

3620
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:58,900
the thing is I'm dealing with the FBI

3621
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:00,900
I'm helping them and I think it would be better

3622
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,900
if you subpoenaed me

3623
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:04,900
because that way I can tell the FBI I had no choice

3624
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:06,900
and there are these two documents you're going to need

3625
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:08,900
one is the breach report

3626
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:10,900
and another one was this other thing

3627
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:12,900
I can't really quite remember right now

3628
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:14,900
but again it's in your text

3629
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:16,900
and that says Val

3630
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:18,900
yeah it sounds like a great idea let's do that

3631
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:20,900
okay and then I was subpoena

3632
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:22,900
the next following Monday

3633
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:24,900
immediately and then I said thank you

3634
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,900
and I gave him everything I could

3635
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,900
and I said the FBI guys

3636
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,900
they subpoenaed me so I'm sorry

3637
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:32,900
there's nothing I can do about it

3638
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,900
and so I gave it to him and that's how it worked

3639
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:36,900
and then I showed you that story I told you

3640
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:38,900
and you did nothing

3641
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:40,900
you didn't take anything back you didn't write anything

3642
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,900
you did nothing

3643
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:44,900
I'm sorry

3644
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,900
he did subpoena you

3645
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,900
the way you frame it

3646
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:50,900
in the story is not

3647
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:52,900
can I start understanding you correctly

3648
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,900
you're upset with me

3649
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,900
because I didn't include

3650
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:58,900
something that you deliberately

3651
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:00,900
you didn't do your homework

3652
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:02,900
you didn't do your fucking homework

3653
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:04,900
you didn't do your research

3654
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:06,900
you didn't talk to them you didn't get the truth

3655
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:08,900
if you had told them dad he's not going to lie to you

3656
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,900
you know dad

3657
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:12,900
he's a douchebag dick

3658
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:14,900
but he's the truth he's an honest guy

3659
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,900
and he's respectable

3660
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:18,900
he's respected for his honesty

3661
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,900
and his prashness

3662
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:22,900
and he would tell you the truth and you had to ask him

3663
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,900
but you didn't

3664
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,900
or maybe he did but left it out

3665
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:28,900
just to be 100% clear

3666
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,900
and I know this

3667
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:32,900
I know this but just so the camera knows it too

3668
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:34,900
you could have provided that to me

3669
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,900
in real time

3670
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,900
as I was writing the article

3671
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,900
before the article ran

3672
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:42,900
and you chose for whatever reason not to

3673
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:44,900
you agree with that

3674
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:46,900
I mean that's a

3675
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:48,900
that's a good way

3676
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:50,900
that's a good way about David's friends

3677
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:52,900
things

3678
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,900
that's a good example

3679
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:56,900
I'm glad we got that on camera

3680
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:58,900
that's a good example how you do this

3681
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:00,900
here it's a little nasty to say that

3682
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:02,900
because oh you knew I was writing

3683
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:04,900
after people blah blah blah

3684
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:06,900
well this article has been

3685
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,900
edited for so long so

3686
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:10,900
suddenly

3687
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:12,900
you ever check if he did it for your narrative

3688
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:14,900
or maybe he did but left it out

3689
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:16,900
wait I don't know

3690
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:18,900
just to be 100% clear

3691
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,900
and I know this

after people blah blah blah

3707
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:52,900
well this article has been

3708
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:54,900
awaited for so long so

3709
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:56,900
suddenly

3710
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:58,900
a year and a half

3711
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:00,900
you let me on for a year and a half

3712
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:02,900
and what I wanted to say every three months

3713
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:04,900
it's going to happen next month

3714
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:06,900
next month it's going to change your life

3715
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,900
but the point was

3716
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:10,900
that as a response to your anger

3717
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:12,900
was like look I got a letter

3718
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:14,900
from these people and I believe them

3719
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:16,900
right

3720
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,900
and not you after five years

3721
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:20,900
right after I never lied to you

3722
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:22,900
and you heard the text

3723
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,900
I mean the voice mail

3724
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,900
yeah I thought you didn't have the truth

3725
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,900
right there

3726
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:30,900
you told a different story

3727
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,900
can I say the word lie is that extreme

3728
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:34,900
can I say the word lie

3729
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,900
is that applicable here

3730
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:38,900
can I say David's lie

3731
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:40,900
I think that it just shows a trait

3732
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:42,900
of character and choices

3733
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:44,900
and it's just very concerning

3734
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:46,900
irresponsible

3735
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,900
yeah it's concerning

3736
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:50,900
yeah well you guys

3737
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,900
listen and there's more David

3738
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:54,900
no no excuse me

3739
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,900
please calm down David

3740
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:58,900
listen David

3741
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:00,900
remember when you met with them

3742
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,900
in New York remember

3743
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:04,900
sorry they came out to meet you in New York

3744
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:06,900
goldman and global

3745
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:08,900
remember this meeting

3746
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,900
all I'm going to say about

3747
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:12,900
I'm going to say one thing about them

3748
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:14,900
I'll just say up front

3749
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:16,900
the one thing I'm going to say about that meeting

3750
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:18,900
other than that it did happen

3751
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:20,900
is that they asked

3752
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:22,900
from my opinion on you

3753
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:24,900
and they gave me specific authorization

3754
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:26,900
they put that part on the record

3755
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,900
your credibility and if you had good stuff

3756
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:30,900
so that's do you remember how pissed off you got

3757
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,900
after reading that

3758
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,900
that phone call because I said what did I say

3759
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,900
I said what the fuck are two

3760
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:38,900
lawyers from Washington coming up

3761
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:40,900
and inquiring about a source

3762
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:42,900
a New York Times writer giving up his source

3763
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,900
why are they coming up there and why are you talking about me to them

3764
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:46,900
I was livid about it

3765
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:48,900
and then you reacted like I was the asshole

3766
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:50,900
for bringing it up because that looks

3767
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:52,900
really bad lawyers coming up

3768
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:54,900
from DC to New York to talk

3769
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,900
to a writer to inquire about his source

3770
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:58,900
that's not really

3771
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:00,900
the way I would characterize

3772
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:02,900
okay well you clearly thought I was fucked up

3773
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:04,900
that's quite clear

3774
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:06,900
is anyone else think that's fucked up

3775
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:08,900
is this normal behavior there's it

3776
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:10,900
because I'm accusing him of giving up his source

3777
02:05:10,900 --> 02:05:12,900
lawyers in Washington

3778
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:14,900
me the two lawyers

3779
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:16,900
Dan Noble and Dan Goldman come up from Washington DC

3780
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:18,900
and they ask about me

3781
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:20,900
they inquire about your source

3782
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:22,900
and he told them all about me

3783
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:24,900
and he said to them

3784
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:26,900
that Vau was difficult

3785
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:28,900
so it was difficult

3786
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:30,900
all that shit and he asked Dan Goldman

3787
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:32,900
what he said and then

3788
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,900
he said it was difficult

3789
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:36,900
you think Dan Goldman will tell me the truth really

3790
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:38,900
I think he will

3791
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:40,900
well he's gonna spin it he writes down the truth

3792
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:42,900
we have it though

3793
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:44,900
we have it though

3794
02:05:44,900 --> 02:05:46,900
okay I'll send you the recording

3795
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:48,900
that's another big favor

3796
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,900
but this is a big one because you can get fired for that

3797
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:52,900
why is that sitting downstairs

3798
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:54,900
or is the editor in chief advice

3799
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:56,900
hey editor in chief advice is that fucked up

3800
02:05:56,900 --> 02:05:58,900
you asshole bringing me in

3801
02:05:58,900 --> 02:06:00,900
he's not gonna say anything

3802
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,900
but he's giving me the truth

3803
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:04,900
but he needs to fuck up

3804
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:06,900
David you burned me slanted me

3805
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:08,900
you fucked me over

3806
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,900
you left me out to dry

3807
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:12,900
you did whatever you could to get ahead in your world

3808
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:14,900
you used the fuck out of me

3809
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:16,900
you used my father's emails

3810
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:18,900
you used me

3811
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:20,900
you could and you ran with it

3812
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:22,900
and there were consequences to those actions

3813
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:24,900
Tammy may not be fighting back like I am

3814
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:26,900
Lauren whatever her name is

3815
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:28,900
probably not and poor Tom Hayes

3816
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:30,900
he's in fucking jail dude

3817
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:32,900
14 years of jail

3818
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:34,900
he's not gonna fight back and he's autistic too

3819
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:36,900
and that was kind of an easy target wasn't it

3820
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:38,900
you know about just

3821
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:40,900
I am a grieving

3822
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:42,900
son my father killed himself

3823
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,900
I got a screw loose I'm sure

3824
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:46,900
I've got my own problems

3825
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:48,900
yes I enjoyed oxycodone

3826
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,900
okay yes I enjoy drugs

3827
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:52,900
and I like to party I like to have fun

3828
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:54,900
and sometimes I think I'm funny enough

3829
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:56,900
whatever but you took advantage of me too

3830
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:58,900
you did

3831
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:00,900
sorry for that one

3832
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:02,900
I'm sure you're so sorry

3833
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:04,900
I feel that way

3834
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:06,900
I love that non-apology apology

3835
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:08,900
I've already given a full-throated apology

3836
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:10,900
for what I am actually saying

3837
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:12,900
fuck your apology

3838
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:14,900
and listen here are consequences to your actions

3839
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:16,900
apologies words don't mean shit

3840
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,900
actions mean things

3841
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:20,900
my father how many times have I told you

3842
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:22,900
what my father told me

3843
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,900
how many times it doesn't matter

3844
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:26,900
what people say you want to know

3845
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:28,900
you stand with someone you look at what they do

3846
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:30,900
don't even fucking listen to their words

3847
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,900
do you remember that how many times I told you

3848
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:34,900
you told me that a lot of times

3849
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:36,900
so right that's what I'm going by right now

3850
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:38,900
and look what you've done

3851
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:40,900
which is what you said

3852
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:42,900
and the problem is your words

3853
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:44,900
they have a platform

3854
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:46,900
okay they have a huge

3855
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,900
powerful platform

3856
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:50,900
a terribly fucking sword

3857
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:52,900
that you yield

3858
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,900
and you care less of it

3859
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:56,900
and not just with me

3860
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:58,900
but with other people care less of it

3861
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:00,900
and you don't give a fuck about that

3862
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:02,900
you only care about your next project

3863
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:04,900
and what you're going to get

3864
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:06,900
and what you can take from me

3865
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:08,900
and what you took from me

3866
02:08:08,900 --> 02:08:10,900
I don't think I'm going to get that

3867
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:12,900
no

3868
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:14,900
so what do I do

3869
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:16,900
do I do the forward

3870
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:18,900
in my life

3871
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:20,900
and forget all about it

3872
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:22,900
you know my style

3873
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:24,900
you know me a little bit

3874
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:26,900
you know me a little bit

3875
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,900
you know my style

3876
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:30,900
I would say that isn't your style

3877
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:32,900
you'd be correct

3878
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,900
now I feel like let's take a break

3879
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:38,900
I'm ready

3880
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:40,900
I'm ready

3881
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:52,900
what else do you have to say

3882
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:54,900
what do you think

3883
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:56,900
what do I think

3884
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,900
why did you come

3885
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:00,900
what do you think

3886
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,900
what you're going to get out

3887
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:04,900
and what you can take from me

3888
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:06,900
and what you took from me

3889
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:08,900
I don't think I'm going to get that

3890
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:10,900
so what do I do

3891
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:12,900
do I do the forward

3892
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:14,900
in my life

3893
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:16,900
what are you planning on doing

3894
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:18,900
what do you mean

3895
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:20,900
be transparent

3896
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:22,900
what are you going to do

3897
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:24,900
I need to organize this in my head

3898
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,900
you don't know me yet

3899
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,900
that's what I'm asking

3900
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:30,900
you think I'm using this

3901
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:32,900
in some sort of thing

3902
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:34,900
I'm asking you

3903
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:36,900
I'm telling you

3904
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:38,900
we just need it for it

3905
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,900
so I know what the fuck I said

3906
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,900
so if I'm attacked

3907
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:44,900
I can remember what the fuck I said

3908
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:46,900
and I can remember what the fuck he said

3909
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:48,900
sometimes in my head I mix things up

3910
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,900
well there's a lot of shit

3911
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:52,900
I don't know if David said

3912
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:54,900
like the word for example

3913
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:56,900
I fucked up with the word extort

3914
02:09:56,900 --> 02:09:58,900
like I was sure it was in his article

3915
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:00,900
but it turns out the word extort was in

3916
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:02,900
Dan Goldman's press release

3917
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:04,900
fuck that one up

3918
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:06,900
the word that he used

3919
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:08,900
demanding money

3920
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:10,900
demanding money

3921
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:12,900
something similar to that

3922
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:14,900
but anyway I just want to know this for my

3923
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:16,900
my own stuff

3924
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:18,900
and we like to

3925
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:20,900
I like to listen to the recordings to figure out what the fuck

3926
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:22,900
cause I get caught up in the moment

3927
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,900
I don't remember it all

3928
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,900
I don't understand some of the stuff

3929
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:28,900
in the context

3930
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,900
talking about it without a reference here

3931
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:32,900
it would have been kind of impossible

3932
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,900
I know yeah so I'm trying to give you that too

3933
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:36,900
at the same time

3934
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,900
and I'm going to send you the article

3935
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:40,900
yeah we're sending all this stuff

3936
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:42,900
and we're going to send him the recording to Dan Goldman

3937
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:44,900
cause I have a decision to make

3938
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:46,900
I think I definitely will go talk to David

3939
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:48,900
if he'll let me at the time's office

3940
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:50,900
because there's certainly

3941
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:52,900
a lot of stuff that like

3942
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:54,900
I don't have a checklist

3943
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:56,900
of stuff that we will go through

3944
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:58,900
that needs to be fact checked

3945
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:00,900
and like you said

3946
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:02,900
people get everything

3947
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:04,900
with the questions

3948
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:06,900
well

3949
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:08,900
there's gotta be like 10

3950
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:10,900
that's pretty easy

3951
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:12,900
is that my style

3952
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:14,900
you know me a little bit

3953
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:16,900
I do know you a little bit

3954
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:18,900
is that my style

3955
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:20,900
I would say that

3956
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:22,900
you'd be correct

3957
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:24,900
good well let now

3958
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:26,900
I feel like let's take a break

3959
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:28,900
do you want some water

3960
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:30,900
I'm fine I'm ready

3961
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:32,900
but if you want to take a break

3962
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:34,900
can I get some water

3963
02:11:34,900 --> 02:11:36,900
you want to yell David

3964
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:38,900
you can yell David

3965
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:40,900
I'll give you some

3966
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:42,900
what else do you have to say

3967
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,900
what do you think Dan

3968
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:46,900
it doesn't matter

3969
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:48,900
what do I think

3970
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,900
why did you come in

3971
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,900
what do you think

3972
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:54,900
I'm good thank you

3973
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:56,900
you guys

3974
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:58,900
do you want some water

3975
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:00,900
do you want some water

3976
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:02,900
I know how

3977
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:04,900
thank you

3978
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:06,900
let's really talk

3979
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,900
I don't have information

3980
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:10,900
from this guy

3981
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:12,900
well you can

3982
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:14,900
I think we can cut around with you

3983
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:16,900
I'm gonna ask

3984
02:12:16,900 --> 02:12:18,900
so you have more to say

3985
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:20,900
the reason we came out here

3986
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:22,900
you were gonna want

3987
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:24,900
to rip into me a little bit

3988
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:26,900
and obviously

3989
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:28,900
that is your prerogative

3990
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:30,900
so you have a massacist

3991
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,900
no Val

3992
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:34,900
because honestly

3993
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:36,900
now it's not a massacist

3994
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:38,900
it's a sense that

3995
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:40,900
you have a great story

3996
02:12:40,900 --> 02:12:42,900
and I want to share your story

3997
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:44,900
with as many people as possible

3998
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:46,900
and there's no better way to do that

3999
02:12:46,900 --> 02:12:48,900
than hearing it straight out of your mouth

4000
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:50,900
and

4001
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:52,900
this is your opportunity to do that

4002
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:54,900
so if you want to move

4003
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:56,900
my opportunity

4004
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:58,900
do you have the way you frame it

4005
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:00,900
to my opportunity to do that with you

4006
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:02,900
you're giving me such a big value

4007
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:04,900
to me in this opportunity

4008
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:06,900
it's not me

4009
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:08,900
do you see how I could pick that up

4010
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:10,900
as offensive

4011
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:12,900
not really honestly but yes

4012
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:14,900
I understand

4013
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:16,900
I'm not trying to be offensive about

4014
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:18,900
I'm just honestly trying to

4015
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:20,900
if you would like

4016
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:22,900
to tell your story

4017
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:24,900
the place I would like to start

4018
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:26,900
is offering you

4019
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,900
I would just like to hear you

4020
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:30,900
talk about your dad a little bit

4021
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:32,900
and tell us who was Bill Brooksman

4022
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:34,900
we'll get there baby

4023
02:13:34,900 --> 02:13:36,900
we'll get there

4024
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:38,900
now right now I'm a little upset with you

4025
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:40,900
and I need to air this

4026
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:42,900
grievance with you

4027
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:44,900
it's very important for me

4028
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:46,900
I can tell

4029
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:48,900
why you wanted me to talk about your father

4030
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:50,900
I'm very curious about your intentions

4031
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:52,900
I'm thinking why is he coming

4032
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:54,900
do you mind if I just cut that

4033
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,900
this was a story

4034
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:58,900
that David didn't

4035
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:00,900
pitch it to us or anything

4036
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,900
I found

4037
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:04,900
I was really intrigued by

4038
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:06,900
the more I read about your story

4039
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:08,900
we tell stories about the news

4040
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:10,900
yours is a perfect example

4041
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:12,900
of that you have an incredible

4042
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:14,900
story that we're able to tell

4043
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:16,900
and people understand

4044
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:18,900
what's happening in the news

4045
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:20,900
and so that's

4046
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:22,900
my goal here

4047
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:24,900
is to get the story from your mouth

4048
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:26,900
the more that we get from you

4049
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,900
of your own story the less that we have to rely on David

4050
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:30,900
to tell it

4051
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:32,900
I like the sound of that

4052
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:34,900
Marlo please

4053
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,900
Marie please

4054
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:38,900
that's a great

4055
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:40,900
I can't even hear

4056
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:42,900
sorry Eric

4057
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:44,900
just to give you an idea

4058
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:46,900
we're interested in starting from your childhood

4059
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:48,900
learning more about your relationship with your dad

4060
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:50,900
and hearing about

4061
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:52,900
your quest to

4062
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:54,900
get some understanding about this thing

4063
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:56,900
to have it in your life

4064
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:58,900
David's here

4065
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:02,900
David as the

4066
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:04,900
reporter who's done most of the reporting

4067
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:06,900
until this point

4068
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,900
so with

4069
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:10,900
you writing the profile

4070
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:12,900
so what did you think of

4071
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:14,900
you didn't even know about me

4072
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,900
yeah I mean I was intrigued by

4073
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:18,900
your story

4074
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,900
I just thought it was compelling

4075
02:15:20,900 --> 02:15:22,900
knowing how writers write

4076
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:24,900
and how this industry works

4077
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:26,900
in the New York Times as you read the story

4078
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:28,900
you're like oh this is a bit on the negative side

4079
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:30,900
right

4080
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:32,900
I had the same thing

4081
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:34,900
I don't know if I feel comfortable

4082
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:36,900
making that judgment

4083
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:38,900
let's pretend this is the answer

4084
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:40,900
okay so let's say I felt this is a little negative

4085
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:42,900
maybe it's a bit more one sided

4086
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,900
than I thought

4087
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:46,900
maybe it would be good to hear the other story

4088
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:48,900
yeah I mean our whole goal

4089
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:50,900
is for your voice to be

4090
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:52,900
if that's the truth to me yes I would be happy

4091
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:54,900
yeah yeah I mean it absolutely is

4092
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:56,900
I can tell you that 100%

4093
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:58,900
okay so with David

4094
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:00,900
you know I don't

4095
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,900
I'm just a bit upset

4096
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:04,900
yeah I'm totally upset

4097
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:06,900
and I feel used

4098
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:08,900
and it felt like I was

4099
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:10,900
I feel like I was fucking betrayed

4100
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:12,900
when he was there

4101
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,900
you know I called you a friend

4102
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,900
and I will never do that again

4103
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:18,900
so

4104
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,900
no I don't need you

4105
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:22,900
to be my friend

4106
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:24,900
well we're not friends you're

4107
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:26,900
you're not a journalist

4108
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:28,900
I can't count the number of times I've said that to you

4109
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:30,900
okay and I can't count the number of times you said

4110
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:32,900
oh I'm gonna see you a friend

4111
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:34,900
this is what friends do

4112
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:36,900
fuck's sake David

4113
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:38,900
oh my god I know so many other people

4114
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,900
it's just your

4115
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,900
I mean I know you're on the spot

4116
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:44,900
and it's tough

4117
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:46,900
and you're being attacked

4118
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:48,900
and your defenses are up

4119
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:50,900
I get that and I'm taking advantage of that too

4120
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:52,900
I'm sure you know this

4121
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:54,900
this is a part of my revenge

4122
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:56,900
okay this is a small part of my revenge

4123
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:58,900
but

4124
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:00,900
I am upset and it's very hard for me

4125
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:02,900
to talk about something dear to me

4126
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:04,900
this is my father

4127
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:06,900
what I feel like this person

4128
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:08,900
is going to

4129
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:10,900
sabotage take it from me

4130
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:12,900
rip it and abuse it and pervert it in some way

4131
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:14,900
you know I know that now

4132
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:16,900
since it's on the record there's no way he's going to be able to get away with it

4133
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:18,900
but I still don't feel

4134
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:22,900
safety

4135
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:24,900
I felt before

4136
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:26,900
you know

4137
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:28,900
generally I love talking about my father

4138
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:30,900
you know

4139
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:32,900
but now right now

4140
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:34,900
I think maybe we should

4141
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:36,900
maybe save it for tomorrow

4142
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:38,900
I mean if that's two or three hours later

4143
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:40,900
I can't

4144
02:17:40,900 --> 02:17:42,900
we just need to save some time

4145
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:44,900
of course

4146
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:46,900
we have two days that's why we wanted to take advantage of that

4147
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:48,900
so

4148
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:50,900
I mean if you feel like we can be better

4149
02:17:50,900 --> 02:17:52,900
like the air is more clear for tomorrow

4150
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:54,900
yeah just some time prior when we breathe

4151
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:56,900
that more goes to the corners

4152
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:58,900
have the coaches

4153
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:00,900
have the water in their faces

4154
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:02,900
and so we come out without guns

4155
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:04,900
yeah

4156
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:06,900
I mean so do you feel like

4157
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,900
you've said what you needed to say

4158
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:10,900
today

4159
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:12,900
Ray what do you think

4160
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:14,900
do you remember

4161
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:16,900
is there anything else you wanted to say

4162
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:18,900
I have this much on

4163
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:20,900
but I don't know

4164
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,900
no no

4165
02:18:22,900 --> 02:18:24,900
because you're just affected

4166
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:26,900
just as much as I was

4167
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,900
remember it wasn't just me that got

4168
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:30,900
screwed over here in fact

4169
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:32,900
it was a lot of people

4170
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:34,900
so Marie do you have anything to say please

4171
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:36,900
no I just

4172
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:38,900
I mean to me it's just

4173
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:40,900
as I said

4174
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:42,900
I've known both of them

4175
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:44,900
the same teacher

4176
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:46,900
I just want to say

4177
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:48,900
I need to talk to his father

4178
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:50,900
actually

4179
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:52,900
use this

4180
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:54,900
against me

4181
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:56,900
very

4182
02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:58,900
very

4183
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:00,900
intensely

4184
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:02,900
on his favor of course

4185
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:04,900
and

4186
02:19:04,900 --> 02:19:06,900
I will not

4187
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:08,900
hear the end of it

4188
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:10,900
every time I have him on the phone

4189
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:12,900
or I see him

4190
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:14,900
or you see him

4191
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:16,900
it's another set of

4192
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:18,900
humiliation

4193
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:20,900
I've had people come up to me

4194
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:22,900
saying

4195
02:19:22,900 --> 02:19:24,900
our children are friends

4196
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:26,900
but I think it's best

4197
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:28,900
we start being friends

4198
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:30,900
so I had a lot of friends

4199
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:32,900
in LA

4200
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:34,900
I don't have them anymore

4201
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:38,900
I mean

4202
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,900
this guy is a bad guy

4203
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:42,900
I mean this is another person I know

4204
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,900
and I was saying that

4205
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:46,900
I mean I think

4206
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:48,900
even Allah would not believe it

4207
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:50,900
like she would not believe it

4208
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:52,900
Allah is the only

4209
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:54,900
Oh sorry

4210
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:56,900
and that's

4211
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:00,900
to me it's like

4212
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:02,900
I'm kind of a pessimist

4213
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:04,900
and he's an eternal

4214
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:06,900
optimist

4215
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:08,900
and it's very

4216
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:10,900
charming but

4217
02:20:10,900 --> 02:20:12,900
I was always careful

4218
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:14,900
and just you know I don't say everything

4219
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:16,900
way to day

4220
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:18,900
and these and that

4221
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:20,900
I would always tell her

4222
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:22,900
I trust David please

4223
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:24,900
trust me that I trust him

4224
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:26,900
you know me

4225
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:28,900
he's okay

4226
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:30,900
I said over and over to her

4227
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:32,900
and everybody met

4228
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:34,900
you were like the greatest

4229
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:36,900
I was crying

4230
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:38,900
and if somebody had something bad

4231
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:40,900
several times

4232
02:20:40,900 --> 02:20:42,900
but David

4233
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:44,900
anything that had to do with you

4234
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:46,900
and like

4235
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:48,900
like his life

4236
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:50,900
and

4237
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:52,900
to him

4238
02:20:52,900 --> 02:20:54,900
you guys were working together

4239
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:56,900
I know it's your book and he's not a writer

4240
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:58,900
we talk every day for like two and a half years

4241
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:00,900
you gave him

4242
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:02,900
so many answers

4243
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:04,900
so many information

4244
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:06,900
and in the book it's like

4245
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:08,900
lovely little acknowledgement

4246
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:10,900
I mean come on

4247
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:12,900
wait sorry I didn't press the last one

4248
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:14,900
you acknowledge him

4249
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:16,900
but oh yes

4250
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:18,900
it does relationship

4251
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:20,900
very nice

4252
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:22,900
I do think it's great

4253
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:24,900
he changed the

4254
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:26,900
I read it

4255
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:28,900
I read it

4256
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:30,900
wait hang on

4257
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:32,900
you haven't seen a draft of us

4258
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:34,900
oh I've seen

4259
02:21:34,900 --> 02:21:36,900
how's that

4260
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:38,900
I don't know

4261
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:40,900
I mean I just

4262
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:42,900
I

4263
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:44,900
there's

4264
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:46,900
did you really think I wasn't going to

4265
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:48,900
get a copy of the book

4266
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:50,900
you know

4267
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,900
did you really think I would let this slide

4268
02:21:54,900 --> 02:21:56,900
I think the book reflects really well on you though

4269
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:58,900
and it

4270
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:00,900
I think

4271
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:02,900
I don't know if you've read it

4272
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:04,900
I've told you I've read it

4273
02:22:04,900 --> 02:22:06,900
around to him

4274
02:22:06,900 --> 02:22:08,900
I read it myself

4275
02:22:08,900 --> 02:22:10,900
then I read it around because

4276
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:12,900
it was too painful for him to read it

4277
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:14,900
so

4278
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:16,900
yeah I can imagine these are like

4279
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:18,900
really painful events for you

4280
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:20,900
it wasn't that it was you

4281
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:22,900
you can still see it in the book

4282
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:24,900
like what

4283
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:26,900
like what in the book

4284
02:22:26,900 --> 02:22:28,900
I know I'm a

4285
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:30,900
meandering sort of

4286
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:32,900
idiotic

4287
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:34,900
asshole that you're hopeless

4288
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:36,900
these were hopeless

4289
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:38,900
and I had to go down all the time

4290
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:40,900
careless with people

4291
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:42,900
and really I was mean to my mother

4292
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:44,900
yeah for

4293
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:46,900
for Allah

4294
02:22:46,900 --> 02:22:48,900
yes it's terrible

4295
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:50,900
you couldn't stop yourself

4296
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:52,900
then sending me money to him

4297
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:54,900
he doesn't do anything

4298
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:56,900
he couldn't handle the money anyway

4299
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:00,900
I'm not sure how

4300
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,900
my guess is you got a hold of a book

4301
02:23:02,900 --> 02:23:04,900
a version of the book that was sent to

4302
02:23:04,900 --> 02:23:06,900
and Roxanne

4303
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:08,900
probably

4304
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,900
no no

4305
02:23:10,900 --> 02:23:12,900
yes you do

4306
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:18,900
so that's what it doesn't make sense

4307
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:20,900
that's the secret

4308
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:22,900
but you get what I'm saying

4309
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:24,900
it doesn't make sense

4310
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:26,900
with how he's claiming

4311
02:23:26,900 --> 02:23:28,900
you never said that to Odessa

4312
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:30,900
Odessa's saying she didn't say that

4313
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:32,900
but she leaked your book

4314
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:34,900
oh yeah

4315
02:23:34,900 --> 02:23:36,900
she has no clue

4316
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:38,900
well then you know what

4317
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:40,900
there you go

4318
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:42,900
I'm just saying

4319
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:44,900
the fact that she had the book

4320
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:46,900
I didn't tell you

4321
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:48,900
I understand

4322
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:50,900
I understand

4323
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:52,900
actually his moral

4324
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:54,900
made him hesitate until

4325
02:23:54,900 --> 02:23:56,900
the very very last minute

4326
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:58,900
because he was

4327
02:23:58,900 --> 02:24:00,900
I mean even last night I had an argument with you

4328
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:02,900
is he still defending you

4329
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:04,900
yeah I can't believe I caught myself defending

4330
02:24:04,900 --> 02:24:06,900
I said you were right

4331
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:08,900
you were right

4332
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:10,900
it was like instinct to just defend it

4333
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:12,900
I said no David it wasn't

4334
02:24:12,900 --> 02:24:14,900
well from whatever it was the guys

4335
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:16,900
the people who don't have a stake in this one were the other

4336
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:18,900
and I very much do have a stake in it

4337
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:20,900
obviously you guys do too

4338
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:22,900
who don't know you

4339
02:24:22,900 --> 02:24:24,900
who don't really know me

4340
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:26,900
and have read it think that

4341
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:28,900
they have a very different read on

4342
02:24:28,900 --> 02:24:30,900
every time I see a review

4343
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:32,900
I don't see my name

4344
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:34,900
I don't see my father's name

4345
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:36,900
I see a blurb that says

4346
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:38,900
David's exposing Deutsche Bank

4347
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:40,900
stay tuned for more Deutsche Bank

4348
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:42,900
and more terrible things

4349
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:44,900
and I'm supposed to be the main character right

4350
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:46,900
you're a main character

4351
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:48,900
you're a dad or probably the main character

4352
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:50,900
that was a mention of us

4353
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:52,900
and why am I not on the back of the book

4354
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:54,900
where's the description

4355
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:56,900
if I am such a main character

4356
02:24:56,900 --> 02:24:58,900
tell me about it

4357
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:00,900
the banker's son

4358
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:02,900
was not the original title

4359
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:04,900
that was the title I started with

4360
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:06,900
but that was what I got

4361
02:25:06,900 --> 02:25:08,900
regret telling you that about me

4362
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:10,900
because I told you at the time

4363
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:12,900
that that was definitely something

4364
02:25:12,900 --> 02:25:14,900
that we were toying with that might not happen

4365
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:16,900
but I'm just looking at actually the back of the book

4366
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:18,900
where it's described as

4367
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:20,900
father-son drama

4368
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:22,900
it's

4369
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:24,900
it's very much

4370
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:26,900
about you and about your father

4371
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:28,900
I don't think anyone

4372
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:30,900
is my name in there

4373
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:32,900
we're on the back of the book

4374
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:34,900
we're just there with the index

4375
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:36,900
we're just a main character

4376
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:38,900
but usually they would be in the description

4377
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:40,900
so this is what the book's about

4378
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:42,900
we had an agreement

4379
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:44,900
did we not that the book was going to be about my father

4380
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:46,900
and my journey mostly

4381
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:48,900
over the course of the last five years

4382
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:50,900
of what I've discovered

4383
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:52,900
through my eyes

4384
02:25:52,900 --> 02:25:54,900
that's definitely the bulk of the book

4385
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:56,900
that's also what you pitched in New York Times

4386
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:58,900
because you sent me the

4387
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:00,900
what the pitch that you sent in New York Times

4388
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:02,900
and you sent me the pitch that you sent to our colleagues

4389
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:04,900
and both of them said

4390
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:06,900
okay that the book was about me

4391
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:08,900
and my father and the journey that I've been through

4392
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:10,900
and I told you back through my eyes

4393
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:12,900
okay that is not what I read

4394
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:14,900
well that is a very different book

4395
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:16,900
I'm not sure what you read Val

4396
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:18,900
but the I

4397
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:20,900
look let's just let the book speak for itself then

4398
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:22,900
because I don't think

4399
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:24,900
any person

4400
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:26,900
who reads that book will possibly

4401
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:28,900
come away with agreements

4402
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:30,900
except for the fact that you are not

4403
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:32,900
by name

4404
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:34,900
you ignore your dad I believe

4405
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:36,900
it's prominently mentioned by name

4406
02:26:36,900 --> 02:26:38,900
on the jacket of the book

4407
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:40,900
right and if

4408
02:26:40,900 --> 02:26:42,900
the tables return we should be a bit upset

4409
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:44,900
honestly if I was just in this

4410
02:26:44,900 --> 02:26:46,900
to have my dad's legacy

4411
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:48,900
every time you say I'm on the side

4412
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:50,900
of the word honestly

4413
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:54,900
if I was just concerned about

4414
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:56,900
my dad's legacy and I read this book

4415
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:58,900
I think I would be pretty

4416
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:00,900
pretty content with it

4417
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:02,900
and what did I say earlier on

4418
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:04,900
I said you did a good job with my father

4419
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:06,900
and respected him

4420
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:08,900
and I was appreciated

4421
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:10,900
so let's not lose sight of him

4422
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:12,900
no I didn't lose sight of him

4423
02:27:12,900 --> 02:27:14,900
but me it's another story

4424
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:16,900
I do have to defend myself too

4425
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:18,900
and I talk all over

4426
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:20,900
and I refuse to

4427
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:22,900
and I'm not going to let it happen

4428
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:24,900
and this whole thing right here

4429
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:26,900
who is this benefit

4430
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:28,900
who is this benefit

4431
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:30,900
wait one way please

4432
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:32,900
who is this benefit

4433
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,900
what's this

4434
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:36,900
the day the podcast

4435
02:27:36,900 --> 02:27:38,900
who does it benefit

4436
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:40,900
does it benefit me or you

4437
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:42,900
you have a book to sell

4438
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:44,900
it doesn't matter

4439
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:46,900
it's not the same days your book

4440
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:48,900
it's coming out but this benefit too

4441
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:50,900
what does what mean

4442
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:52,900
why do they do this then

4443
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:54,900
they can't say that they're promoting the book

4444
02:27:54,900 --> 02:27:56,900
they can't say

4445
02:27:56,900 --> 02:27:58,900
it benefits one of the writers

4446
02:27:58,900 --> 02:28:00,900
but he said this is not coming out

4447
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:02,900
around the release of the book

4448
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:04,900
he's lying

4449
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:06,900
it's an obvious lie

4450
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:08,900
it's a weird lie because everyone knows it's not

4451
02:28:08,900 --> 02:28:10,900
if he said mid-march though I'm saying that the release date

4452
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:12,900
the book is released February 18th

4453
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:14,900
that's very soon

4454
02:28:14,900 --> 02:28:16,900
I know because

4455
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:18,900
I think they are going to be in mid-march

4456
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:20,900
so I'm wondering if he has another story

4457
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:22,900
yeah but imagine you have a book coming out in February

4458
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:24,900
then you have a relance

4459
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:26,900
a rebound

4460
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:28,900
of promotion

4461
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:30,900
I get that part

4462
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:32,900
but I've never seen the Times do that

4463
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,900
without something in tandem in the paper

4464
02:28:34,900 --> 02:28:36,900
and I've checked and that's every episode

4465
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:38,900
of the Daily has like a

4466
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:40,900
unless it's like a

4467
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:42,900
political rally or something

4468
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:44,900
yes the last time you did it

4469
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:46,900
with a different podcast there was the story about the Hitch Bank

4470
02:28:46,900 --> 02:28:48,900
and I was commemorating and he promoted the book

4471
02:28:48,900 --> 02:28:50,900
we didn't say anything about us

4472
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:52,900
so he already did one right

4473
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:54,900
okay so maybe you're right about the rebound then

4474
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:56,900
yes of course

4475
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:58,900
I just feel like he's going to have another story

4476
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:00,900
it's possible we'll see

4477
02:29:00,900 --> 02:29:02,900
he'll just copy and paste from the book

4478
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:04,900
he's going to do the same though

4479
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:06,900
he's going to do like the first one

4480
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:08,900
what are you talking about

4481
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:10,900
first person, immersive

4482
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:12,900
I apologize

4483
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:14,900
that would be fantastic

4484
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:16,900
it's going to be the same month as my book

4485
02:29:16,900 --> 02:29:18,900
this benefits you David

4486
02:29:18,900 --> 02:29:20,900
this helps your books

4487
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:22,900
arguing, it's fun

4488
02:29:22,900 --> 02:29:24,900
readers will listen and they'll say oh my god

4489
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:26,900
Foul's an asshole or David's an asshole

4490
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:28,900
whatever but the fact is they're talking

4491
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:30,900
about it and they're like oh let's see

4492
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:32,900
about this book maybe we can find out more

4493
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:34,900
alright so maybe the book isn't

4494
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:36,900
good enough or interesting enough

4495
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:38,900
and so maybe you need this little fiasco

4496
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:40,900
to help some bookstores

4497
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:42,900
who knows I'm just

4498
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:44,900
I'm not saying it's true I'm just spitballing here

4499
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:46,900
maybe this is going to benefit you in that way

4500
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:48,900
maybe you said let's go out to California

4501
02:29:48,900 --> 02:29:50,900
and have Foul yell at me because this can be

4502
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:52,900
critical to see

4503
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:54,900
maybe no you mean this

4504
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:56,900
yes maybe I can get Foul again

4505
02:29:56,900 --> 02:29:58,900
you know put him in his place

4506
02:29:58,900 --> 02:30:00,900
I mean Foul's a no good dude

4507
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:02,900
is it

4508
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:04,900
idiotic drug addict asshole

4509
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:06,900
I mean whatever the fuck you've said about me

4510
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:08,900
you probably

4511
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:10,900
didn't do any research

4512
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:12,900
or doesn't care

4513
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,900
he's probably going to wake up to you

4514
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:16,900
he's always David coming today I forgot all about it

4515
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:18,900
and then you can do whatever the fuck you want

4516
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:20,900
I predicted there's going to be a camera failure

4517
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:22,900
he didn't he said 10%

4518
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:24,900
you're right that's true

4519
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,900
I predicted there'd be a camera failure

4520
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:28,900
I said no he didn't he said there'd be a 10% chance

4521
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:30,900
because you're right I did

4522
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:32,900
it's good if you got him

4523
02:30:32,900 --> 02:30:34,900
I said

4524
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:36,900
do you want to know how I describe you to

4525
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:38,900
strongest man

4526
02:30:38,900 --> 02:30:40,900
I was like were you talking about it

4527
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:42,900
he's like yeah we were

4528
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:44,900
because the daily always does that stuff

4529
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:46,900
we're in the car we're arriving at the Vogue Schmidt's house

4530
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:48,900
like I asked him if we did that

4531
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:50,900
and he's like yeah yeah we did that

4532
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:52,900
so I know that I know they're going to include it

4533
02:30:52,900 --> 02:30:54,900
but they kind of have to include me asking them

4534
02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:56,900
too if they're going to talk about

4535
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:58,900
the film crew you know like

4536
02:30:58,900 --> 02:31:00,900
so I hope they give me some promotion

4537
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:02,900
that's why you need to look

4538
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:04,900
intelligent, articulate

4539
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:06,900
charismatic and charming

4540
02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:08,900
where is that in the profile

4541
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:10,900
why is that not in the profile

4542
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:12,900
I get to think that some of those words

4543
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:14,900
feel like are in the profile

4544
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:16,900
it's not

4545
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:18,900
not one compliment or nice

4546
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:20,900
everything a pejority

4547
02:31:20,900 --> 02:31:22,900
we went through friends with every single fucking word you wrote

4548
02:31:22,900 --> 02:31:24,900
you didn't say one time

4549
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:26,900
I don't think that's true

4550
02:31:26,900 --> 02:31:28,900
did you read what we sent you

4551
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:30,900
we went through it word for word

4552
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:32,900
can you show me one nice word

4553
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:34,900
can you show me one time Dini said

4554
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:36,900
if you just told him I'm sure I can

4555
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:38,900
okay do it

4556
02:31:38,900 --> 02:31:40,900
I don't have internet

4557
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:42,900
I'm not walking to your house

4558
02:31:42,900 --> 02:31:44,900
ladies and gentlemen of the world

4559
02:31:44,900 --> 02:31:46,900
the wifi password here is

4560
02:31:46,900 --> 02:31:48,900
Olive Airplane 370

4561
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:50,900
I'm not allowed to have your wifi thanks

4562
02:31:50,900 --> 02:31:52,900
that's the smartest thing you said on that

4563
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:54,900
you want to have the air flow

4564
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:56,900
on your device

4565
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:58,900
I'm happy

4566
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:00,900
I'm happy

4567
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:02,900
I'm happy

4568
02:32:02,900 --> 02:32:04,900
I just realized that was good

4569
02:32:04,900 --> 02:32:06,900
now you have the Russians

4570
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:08,900
you have the Russians don't you

4571
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:10,900
I'm happy

4572
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:12,900
he probably

4573
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:14,900
he probably completely

4574
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:16,900
didn't do any research or

4575
02:32:16,900 --> 02:32:18,900
doesn't care he's probably going to wake up and tell you

4576
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:20,900
it's Dave you're coming today I forgot all about it

4577
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:22,900
and then you can do whatever the fuck you want

4578
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:24,900
I predicted there's going to be a camera for you

4579
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:26,900
you're right

4580
02:32:26,900 --> 02:32:28,900
that's true

4581
02:32:28,900 --> 02:32:30,900
do you want to know how I describe you to

4582
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:32,900
strangers

4583
02:32:32,900 --> 02:32:34,900
intelligent, articulate

4584
02:32:34,900 --> 02:32:36,900
charismatic

4585
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:38,900
and charming

4586
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:40,900
why is that not in the profile

4587
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:42,900
I usually think that some of those words

4588
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:44,900
are in the profile

4589
02:32:44,900 --> 02:32:46,900
it's not

4590
02:32:46,900 --> 02:32:48,900
not one compliment

4591
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:50,900
or nice everything of the choreo

4592
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:52,900
we went through friends of the every single fucking word

4593
02:32:52,900 --> 02:32:54,900
you wrote

4594
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:56,900
I don't think that's true

4595
02:32:56,900 --> 02:32:58,900
did you read what we sent you

4596
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:00,900
we went through it word for word

4597
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:02,900
can you show me one nice word

4598
02:33:02,900 --> 02:33:04,900
can you show me one thing you said

4599
02:33:04,900 --> 02:33:06,900
I'm sure I can

4600
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:08,900
I don't have internet

4601
02:33:08,900 --> 02:33:10,900
you don't have internet

4602
02:33:10,900 --> 02:33:12,900
ladies and gentlemen of the world

4603
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:14,900
the wifi password here

4604
02:33:14,900 --> 02:33:16,900
is oliveairplane370

4605
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:18,900
I'm not allowed to have your wifi

4606
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:20,900
thanks

4607
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:22,900
that's the smartest thing you said on that

4608
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:24,900
you learned the article on your

4609
02:33:24,900 --> 02:33:26,900
on your device

4610
02:33:26,900 --> 02:33:28,900
I'm happy

4611
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:30,900
I'm happy

4612
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:32,900
see that's funny

4613
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:34,900
it's only funny when it's on camera

4614
02:33:34,900 --> 02:33:36,900
what were you saying

4615
02:33:36,900 --> 02:33:38,900
there's tennis in this picture

4616
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:40,900
you say you describe this

4617
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:42,900
these time words

4618
02:33:42,900 --> 02:33:44,900
this is how you describe me

4619
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:46,900
that's not how you describe it to the world

4620
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:48,900
maybe in private you say this

4621
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:50,900
this is the world

4622
02:33:50,900 --> 02:33:52,900
this isn't just

4623
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:54,900
Ricky Dinky's spot in Swaziland

4624
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:56,900
like I said before

4625
02:33:56,900 --> 02:33:58,900
or even a regional paper

4626
02:33:58,900 --> 02:34:00,900
or just America

4627
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:02,900
this is the world

4628
02:34:02,900 --> 02:34:04,900
billions of people

4629
02:34:04,900 --> 02:34:06,900
and you're careless

4630
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:08,900
you fucked up

4631
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:12,900
and you will pay the consequences of that

4632
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:14,900
whatever that looks like

4633
02:34:14,900 --> 02:34:16,900
you know

4634
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:18,900
and I'm angry

4635
02:34:18,900 --> 02:34:20,900
obviously

4636
02:34:20,900 --> 02:34:22,900
so

4637
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,900
I would love to talk about my father

4638
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:26,900
but I can't do it

4639
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:28,900
we should come back

4640
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:30,900
tomorrow do you think

4641
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:32,900
there's a little earlier

4642
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:34,900
we can do like noon

4643
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:36,900
maybe 11 let's try for 11

4644
02:34:36,900 --> 02:34:38,900
I don't have to do it 11

4645
02:34:38,900 --> 02:34:40,900
so there's

4646
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:42,900
I could do

4647
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:44,900
that's probably the best

4648
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:46,900
yeah

4649
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:48,900
we don't want to take up your whole day

4650
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:50,900
we don't want to try to

4651
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:52,900
are you taking up more than a day

4652
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:54,900
well Eric hasn't done anything

4653
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:56,900
no

4654
02:34:56,900 --> 02:34:58,900
it's taking up five years of my life

4655
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:00,900
well actually David's only taken up two and a half

4656
02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:02,900
but yes

4657
02:35:02,900 --> 02:35:04,900
I think I can do another day

4658
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:06,900
okay so let's find for noon

4659
02:35:06,900 --> 02:35:08,900
tomorrow

4660
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:10,900
okay

4661
02:35:10,900 --> 02:35:12,900
I mean do you have any questions for me

4662
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:14,900
that you want to

4663
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:16,900
I didn't really do any background

4664
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:18,900
I mean just about what we want

4665
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:20,900
from you or what the hopes

4666
02:35:20,900 --> 02:35:22,900
for the story are

4667
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:24,900
basically

4668
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:26,900
we

4669
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,900
we generally don't show people

4670
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:30,900
our list of questions but the thrust of the story

4671
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:32,900
is your childhood

4672
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:34,900
your relationship to your dad

4673
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:36,900
how you came to understand his role

4674
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:38,900
at Deutsche Bank when you were young

4675
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:40,900
obviously when you were talking about

4676
02:35:40,900 --> 02:35:42,900
your suicide

4677
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:44,900
you discovering that

4678
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:46,900
and then basically the thrust of the episode

4679
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:48,900
is you trying to figure out

4680
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:50,900
or trying to get a satisfactory answer

4681
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:52,900
a satisfactory as you can

4682
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:54,900
for why he killed himself

4683
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:56,900
and then along the way

4684
02:35:56,900 --> 02:35:58,900
we're learning things about Deutsche Bank

4685
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:00,900
and about things that are in the news

4686
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:02,900
do you have that certain in you

4687
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:04,900
sure

4688
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:06,900
okay

4689
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:08,900
this makes sense

4690
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:10,900
okay

4691
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:12,900
this makes sense because he says they have breaking news

4692
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:14,900
so this will be

4693
02:36:14,900 --> 02:36:16,900
you'll be one of many characters that are

4694
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:18,900
around the book but

4695
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:20,900
it will probably be a second wave

4696
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:22,900
what do you say? there'll be a breaking news that

4697
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:24,900
somehow this podcast fits around

4698
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:26,900
where do you get that from?

4699
02:36:26,900 --> 02:36:28,900
because he says your breaking news is short

4700
02:36:28,900 --> 02:36:30,900
what does he say?

4701
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:32,900
I ask him do you want some breaking news as well?

4702
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:34,900
yeah sure

4703
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:36,900
I think you may

4704
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:38,900
but also before you hit play

4705
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:40,900
why don't you get Scott some breaking news tomorrow?

4706
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:42,900
well before any news breaks

4707
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:44,900
the reason what we said to him

4708
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:46,900
you think all of us at the Georgia

4709
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:48,900
we didn't say one nice thing which is true

4710
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:50,900
we went through it word by word

4711
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:52,900
and then I said didn't you get what we sent you

4712
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:54,900
because you probably don't understand what that is

4713
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:56,900
so we went through it word by word

4714
02:36:56,900 --> 02:36:58,900
and we wrote everything out

4715
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:00,900
like what is mischaracterization

4716
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:02,900
what is accurate and what's inaccurate

4717
02:37:02,900 --> 02:37:04,900
and we sent it to him

4718
02:37:04,900 --> 02:37:06,900
and to Nick Summers

4719
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:08,900
and his editor and other women

4720
02:37:08,900 --> 02:37:10,900
which I guess is on another

4721
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:12,900
the one you didn't bring

4722
02:37:12,900 --> 02:37:14,900
the part you didn't bring

4723
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:16,900
it must be all in there and when we talked about her

4724
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:18,900
yeah I remember that

4725
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:20,900
so we'll give that to you too if you want it

4726
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:22,900
and how much time before

4727
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:24,900
they came did you send to a week?

4728
02:37:24,900 --> 02:37:26,900
right after the article

4729
02:37:26,900 --> 02:37:28,900
not to the daily though

4730
02:37:28,900 --> 02:37:30,900
you sent it to

4731
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:32,900
and as a people

4732
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:34,900
I thought you were sending it to the producer before he came

4733
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:36,900
no no no

4734
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:38,900
David is not that for three months

4735
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:40,900
after the article

4736
02:37:40,900 --> 02:37:42,900
was published in your times

4737
02:37:42,900 --> 02:37:44,900
we went through it and we sent it to David

4738
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,900
and his editors

4739
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:48,900
yeah and that's when you had the call about like oh technically

4740
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:50,900
yes yes yes

4741
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:52,900
okay I understand

4742
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:54,900
we're trying to get a satisfactory answer

4743
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:56,900
as satisfactory as you can

4744
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:58,900
for why he killed himself

4745
02:37:58,900 --> 02:38:00,900
and then you know along the way

4746
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:02,900
we're learning things about Deutsche Bank

4747
02:38:02,900 --> 02:38:04,900
and about things that are in the news

4748
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:06,900
do you have that statement?

4749
02:38:06,900 --> 02:38:08,900
sure

4750
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:10,900
I don't know

4751
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:12,900
but I'll give it to you

4752
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:14,900
can I say anything to finish?

4753
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:16,900
I'm sorry I've interjected too many times

4754
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:18,900
and stopped myself many times

4755
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:22,900
we've had many conversations

4756
02:38:22,900 --> 02:38:24,900
many

4757
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:26,900
and you put me

4758
02:38:26,900 --> 02:38:28,900
one time in the book

4759
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:30,900
I'm only in three pages

4760
02:38:30,900 --> 02:38:32,900
in the book

4761
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:34,900
and the only quote I've decided to use

4762
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:36,900
is a negative quote which I don't even

4763
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:38,900
think

4764
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:40,900
I've said

4765
02:38:40,900 --> 02:38:42,900
I know exactly what you're talking about

4766
02:38:42,900 --> 02:38:44,900
and of all the things

4767
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:46,900
I've told you about

4768
02:38:46,900 --> 02:38:48,900
that's what you've decided to put

4769
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:50,900
everything

4770
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:52,900
the first day I met you at that cafe

4771
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:54,900
in New York

4772
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:56,900
beautiful things about him

4773
02:38:56,900 --> 02:38:58,900
and our meeting and everything

4774
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:00,900
and at that time

4775
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:02,900
some red flags really came to my head

4776
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:04,900
because you said

4777
02:39:04,900 --> 02:39:06,900
well you're the first person that has

4778
02:39:06,900 --> 02:39:08,900
so many positive things to say about

4779
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:10,900
and I was like

4780
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:12,900
oh that's odd

4781
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:14,900
first of all

4782
02:39:14,900 --> 02:39:16,900
why would you say that to me?

4783
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:18,900
if it was true

4784
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:20,900
why would you say that to a woman

4785
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:22,900
that is telling you about

4786
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:24,900
that and she's enamored

4787
02:39:24,900 --> 02:39:26,900
I mean that's

4788
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:28,900
disturbing

4789
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:30,900
and over

4790
02:39:30,900 --> 02:39:32,900
the last two years

4791
02:39:32,900 --> 02:39:34,900
I've told you so many good things about him

4792
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:36,900
and you've only chosen

4793
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:38,900
one sentence

4794
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:40,900
that says

4795
02:39:40,900 --> 02:39:42,900
nothing about our relationship

4796
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:44,900
or about who he is

4797
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:46,900
and I've given you some insight about

4798
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:48,900
him and his personality I think

4799
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:50,900
you have Marie

4800
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:52,900
a lot of our conversations have been off the record

4801
02:39:52,900 --> 02:39:54,900
no that's not true

4802
02:39:54,900 --> 02:39:56,900
really? are you saying our conversations

4803
02:39:56,900 --> 02:39:58,900
have all been on the record?

4804
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:00,900
when was the last time we spoke?

4805
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:02,900
I had not

4806
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:04,900
your email after mine

4807
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:06,900
it's like obviously we've been chatting

4808
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:08,900
and obviously you

4809
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:10,900
putting all the

4810
02:40:10,900 --> 02:40:12,900
negative things in there

4811
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:14,900
that makes you also

4812
02:40:14,900 --> 02:40:16,900
Marie if you want our conversations to all be on the record

4813
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:18,900
that's fine but they're not right now

4814
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:20,900
and you should just

4815
02:40:20,900 --> 02:40:22,900
is that why you decided

4816
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:24,900
of all the conversations we've had

4817
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:26,900
you've decided to use

4818
02:40:26,900 --> 02:40:28,900
a quote that is negative

4819
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:30,900
about how?

4820
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:32,900
I don't think the quote was negative about that

4821
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:34,900
what was the quote? something to be effective

4822
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:36,900
right when you first met

4823
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:38,900
he sleeps all day is depressed

4824
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:40,900
I thought the quote you were referring to

4825
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:42,900
is he thought that

4826
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:44,900
sleeping with his mom's best friend

4827
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:46,900
was a good way to get back at her

4828
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:48,900
you told me that

4829
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:50,900
that's another bullshit

4830
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:52,900
you told me that

4831
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:54,900
I read the book

4832
02:40:54,900 --> 02:40:56,900
that's in the book

4833
02:40:56,900 --> 02:40:58,900
no it's in the first part of the epilogue

4834
02:40:58,900 --> 02:41:00,900
I read the book

4835
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:02,900
you're referring to this

4836
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:06,900
well the book hasn't been

4837
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:08,900
David we went through the different versions

4838
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:10,900
you added just a few paragraphs

4839
02:41:10,900 --> 02:41:12,900
it's exactly the same copy I have

4840
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:14,900
in the epilogue

4841
02:41:14,900 --> 02:41:16,900
I'm in the epilogue

4842
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:18,900
in three pages and

4843
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:20,900
one quote that you use for me

4844
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:22,900
and that you know with what it's by me

4845
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:24,900
is the negative one

4846
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:26,900
I think it's all good

4847
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:28,900
she's saying she feels like you

4848
02:41:28,900 --> 02:41:30,900
I understand what you're saying

4849
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:32,900
you just represented her

4850
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:34,900
my feelings please

4851
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:36,900
you picked only negative things to further your agenda

4852
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:38,900
of feigning a negative fortune

4853
02:41:38,900 --> 02:41:40,900
is what she's trying to do

4854
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:42,900
I shared my feelings for you

4855
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:44,900
and you didn't use them

4856
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:46,900
I mean there's only one sentence

4857
02:41:46,900 --> 02:41:48,900
I think it is

4858
02:41:48,900 --> 02:41:50,900
clear when you're living with someone

4859
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:52,900
and you're in a serious relationship with them

4860
02:41:52,900 --> 02:41:54,900
that you love them

4861
02:41:54,900 --> 02:41:56,900
no it's not

4862
02:41:56,900 --> 02:41:58,900
yes it is

4863
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:00,900
and you don't show

4864
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:02,900
I don't

4865
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:06,900
so it's

4866
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:08,900
you're saying the reader who can read between the lines

4867
02:42:08,900 --> 02:42:10,900
when the only quote I have

4868
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:12,900
is a negative one

4869
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:14,900
but she really loves him

4870
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:20,900
I'll let the book speak for itself

4871
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:22,900
I think that based on the feedback I've gotten

4872
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:24,900
so far from people who don't know you

4873
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:26,900
they think

4874
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:28,900
frankly I haven't asked about you

4875
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:30,900
but they think that you come off pretty well

4876
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:32,900
you're complicated and you're flawed the way you are

4877
02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:34,900
but they think you come off pretty well

4878
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:36,900
and if

4879
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:38,900
you've actually read the book

4880
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:40,900
that's being published as opposed to whatever you've looked at in the past

4881
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:42,900
exact same book

4882
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:44,900
well I don't know, I can't answer that

4883
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:48,900
you don't even need to, it doesn't really matter to me

4884
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:50,900
there's

4885
02:42:50,900 --> 02:42:52,900
the version of the book that is being published

4886
02:42:52,900 --> 02:42:54,900
which

4887
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:56,900
all I can say is I stand by it

4888
02:42:56,900 --> 02:42:58,900
I'm proud of it

4889
02:42:58,900 --> 02:43:00,900
and I think it reflects you

4890
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:02,900
you're a protagonist

4891
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:04,900
along with your father

4892
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:06,900
you're probably the main protagonists

4893
02:43:06,900 --> 02:43:08,900
and I'm proud of it

4894
02:43:08,900 --> 02:43:10,900
but it wouldn't have happened without you

4895
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:12,900
I'm really really grateful

4896
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:14,900
for

4897
02:43:14,900 --> 02:43:16,900
the work you provided for

4898
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:18,900
to help you provide it

4899
02:43:18,900 --> 02:43:20,900
and

4900
02:43:20,900 --> 02:43:22,900
yeah and it honestly

4901
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:24,900
it pains me to

4902
02:43:24,900 --> 02:43:26,900
this is not a pleasant afternoon for me

4903
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:28,900
I was just not intended to be

4904
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:30,900
it already it pains me

4905
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:32,900
to know

4906
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:34,900
the anger and grief

4907
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:36,900
that you guys are feeling toward me

4908
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:38,900
and this afternoon

4909
02:43:38,900 --> 02:43:40,900
not toward you that you have caused

4910
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:42,900
you did it

4911
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:44,900
you caused this

4912
02:43:44,900 --> 02:43:46,900
you were careless, you caused this

4913
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:48,900
okay

4914
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:50,900
these are the consequences

4915
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:52,900
part of the consequences

4916
02:43:52,900 --> 02:43:54,900
it affects

4917
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:56,900
other people

4918
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:58,900
it affects me of course

4919
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:00,900
and then it ricochets

4920
02:44:00,900 --> 02:44:02,900
and it affects Marie

4921
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:04,900
child's life

4922
02:44:04,900 --> 02:44:06,900
and I feel awful about that

4923
02:44:06,900 --> 02:44:08,900
okay well mission accomplished

4924
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:10,900
do something about it

4925
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:12,900
no there's nothing

4926
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:14,900
look

4927
02:44:14,900 --> 02:44:16,900
guys I am

4928
02:44:16,900 --> 02:44:18,900
part of what we're doing here is the solution

4929
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:20,900
to this we want you

4930
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:22,900
in your own words

4931
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:24,900
to essentially tell your story

4932
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:26,900
it's a compelling story

4933
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:28,900
it's a story that I think belongs fully unfiltered

4934
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:30,900
out in the open for the public

4935
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:32,900
and we very much want that

4936
02:44:32,900 --> 02:44:34,900
that's something that service the daily

4937
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:36,900
can provide

4938
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:38,900
with your help

4939
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:40,900
that's we're not coming in here

4940
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:42,900
with any tricks of our sleeves

4941
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,900
and

4942
02:44:44,900 --> 02:44:46,900
we're eager to hear

4943
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:48,900
your story in your own words

4944
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:50,900
and that's what we're trying to say at the outset

4945
02:44:50,900 --> 02:44:52,900
before we started all this

4946
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:54,900
we want you to be

4947
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:56,900
we want this in your voice

4948
02:44:56,900 --> 02:44:58,900
so

4949
02:44:58,900 --> 02:45:00,900
let's try to say those words are you

4950
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:02,900
you've only interviewed him for two years

4951
02:45:04,900 --> 02:45:06,900
I've been interviewing him for six years

4952
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:08,900
or whatever

4953
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:10,900
okay

4954
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:12,900
alright you guys

4955
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:14,900
thank you

4956
02:45:14,900 --> 02:45:16,900
okay so what's the plan

4957
02:45:16,900 --> 02:45:18,900
12 o'clock tomorrow

4958
02:45:18,900 --> 02:45:20,900
okay

4959
02:45:20,900 --> 02:45:22,900
alright

4960
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:24,900
you're actually right

4961
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:26,900
can you guys

4962
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:28,900
can you guys

4963
02:45:28,900 --> 02:45:30,900
ask him

4964
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:32,900
ask him

4965
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:34,900
ask him

4966
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:36,900
as long as we're still rolling

4967
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:38,900
I'm not gonna

4968
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:40,900
oh no

4969
02:45:40,900 --> 02:45:42,900
there's more

4970
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:44,900
I'm sure there's another car there

4971
02:45:44,900 --> 02:45:46,900
what is the question

4972
02:45:46,900 --> 02:45:48,900
like 50 minutes to just transfer that

4973
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:50,900

4974
02:45:50,900 --> 02:45:52,900

4975
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:54,900
another one

4976
02:45:54,900 --> 02:45:56,900
another one is

4977
02:45:56,900 --> 02:45:58,900
these are other ones that were on there

4978
02:45:58,900 --> 02:46:00,900
what did I ask

4979
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:02,900
I don't remember

4980
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:04,900
do you remember what she asked

4981
02:46:04,900 --> 02:46:06,900
I don't

4982
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:08,900
if you

4983
02:46:08,900 --> 02:46:10,900
if you base your book

4984
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:12,900
on fraud

4985
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:14,900

02:46:14,900 --> 02:46:16,900

4987
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:18,900

02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:34,900
we'll be here tomorrow what time are you coming

5024
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:36,900
10

5025
02:47:36,900 --> 02:47:38,900
thank you

5026
02:47:38,900 --> 02:47:40,900
what time

5027
02:47:40,900 --> 02:47:42,900
10 30

5028
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:44,900
okay

5029
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:46,900
but

5030
02:47:46,900 --> 02:47:48,900
you know

5031
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:50,900
I got a lot of clarification from this

5032
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:52,900
I wanna talk about it tomorrow

5033
02:47:52,900 --> 02:47:54,900
cause now I know what to ask

5034
02:47:54,900 --> 02:47:56,900
cause it's too overwhelming to know

5035
02:47:56,900 --> 02:47:58,900
what to ask

5036
02:47:58,900 --> 02:48:00,900
a dispute because now I have to go to David

5037
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:02,900
and I'll make the same deal with David

5038
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:04,900
if he wants to watch over that footage

5039
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:06,900
cause I mean they have the audio

5040
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:08,900
but you know what I'm saying

5041
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:10,900
I think it's only fair

5042
02:48:10,900 --> 02:48:12,900
because that's how I wanna question him too

5043
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:14,900
two or three things that of my

5044
02:48:14,900 --> 02:48:16,900
you know of the way I'm looking at this story

5045
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:18,900
and again what I think you need to

5046
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:20,900
what I'm focused on

5047
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:22,900
what I'm gonna keep asking you and him

5048
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:24,900
is about these fraudulent pink ones

5049
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:26,900
because

5050
02:48:26,900 --> 02:48:28,900
Tom Bowers

5051
02:48:28,900 --> 02:48:30,900
um

5052
02:48:30,900 --> 02:48:32,900
and particularly now that we know that he was evicted

5053
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:34,900
and um

5054
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:36,900
you know depressed and

5055
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:38,900
helped him

5056
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:40,900
I got him calling his report today

5057
02:48:40,900 --> 02:48:42,900
but he helped him

5058
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:44,900
was he getting divorced?

5059
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:46,900
did you guys say I had to call him?

5060
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:48,900
yeah from Scott

5061
02:48:48,900 --> 02:48:50,900
did you get it?

5062
02:48:50,900 --> 02:48:52,900
no I didn't see it but I saw you tweeted

5063
02:48:52,900 --> 02:48:54,900
did it have anything surprising?

5064
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,900
I'll tell you tomorrow on the camera

5065
02:48:56,900 --> 02:48:58,900
okay

5066
02:48:58,900 --> 02:49:00,900
yeah

5067
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:02,900
yeah so you

5068
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:04,900
I mean actually I think this was necessary

5069
02:49:04,900 --> 02:49:06,900
it was

5070
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:08,900
it was and that's the thing

5071
02:49:08,900 --> 02:49:10,900
if it wasn't recorded by them

5072
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:12,900
and I understand

5073
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:14,900
that you didn't record it

5074
02:49:14,900 --> 02:49:16,900
and that's that you know it's not

5075
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:18,900
we do need to like I need to look at that with you

5076
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:20,900
because I don't I would have not caught

5077
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:22,900
I wouldn't be able to describe

5078
02:49:22,900 --> 02:49:24,900
the things that I need to

5079
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:26,900
ask questions about because there's such

5080
02:49:26,900 --> 02:49:28,900
is there something that I don't understand?

5081
02:49:28,900 --> 02:49:30,900
no

5082
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:32,900
not at all

5083
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:34,900
okay

5084
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:36,900
I'm just gonna go home

5085
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:38,900
there's not a footage of you and David

5086
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:40,900
chatting in the cafe

5087
02:49:40,900 --> 02:49:42,900
I wish

5088
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:44,900
I thought the camera would follow him out

5089
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:46,900
I wish

5090
02:49:46,900 --> 02:49:48,900
no I told him to stay on here

5091
02:49:48,900 --> 02:49:50,900
if I follow them out like I'm kind of creepy

5092
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:52,900
you know I'm already kind of creepy being here

5093
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:54,900
obviously

5094
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:56,900
one saying when David showing up

5095
02:49:56,900 --> 02:49:58,900
I was a little creepy you know I'm like

5096
02:49:58,900 --> 02:50:00,900
I told him

5097
02:50:00,900 --> 02:50:02,900
I told him I'd leave

5098
02:50:02,900 --> 02:50:04,900
you were talking documentary

5099
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:06,900
well look

5100
02:50:06,900 --> 02:50:08,900
you know the good thing

5101
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:10,900
the case of that is like

5102
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:12,900
I could have called I had three choices

5103
02:50:12,900 --> 02:50:14,900
I could have called David and went up and said

5104
02:50:14,900 --> 02:50:16,900
hey I'm doing this doc and Val

5105
02:50:16,900 --> 02:50:18,900
Val doesn't want me to tell you about it

5106
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:20,900
and then I wouldn't have anything to shoot because you tell me to fuck off

5107
02:50:20,900 --> 02:50:22,900
I could have

5108
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:24,900
you know I asked you

5109
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:26,900
you're not gonna tell him and

5110
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:28,900
the third way is when he comes like

5111
02:50:28,900 --> 02:50:30,900
you know

5112
02:50:30,900 --> 02:50:32,900
call his bluff I guess

5113
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:34,900
he didn't even have to

5114
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:36,900
he wanted to mic up

5115
02:50:36,900 --> 02:50:38,900
so I'm glad that it worked out that way

5116
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:40,900
well I mean

5117
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:42,900
he wants it on record obviously

5118
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:44,900
we also did not

5119
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:46,900
it was going to happen

5120
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,900
he thought he could win

5121
02:50:48,900 --> 02:50:50,900
he had no idea we'd get

5122
02:50:50,900 --> 02:50:52,900
buried

5123
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:54,900
David's ego there is very arrogant

5124
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:56,900
he thought he could win

5125
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:58,900
of course

5126
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:00,900
he thinks he's in the right

5127
02:51:00,900 --> 02:51:02,900
he thinks he's a trap

5128
02:51:02,900 --> 02:51:04,900
he doesn't think there's a trap

5129
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:06,900
he's a trap

5130
02:51:06,900 --> 02:51:08,900
well I mean I didn't want it to be a trap

5131
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:10,900
he could say get the fuck out of here

5132
02:51:10,900 --> 02:51:12,900
I think it's interesting I don't think it

5133
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:14,900
I think what comes out of this is

5134
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:16,900
you know he'll sell maybe

5135
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:18,900
a couple more books

5136
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:20,900
you have your story told

5137
02:51:20,900 --> 02:51:22,900
and you know

5138
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:24,900
how can anyone be all that upset about it

5139
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:26,900
either way everyone gets a little bit more of what they want

5140
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:28,900
hopefully though

5141
02:51:28,900 --> 02:51:30,900
there are some of these loan documents

5142
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:32,900
and there's a whole different

5143
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:34,900
story

5144
02:51:34,900 --> 02:51:36,900
that's kind of what is needed

5145
02:51:36,900 --> 02:51:38,900
to happen at real time
