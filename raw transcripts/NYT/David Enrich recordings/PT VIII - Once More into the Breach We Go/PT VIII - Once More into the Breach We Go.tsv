0	5820	Okay, okay. He calls you and asks what you've got in Trump. You say you really
5820	10920	don't know. Right. He agrees to pay ten grand, half upfront, half on delivery for
10920	15840	everything. Pretty quick conversation. Glenn doesn't want to be on an unsecured
15840	22000	phone line. No, he's very paranoid. Yeah, and wants to switch to signal. Yeah. And so
22000	26000	I've seen those signal messages. He says let's get you here ASAP, please come.
26000	29360	There's some discussion about where your grenades should go. You settle on
29360	35120	St. Thomas. 5,000 bucks arrives in your PayPal account. He gives you an amix
35120	41600	number to book plane tickets. You go to St. Thomas. The 5,000 arrives in St. Thomas.
41600	45360	So first he just gives me the car car number. Well, he offers. No, I don't think
45360	49600	that's right. Yeah, yeah, he offers to send. We'll check that. Okay. There's because
49600	54560	I've looked at these times and you've showed me the PayPal receipt or the
54560	57880	anyway, we'll come back to that. But that's some pretty sure that was in St. Thomas
57920	62080	after he and his tech guy looked over the files. Then he said, okay, then they
62080	68800	sent the 5,000. And it doesn't matter. There's you got the 5,000. Before you
68800	73920	get to St. Thomas, Glenn asked for some research on specific topics. He says any
73920	84880	Russian stuff at all. He is looking for stuff on Rentec and Mercer. And then he
84880	88880	said you say you appreciate you've got that stuff. And but it's gonna take a
88880	93680	lot of digging to find it. He says be safe and I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, you're
93680	99040	feeling pretty proud and excited. This is like higher level clandestine work than
99040	104480	you've been previously doing. Glenn is a celebrity a little bit. Yeah. Okay, I
104480	113280	call Peggy too. Okay. So it's a good Peggy come back in the story here. Okay. And
113280	119160	if you want to make a note for Peggy's, but chronologically, yes. Okay, St. Thomas.
119160	127920	Glenn comes with a computer dude. Yeah. You alternate between going through all
127920	132240	the stuff in the hotel suite. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. You all were in a suite
132240	136760	together, right? No. I had my own and they had one in a different building down
136760	140120	the hall. But in the same hotel? In the same hotel. Okay. And whose hotel suite were you
140120	145680	working in? Mine. Okay. And it so you alternate between that and you spend a
145680	149120	bunch of time out at a picnic table on the beach, drinking beers, smoking cigarettes.
149120	160160	Yeah, and it took me to Strip Club. Okay. Yeah, dirty weird Strip Club. Okay, you've
160200	165800	described Glenn as manic. Unable to sit still, chattering constantly about Trump
165800	171400	and about fusions, financial struggles. He said he told you. He told me everything
171400	175480	wasn't just that. Well, but you got into. Slightly manic. I wouldn't say over it
175480	179440	because manic is a strong word too. Okay, I'll say slightly manic. Yeah. Slightly.
180440	191240	Paranoid. Quite paranoid. Okay. So he told you that any kind of dirt you could turn
191240	197560	up on Mercer, or Rentec, or Trump, or Deutsche could be valuable to him, to his
197560	205560	current or prospective future clients. Yeah. Okay. And he at one point. He sold me
205560	209440	because he knew I did not like Trump. He saw my tweets. And so he knew I was
209440	214320	anti Trump. So he said it's it would be helpful for him to learn about how the
214320	218080	funding Mercer funded the Trump campaign and any connection the Deutsche Bank had
218080	223120	the Trump and the connection between Mercer and Deutsche Bank. And Rentec was
223120	227200	its own entity. If anything on Rentec, fine, but it was mostly Mercer was a
227200	234240	focus. Mostly Mercer. Yeah, Rentec is secondary. Well, Mercer is Rentec. I know.
234240	241040	Well, not really. Mercer had, on his own, whatever his foundation is, gave that
241040	245400	money to Trump. Rentec did not give the money to Trump. Yeah. So in that sense.
245400	250640	Okay, so you're going through all this stuff. You don't actually find a whole
250640	254440	lot in Bill T. Millall concerts. No, as you knew already, there are no mentions of
254440	258320	Trump. No. There is a lot of Rentec stuff. Yeah, there's a lot. Well, that's a
258320	261840	competitive. The name Mercer hardly comes up at all. There's lots of
261920	266000	Rentec stuff. But most of that, it doesn't really shed new light beyond. He's a
266000	271280	Senate Bob Roach and his crew have already turned up so much. So you spend a
271280	276800	few days there and then Glenn invites you to come back to Washington with him.
276800	281200	Yeah. And you agree? Yeah. And you fly separately to avoid a
281200	287880	razmine suspicion. At Dulles, you get a text. I don't know if that's true, but it
287920	293280	could be. What? Fly separately to not a razmine suspicion. The only reason I
293280	296200	have that in here is because you told me. Really? So if you don't, if you're not
296200	299560	sure about that, I shouldn't have. I'm not sure, but sounds good. That's fine. No, no, no,
299560	303720	that's, they, because Glenn said he had to go back for something first. So he only
303720	307520	stayed a few days and then went back to hold still, hold tight here while we
307520	312880	figure out what to do next. Okay. You get to Dulles, he sends you a text with an
312880	315960	address for you to come to. But keep in mind, there's a lot going on in this
316040	320920	hotel. There's this convention. Yeah. But it's not really that interesting on the
320920	324960	grand scheme of things because it's just like a, it's a National Guard meeting. I
324960	328800	think there was National Security Services. No, it's National Guard. I've looked at
328800	332320	your picture of the. There was a lot. There was, well, it was one ballroom. There
332320	336800	was every single ballroom had different government agency attached to it. There's
336800	341400	all government people. Certainly all the different government agencies listed on
341400	345800	that thing. On that specific one. But there was, again, that's a huge
345880	347840	hotel with a lot of these rooms.
350720	354920	Just to be sure you can find some research, find out what was going on in
354920	358440	that hotel. I'm sure there's evidence online.
360200	366040	Okay. So you get to Glenn's house, brings you to a guest room. Next morning, you
366040	371120	get this great up close view of his paranoia. You're on the front porch
371160	377720	smoking a Marlboro. He comes out notices a small rip in one of the window
377720	381000	screens and says, why are you messing with my window? Did you sneak out last
381000	386200	night? Right. You say no. Well, no, it was more like, you know, what did you, did
386200	389600	you meet somebody last night? Did you come out of the house? Because sneaking
389600	393640	out is like, you know, I'm just kidding. But it's more like, did you, did you
393640	398000	have a rendezvous with someone? There was a car I saw coming around the car in
398000	404160	the house. I heard some noises. I heard the car speed off. I heard the door
404160	409280	closed and open. Did you meet somebody? Did you in the middle of the night? No,
409280	413640	of course not. Okay. And he said, he kind of eyes you suspiciously and says,
413640	417440	let's see what the video shows. Yeah, he points to the camera, which I knew was
417440	422920	there. And there was a terror in the, in the screen, in front of the screen. Okay.
422920	428160	So he brings you into his office and there shows you the, the video feed. I
428160	431280	wrote you this whole story. Yeah, no, I'm just, I'm just making sure we got this
431280	437400	right. So he in the video shows his son trying to pry the screen off the window
437400	443080	to get it drunk in late. Um, and so he kind of Glenn kind of relaxes a little
443080	448440	bit at that point. He doesn't view you for Glenn. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you never
448440	453000	apologize. Yeah, I've got that. So a couple of nights, you spend a couple nights
453000	459120	there. Yeah. Then you go up to his secluded house in the countryside down
459120	463920	a long dirt lane with a force in one side and a river on the other. Yeah. A few
463920	468760	boats moored at the Flood and Dock. Yeah. You spend a long time repairing wooden
468760	473400	fence. Yeah. Trumpets through the mud. Yeah. Writing ATVs in the wood. Yeah.
473680	481320	Drinking a lot. Yeah. Beer and liquor. Beer and liquor. He has a case of beer and he had a bunch of booze and
481320	485600	that kind of thing. Yeah. You talked about Trump. Yeah. You talked about Christopher
485600	492280	Steele. Yeah. You talked about your father's. Yeah. Okay. You told Glenn about
492280	500920	your story and he told you about his story. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. Glenn's
500960	513360	hired a retired Deutsche Auditor. Okay. And here I go into stuff about that spreadsheet,
513360	530680	which is how we started all these videos. Right. Okay. So there's, this is when Glenn,
530760	538680	so you go back to Washington and Glenn starts sending you out to meet people. So first up is
538680	549920	Bob Roach. Right. And let's see. Glenn tells Roach, I'd really like you to look at this.
550480	554400	And Roach is happy to do so. It seems like an interesting opportunity. So one afternoon,
554400	559600	you show up at the Dirksen building. You, by the way, this might have been Stan,
559600	565640	the Beacon Hotel. Yeah. Okay. Charging room service. No room service. No room service.
565640	571240	Yeah. Glenn made it clear. Don't use room service on my card. So I said, okay, I will not use room
571240	579600	service on your card. Okay. Um, I never did. Sure about that. Is that the only reason I have that
579600	585400	in here is because I told you specifically, Glenn said to me, do not use room service on this card.
585840	590640	You can, this is for the room only. You pay for the food and stuff and just don't use the room
590640	594400	service because I don't want to get out of hand. I said, okay. I never use room service on that
594400	600160	card. Um, so how are we paying for food and stuff while you're there? Oh, he gave me five
600160	605720	grand. Okay. And then the other money came in too. With what other money? The BG money. Okay.
605720	617240	Okay. So you go to Roach's office and he's got this bundle of printouts for you with a bunch of
617240	625320	news articles and other stuff. And he tells you that he's looking for a Trump connection to Russia
625320	633840	by way of Deutsche Bank. Bob Roach? Yes. And he says he's also very interested in anything I have
634160	644520	especially in the stress test stuff as well. And he said he was putting together a, I don't know if
644520	647840	it was a book because he had a bunch of books he'd written or showed me. I know, so those are
647840	653160	sending oversight hearings he had done. It's like 16-0. He was together some kind of project where
653160	659360	he was looking at all the times regulators were asking Deutsche Bank to do something and they
659360	665400	either never responded or bullshit responded or responded to do something and never followed up
665400	672680	on it. So if I had any instances of that, it would be very helpful for him personally. Okay.
672680	680240	Then we talked about Mercer. He told me about meeting Mercer. And the discussion was how does
680240	687480	he make this money? And the medallion fund versus the public fund is incredibly disproportionate
687640	700200	of the profits. It's ridiculous. 23 billion split between 100 and three people. So we figured,
700200	705320	I think this actually meant Matt Mosk for us now because that's why I brought up the Ponzi scheme
705320	710080	idea. But he said he sat down and spoke with Mercer and Mercer explained to him that he had
710840	718960	adapted an algorithm for speech recognition for the stock markets. And Bob Roach is so confident,
718960	723920	like that's clearly what it is. And I'm hearing it's like, this is what you tell an idiot when
723920	729000	you want to just say something fintechy and then everyone that doesn't understand anything about
729000	734280	algorithms or computers, oh yes, of course, that must be it. And I couldn't believe that Bob Roach
734440	739480	bought this slide. I was like, Bob, like, come on, think about it. If this had happened, I mean,
739480	742920	maybe in the 90s, when people, the markets would have been cornered by millions of people. He's
742920	747400	not the only person in the world. I mean, these ideas just think it's not one person that has this
747400	752760	idea that they're naturally come up together, like a paradigm shift or zeitgeist ideas happen
752760	756040	like this. You know, it's not just he's been holding onto this since the 90s. It's bullshit.
756040	761560	No one can corner a market because of a fucking algorithm that they wrote. It's like the Bad
761640	765800	James Bond film. He's like, no, I really believe he's he was a military intelligence. I don't
765800	770280	care if he's a military intelligence. It's bullshit. It can't it's not happening. It's not what the
770280	776200	real story is. We had it. I don't want you to come to their entire business. Ransom's entire business
776200	782200	is designing very sophisticated trading strategies based on finding little inefficiencies in the
782200	788840	market based on algorithms. And not for me. He's not making hundreds of billions of dollars
788840	794280	because he's cornered the stock market based on an algorithm designed to first speak originally
794280	799480	designed for speech recognition. It's bullshit. And there's no evidence of that. No one's ever
799480	804920	seen any of these any of this code. No, it's just a bunch of bullshit. Fentucky shit people.
804920	810680	You say to somebody when you don't want to tell the truth, I will stick with this story forever.
810680	815400	It will come out one day. It will come out one day. Okay. People think other people agree with me.
815400	821720	Some people think it's a big Ponzi scheme. The cover story for it. Okay. So let's move on.
821720	827560	You know people being Glenn and Matt Mosk. Good. Yeah. Okay.
831880	841560	Okay. So you agree to leave Roach with some bundle of documents, right? Okay. Selection.
841560	846760	Okay. Mostly for the stuff he personally wanted. I like that Fed letter I gave you.
846760	857480	Yeah. Et cetera. Oh, he dope. And you left him the spreadsheet too, right? That MTO.
857480	864120	No, I don't think I gave him that. Really? I think. I discovered that way later, like six or seven
864120	870520	months later. Well, but it would have been in the files. I gave to Glenn, but I didn't specifically
870520	877560	look at it and give it to him. Okay. If he has it, it must have been, or focused on it,
877560	884040	must have been from Glenn directly. Okay. Okay. So a week or so later, you rent, you rent some
884040	891640	Pathfinder, drive to Philadelphia, get a few grams of China white. Is that right? Yeah. Okay.
891720	899640	And head up to New York. Yeah. To meet John Moskow. Yep. Okay. And it,
902520	911240	so you that one evening go to the offices, that is nice big corner office, and it,
911640	920840	um, what a character he is. What a character he is. What a character that guy is. Yeah.
921640	926600	Yeah. He is a character. Yeah. I mean, so are you. Yeah. Two of you together in a room is
926600	933720	something I would have paid good money to witness. I like to think I'm a good character.
933720	939800	You are. I don't think John Moskow is above the line. Good guy. Okay. So
941560	949000	you're a little high in this meeting. Yeah. No. No more so than usual. No. Okay. And so you go,
949000	955400	you give your whole, uh, spiel that you've practiced many times, you've done many times at
955400	960600	this point. He's impressed. He asked for a look and you kind of do a little multimedia presentation
960600	967800	room with your laptop and your iPad. Okay. Um, Glenn's computer at this point, because my
967800	971960	computer is still in somewhere at this point, this had a crack screen, so we had to go, I had
971960	976680	to plug in this external screen. So I said, that's why I have Glenn's computers. Like, look, man,
976680	981720	I just use this fucking computer. So yeah, fine. Go for it. Okay. So, um,
983720	989960	uh, and Moskow asked if he can have a copy of the files and you at this point balk because
989960	994920	you're being too worried that you're like just handing this out to a new asked and, uh, so you
994920	1000120	offer Moskow a trade. But I also asked Moskow, why are you asking for the files? Glenn sent me
1000120	1004840	up here. He's got the fucking files. Yeah. Why do, why can't you just get them from Glenn? It just,
1004840	1011000	it didn't make sense. Um, well, he wanted them for himself. Yeah. But why couldn't he just say, Glenn,
1011000	1016360	can you send me, we have as much easier to just get them right. Right. Anyway, so you guys offer,
1016360	1021800	you offer trade, which is that they'll help, um, represent you against Deutsche Bank. Yeah.
1021800	1026360	For wrongful death. Yeah, but why go through all this trouble for two days courting me to get
1026360	1032200	the files? If you get it just called Glenn? Yeah. Well, what do you think? I don't know. Okay. I don't
1032200	1038280	know. Um, he, so Moskow tells you he needs to think about that overnight. So you come back the
1038280	1043560	next afternoon and he says, no, they're not going to represent you. And so you guys make a different
1043560	1049720	agreement, which is that he will, or someone at the firm, uh, can provide legal advice to you
1049720	1055560	in your fight with your mom. Yeah. Okay. And I go for three, Avis, Deutsche Bank, and the family
1055560	1059800	estate. Right. But that's not what he ultimately agrees to, right? He agrees to the family estate.
1059800	1063640	Right. He agrees to the family estate. Yeah. He's the next, the other two. Yeah. And the second day.
1064200	1070040	Um, and so you accept that and someone comes in with a new, uh, what's your name called,
1070040	1075000	thumb drive and downloads a bunch of shit. Yeah. Okay. You open it up from the package to make
1075000	1080440	sure it wasn't put some spot where on my computer. It's the whole thing. Yeah. Well, I insisted
1080440	1086200	it on that too. I didn't trust it. Um, I mean, look at this office is filled with CIA fucking papers
1086200	1091800	and shaking hands with CIA directors. Okay. So I don't know if I've told you, I think I have told
1091800	1097560	you this, but they're NSA, you know what Moskow does with that thumb drive, right? Uh, you tell me,
1097560	1103240	I gave it, it gives it to that weird dude on YouTube. Right. Exactly. The New York Fed guy.
1103240	1110360	Um, okay. And this is like one of those places where, I mean, I, this is correlation,
1110360	1114440	not causation, but this is one of those moments where what you did actually might have had some
1114440	1119240	impact because it ends up in the hands of the New York Fed and the hands of this forensic
1119240	1124360	investigator who at that moment is investigating Deutsche Bank and money laundering. And a few
1124440	1132760	months later, um, almost four months later, the Fed does this cease and desist order with Deutsche
1133400	1139400	for Russian money laundering. Um, yeah. Well, it's not specifically for the marriage. It's for
1139400	1144040	Russia. It's for money laundering in general, but yeah, it was the Cyprus. It doesn't go,
1144040	1153160	it doesn't name a single country. Um, okay. Okay. Meanwhile, you and Glenn have a following out.
1153800	1161480	He views you as irresponsible and annoying and spending too much. You view him as owning you
1161480	1165880	a bunch of money and don't think you've done anything wrong. He says you're acting like a vagabond.
1166680	1172600	You say, don't talk to me like you're my father. And he says, well, you need someone to act like
1172600	1181320	your father. Pretty much. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. I don't know why people tend to do these father
1181320	1188120	rules at me. I'm going to be, I'll be your father figure. Again, if this was the Odyssey, Glenn
1188120	1194280	would be the Cyclops. But where are you going? Can we just, we're almost done because I just
1194280	1203560	want to draw this like, tie this in a nice bow. Okay. Like, I think to me it's not coincidental.
1203560	1209240	Actually, John Moscow would be the Cyclops because he's got one eye. He doesn't have one eye. He has
1209240	1214440	two eyes. He's got one bad eye, one glass eye. He does a, is it glass eye? Yeah. I don't know about
1214440	1221400	that. He certainly has whatever it doesn't. He does. Ask him. No, I think I'll pass on asking
1221400	1229080	that. I am like making something of the fact that this is not the first time that someone has
1229720	1233880	kind of stepped into the father figure role. And I think this dialogue you guys have, especially
1233880	1238680	given that you've spent that time on wherever you were out in the countryside together talking about
1238680	1247720	your dads, it's, those words seem, those words from Glenn seem intended to draw some blood.
1247720	1253960	Yeah, I think so. A lot of words from Glenn, true blood, purposely. Like what else?
1257560	1263560	I don't know. It's talking about his father getting on the GI bill after World War II.
1264360	1270600	In other words, Glenn did. Glenn's trying to send me to a journalist school in Berkeley.
1272600	1276520	There's a lot. Wait, why was I trying to draw blood? No, no, not, I'm just going over their
1276520	1282680	conversations. The whole Steele dossier stuff, we talked about that. There was a lot of just like
1282680	1289080	punches about getting to work and bunkering down. And him talking to you like you weren't?
1289080	1295320	Yeah, yeah, just like a standard cliche father son bullshit. And of course, remember, he accuses me
1296200	1299800	of being a Russian spy, but turns out to be his son. So in a sense, there's a
1300600	1306920	subconscious association there too with Glenn and myself and father son again. But anyway,
1307560	1311960	he draws a lot of blood. And if I could show you that I have it all, most of the blood is in the
1311960	1316120	texting. So that's why I'm bringing those up too. I don't think I sent you the last few texts that
1316120	1321160	we had. That's pretty angry. Yeah, no, I think you did. I did. Yeah, I think so. I mean, we're
1321160	1327240	going to take a look at another point. Okay, so there's a bunch of other shit in here that's not
1327240	1334760	of any relevance to you. And but ultimately, for the record, Glenn is a good guy. Like he's a good
1334760	1339000	person. And he's on the right side. Well, you say that about everyone. Well, everyone's inherently
1339000	1344120	pretty good, except for the really bad people. You say that about everyone except for your mom.
1344120	1350120	And and and you say that in an apologetic way about people who have like really mistreated you
1350120	1356600	and burned you. I don't understand it. Yeah. Seriously, Samantha Sheldon has not treated you
1356600	1366840	well. You know, you're right. Glenn, like by your telling has like, you know, withheld money from
1366840	1371400	you and just burned you, it is slandering you. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You said the
1371400	1380200	same thing. You're right. I do that a lot. Why? I don't know. I don't want to live in anger and hate
1380200	1385320	people at times. Everyone's got their quirks. It's forgivable. It's something you didn't do
1385320	1393880	anything that's unforgivable. I don't think the handler did either. You know, it's ups and it's
1393880	1400360	good and bad for everything. It's mostly gray area. Not everyone is 100% good 100% bad. It's
1400440	1406600	a gray area with your mom. Not right now. I'm still really mad at her. Yeah, but I'm sure there is
1406600	1414440	if I wasn't so angry, blinded by anger. But yeah, I'm sure. Okay. We're at 7 o'clock. Do you want
1414440	1421080	to take a break or do you want to go? Yeah, I'll see you right here. Good afternoon.
