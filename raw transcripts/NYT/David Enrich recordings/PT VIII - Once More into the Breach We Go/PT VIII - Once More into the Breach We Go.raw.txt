[00:00.000 --> 00:05.820]  Okay, okay. He calls you and asks what you've got in Trump. You say you really
[00:05.820 --> 00:10.920]  don't know. Right. He agrees to pay ten grand, half upfront, half on delivery for
[00:10.920 --> 00:15.840]  everything. Pretty quick conversation. Glenn doesn't want to be on an unsecured
[00:15.840 --> 00:22.000]  phone line. No, he's very paranoid. Yeah, and wants to switch to signal. Yeah. And so
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.000]  I've seen those signal messages. He says let's get you here ASAP, please come.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.360]  There's some discussion about where your grenades should go. You settle on
[00:29.360 --> 00:35.120]  St. Thomas. 5,000 bucks arrives in your PayPal account. He gives you an amix
[00:35.120 --> 00:41.600]  number to book plane tickets. You go to St. Thomas. The 5,000 arrives in St. Thomas.
[00:41.600 --> 00:45.360]  So first he just gives me the car car number. Well, he offers. No, I don't think
[00:45.360 --> 00:49.600]  that's right. Yeah, yeah, he offers to send. We'll check that. Okay. There's because
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.560]  I've looked at these times and you've showed me the PayPal receipt or the
[00:54.560 --> 00:57.880]  anyway, we'll come back to that. But that's some pretty sure that was in St. Thomas
[00:57.920 --> 01:02.080]  after he and his tech guy looked over the files. Then he said, okay, then they
[01:02.080 --> 01:08.800]  sent the 5,000. And it doesn't matter. There's you got the 5,000. Before you
[01:08.800 --> 01:13.920]  get to St. Thomas, Glenn asked for some research on specific topics. He says any
[01:13.920 --> 01:24.880]  Russian stuff at all. He is looking for stuff on Rentec and Mercer. And then he
[01:24.880 --> 01:28.880]  said you say you appreciate you've got that stuff. And but it's gonna take a
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.680]  lot of digging to find it. He says be safe and I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, you're
[01:33.680 --> 01:39.040]  feeling pretty proud and excited. This is like higher level clandestine work than
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.480]  you've been previously doing. Glenn is a celebrity a little bit. Yeah. Okay, I
[01:44.480 --> 01:53.280]  call Peggy too. Okay. So it's a good Peggy come back in the story here. Okay. And
[01:53.280 --> 01:59.160]  if you want to make a note for Peggy's, but chronologically, yes. Okay, St. Thomas.
[01:59.160 --> 02:07.920]  Glenn comes with a computer dude. Yeah. You alternate between going through all
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.240]  the stuff in the hotel suite. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. You all were in a suite
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.760]  together, right? No. I had my own and they had one in a different building down
[02:16.760 --> 02:20.120]  the hall. But in the same hotel? In the same hotel. Okay. And whose hotel suite were you
[02:20.120 --> 02:25.680]  working in? Mine. Okay. And it so you alternate between that and you spend a
[02:25.680 --> 02:29.120]  bunch of time out at a picnic table on the beach, drinking beers, smoking cigarettes.
[02:29.120 --> 02:40.160]  Yeah, and it took me to Strip Club. Okay. Yeah, dirty weird Strip Club. Okay, you've
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.800]  described Glenn as manic. Unable to sit still, chattering constantly about Trump
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.400]  and about fusions, financial struggles. He said he told you. He told me everything
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.480]  wasn't just that. Well, but you got into. Slightly manic. I wouldn't say over it
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.440]  because manic is a strong word too. Okay, I'll say slightly manic. Yeah. Slightly.
[03:00.440 --> 03:11.240]  Paranoid. Quite paranoid. Okay. So he told you that any kind of dirt you could turn
[03:11.240 --> 03:17.560]  up on Mercer, or Rentec, or Trump, or Deutsche could be valuable to him, to his
[03:17.560 --> 03:25.560]  current or prospective future clients. Yeah. Okay. And he at one point. He sold me
[03:25.560 --> 03:29.440]  because he knew I did not like Trump. He saw my tweets. And so he knew I was
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.320]  anti Trump. So he said it's it would be helpful for him to learn about how the
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.080]  funding Mercer funded the Trump campaign and any connection the Deutsche Bank had
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.120]  the Trump and the connection between Mercer and Deutsche Bank. And Rentec was
[03:43.120 --> 03:47.200]  its own entity. If anything on Rentec, fine, but it was mostly Mercer was a
[03:47.200 --> 03:54.240]  focus. Mostly Mercer. Yeah, Rentec is secondary. Well, Mercer is Rentec. I know.
[03:54.240 --> 04:01.040]  Well, not really. Mercer had, on his own, whatever his foundation is, gave that
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.400]  money to Trump. Rentec did not give the money to Trump. Yeah. So in that sense.
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.640]  Okay, so you're going through all this stuff. You don't actually find a whole
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.440]  lot in Bill T. Millall concerts. No, as you knew already, there are no mentions of
[04:14.440 --> 04:18.320]  Trump. No. There is a lot of Rentec stuff. Yeah, there's a lot. Well, that's a
[04:18.320 --> 04:21.840]  competitive. The name Mercer hardly comes up at all. There's lots of
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.000]  Rentec stuff. But most of that, it doesn't really shed new light beyond. He's a
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.280]  Senate Bob Roach and his crew have already turned up so much. So you spend a
[04:31.280 --> 04:36.800]  few days there and then Glenn invites you to come back to Washington with him.
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.200]  Yeah. And you agree? Yeah. And you fly separately to avoid a
[04:41.200 --> 04:47.880]  razmine suspicion. At Dulles, you get a text. I don't know if that's true, but it
[04:47.920 --> 04:53.280]  could be. What? Fly separately to not a razmine suspicion. The only reason I
[04:53.280 --> 04:56.200]  have that in here is because you told me. Really? So if you don't, if you're not
[04:56.200 --> 04:59.560]  sure about that, I shouldn't have. I'm not sure, but sounds good. That's fine. No, no, no,
[04:59.560 --> 05:03.720]  that's, they, because Glenn said he had to go back for something first. So he only
[05:03.720 --> 05:07.520]  stayed a few days and then went back to hold still, hold tight here while we
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.880]  figure out what to do next. Okay. You get to Dulles, he sends you a text with an
[05:12.880 --> 05:15.960]  address for you to come to. But keep in mind, there's a lot going on in this
[05:16.040 --> 05:20.920]  hotel. There's this convention. Yeah. But it's not really that interesting on the
[05:20.920 --> 05:24.960]  grand scheme of things because it's just like a, it's a National Guard meeting. I
[05:24.960 --> 05:28.800]  think there was National Security Services. No, it's National Guard. I've looked at
[05:28.800 --> 05:32.320]  your picture of the. There was a lot. There was, well, it was one ballroom. There
[05:32.320 --> 05:36.800]  was every single ballroom had different government agency attached to it. There's
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.400]  all government people. Certainly all the different government agencies listed on
[05:41.400 --> 05:45.800]  that thing. On that specific one. But there was, again, that's a huge
[05:45.880 --> 05:47.840]  hotel with a lot of these rooms.
[05:50.720 --> 05:54.920]  Just to be sure you can find some research, find out what was going on in
[05:54.920 --> 05:58.440]  that hotel. I'm sure there's evidence online.
[06:00.200 --> 06:06.040]  Okay. So you get to Glenn's house, brings you to a guest room. Next morning, you
[06:06.040 --> 06:11.120]  get this great up close view of his paranoia. You're on the front porch
[06:11.160 --> 06:17.720]  smoking a Marlboro. He comes out notices a small rip in one of the window
[06:17.720 --> 06:21.000]  screens and says, why are you messing with my window? Did you sneak out last
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.200]  night? Right. You say no. Well, no, it was more like, you know, what did you, did
[06:26.200 --> 06:29.600]  you meet somebody last night? Did you come out of the house? Because sneaking
[06:29.600 --> 06:33.640]  out is like, you know, I'm just kidding. But it's more like, did you, did you
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.000]  have a rendezvous with someone? There was a car I saw coming around the car in
[06:38.000 --> 06:44.160]  the house. I heard some noises. I heard the car speed off. I heard the door
[06:44.160 --> 06:49.280]  closed and open. Did you meet somebody? Did you in the middle of the night? No,
[06:49.280 --> 06:53.640]  of course not. Okay. And he said, he kind of eyes you suspiciously and says,
[06:53.640 --> 06:57.440]  let's see what the video shows. Yeah, he points to the camera, which I knew was
[06:57.440 --> 07:02.920]  there. And there was a terror in the, in the screen, in front of the screen. Okay.
[07:02.920 --> 07:08.160]  So he brings you into his office and there shows you the, the video feed. I
[07:08.160 --> 07:11.280]  wrote you this whole story. Yeah, no, I'm just, I'm just making sure we got this
[07:11.280 --> 07:17.400]  right. So he in the video shows his son trying to pry the screen off the window
[07:17.400 --> 07:23.080]  to get it drunk in late. Um, and so he kind of Glenn kind of relaxes a little
[07:23.080 --> 07:28.440]  bit at that point. He doesn't view you for Glenn. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you never
[07:28.440 --> 07:33.000]  apologize. Yeah, I've got that. So a couple of nights, you spend a couple nights
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.120]  there. Yeah. Then you go up to his secluded house in the countryside down
[07:39.120 --> 07:43.920]  a long dirt lane with a force in one side and a river on the other. Yeah. A few
[07:43.920 --> 07:48.760]  boats moored at the Flood and Dock. Yeah. You spend a long time repairing wooden
[07:48.760 --> 07:53.400]  fence. Yeah. Trumpets through the mud. Yeah. Writing ATVs in the wood. Yeah.
[07:53.680 --> 08:01.320]  Drinking a lot. Yeah. Beer and liquor. Beer and liquor. He has a case of beer and he had a bunch of booze and
[08:01.320 --> 08:05.600]  that kind of thing. Yeah. You talked about Trump. Yeah. You talked about Christopher
[08:05.600 --> 08:12.280]  Steele. Yeah. You talked about your father's. Yeah. Okay. You told Glenn about
[08:12.280 --> 08:20.920]  your story and he told you about his story. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. Glenn's
[08:20.960 --> 08:33.360]  hired a retired Deutsche Auditor. Okay. And here I go into stuff about that spreadsheet,
[08:33.360 --> 08:50.680]  which is how we started all these videos. Right. Okay. So there's, this is when Glenn,
[08:50.760 --> 08:58.680]  so you go back to Washington and Glenn starts sending you out to meet people. So first up is
[08:58.680 --> 09:09.920]  Bob Roach. Right. And let's see. Glenn tells Roach, I'd really like you to look at this.
[09:10.480 --> 09:14.400]  And Roach is happy to do so. It seems like an interesting opportunity. So one afternoon,
[09:14.400 --> 09:19.600]  you show up at the Dirksen building. You, by the way, this might have been Stan,
[09:19.600 --> 09:25.640]  the Beacon Hotel. Yeah. Okay. Charging room service. No room service. No room service.
[09:25.640 --> 09:31.240]  Yeah. Glenn made it clear. Don't use room service on my card. So I said, okay, I will not use room
[09:31.240 --> 09:39.600]  service on your card. Okay. Um, I never did. Sure about that. Is that the only reason I have that
[09:39.600 --> 09:45.400]  in here is because I told you specifically, Glenn said to me, do not use room service on this card.
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.640]  You can, this is for the room only. You pay for the food and stuff and just don't use the room
[09:50.640 --> 09:54.400]  service because I don't want to get out of hand. I said, okay. I never use room service on that
[09:54.400 --> 10:00.160]  card. Um, so how are we paying for food and stuff while you're there? Oh, he gave me five
[10:00.160 --> 10:05.720]  grand. Okay. And then the other money came in too. With what other money? The BG money. Okay.
[10:05.720 --> 10:17.240]  Okay. So you go to Roach's office and he's got this bundle of printouts for you with a bunch of
[10:17.240 --> 10:25.320]  news articles and other stuff. And he tells you that he's looking for a Trump connection to Russia
[10:25.320 --> 10:33.840]  by way of Deutsche Bank. Bob Roach? Yes. And he says he's also very interested in anything I have
[10:34.160 --> 10:44.520]  especially in the stress test stuff as well. And he said he was putting together a, I don't know if
[10:44.520 --> 10:47.840]  it was a book because he had a bunch of books he'd written or showed me. I know, so those are
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.160]  sending oversight hearings he had done. It's like 16-0. He was together some kind of project where
[10:53.160 --> 10:59.360]  he was looking at all the times regulators were asking Deutsche Bank to do something and they
[10:59.360 --> 11:05.400]  either never responded or bullshit responded or responded to do something and never followed up
[11:05.400 --> 11:12.680]  on it. So if I had any instances of that, it would be very helpful for him personally. Okay.
[11:12.680 --> 11:20.240]  Then we talked about Mercer. He told me about meeting Mercer. And the discussion was how does
[11:20.240 --> 11:27.480]  he make this money? And the medallion fund versus the public fund is incredibly disproportionate
[11:27.640 --> 11:40.200]  of the profits. It's ridiculous. 23 billion split between 100 and three people. So we figured,
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.320]  I think this actually meant Matt Mosk for us now because that's why I brought up the Ponzi scheme
[11:45.320 --> 11:50.080]  idea. But he said he sat down and spoke with Mercer and Mercer explained to him that he had
[11:50.840 --> 11:58.960]  adapted an algorithm for speech recognition for the stock markets. And Bob Roach is so confident,
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.920]  like that's clearly what it is. And I'm hearing it's like, this is what you tell an idiot when
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.000]  you want to just say something fintechy and then everyone that doesn't understand anything about
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.280]  algorithms or computers, oh yes, of course, that must be it. And I couldn't believe that Bob Roach
[12:14.440 --> 12:19.480]  bought this slide. I was like, Bob, like, come on, think about it. If this had happened, I mean,
[12:19.480 --> 12:22.920]  maybe in the 90s, when people, the markets would have been cornered by millions of people. He's
[12:22.920 --> 12:27.400]  not the only person in the world. I mean, these ideas just think it's not one person that has this
[12:27.400 --> 12:32.760]  idea that they're naturally come up together, like a paradigm shift or zeitgeist ideas happen
[12:32.760 --> 12:36.040]  like this. You know, it's not just he's been holding onto this since the 90s. It's bullshit.
[12:36.040 --> 12:41.560]  No one can corner a market because of a fucking algorithm that they wrote. It's like the Bad
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.800]  James Bond film. He's like, no, I really believe he's he was a military intelligence. I don't
[12:45.800 --> 12:50.280]  care if he's a military intelligence. It's bullshit. It can't it's not happening. It's not what the
[12:50.280 --> 12:56.200]  real story is. We had it. I don't want you to come to their entire business. Ransom's entire business
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.200]  is designing very sophisticated trading strategies based on finding little inefficiencies in the
[13:02.200 --> 13:08.840]  market based on algorithms. And not for me. He's not making hundreds of billions of dollars
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.280]  because he's cornered the stock market based on an algorithm designed to first speak originally
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.480]  designed for speech recognition. It's bullshit. And there's no evidence of that. No one's ever
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.920]  seen any of these any of this code. No, it's just a bunch of bullshit. Fentucky shit people.
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.680]  You say to somebody when you don't want to tell the truth, I will stick with this story forever.
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.400]  It will come out one day. It will come out one day. Okay. People think other people agree with me.
[13:35.400 --> 13:41.720]  Some people think it's a big Ponzi scheme. The cover story for it. Okay. So let's move on.
[13:41.720 --> 13:47.560]  You know people being Glenn and Matt Mosk. Good. Yeah. Okay.
[13:51.880 --> 14:01.560]  Okay. So you agree to leave Roach with some bundle of documents, right? Okay. Selection.
[14:01.560 --> 14:06.760]  Okay. Mostly for the stuff he personally wanted. I like that Fed letter I gave you.
[14:06.760 --> 14:17.480]  Yeah. Et cetera. Oh, he dope. And you left him the spreadsheet too, right? That MTO.
[14:17.480 --> 14:24.120]  No, I don't think I gave him that. Really? I think. I discovered that way later, like six or seven
[14:24.120 --> 14:30.520]  months later. Well, but it would have been in the files. I gave to Glenn, but I didn't specifically
[14:30.520 --> 14:37.560]  look at it and give it to him. Okay. If he has it, it must have been, or focused on it,
[14:37.560 --> 14:44.040]  must have been from Glenn directly. Okay. Okay. So a week or so later, you rent, you rent some
[14:44.040 --> 14:51.640]  Pathfinder, drive to Philadelphia, get a few grams of China white. Is that right? Yeah. Okay.
[14:51.720 --> 14:59.640]  And head up to New York. Yeah. To meet John Moskow. Yep. Okay. And it,
[15:02.520 --> 15:11.240]  so you that one evening go to the offices, that is nice big corner office, and it,
[15:11.640 --> 15:20.840]  um, what a character he is. What a character he is. What a character that guy is. Yeah.
[15:21.640 --> 15:26.600]  Yeah. He is a character. Yeah. I mean, so are you. Yeah. Two of you together in a room is
[15:26.600 --> 15:33.720]  something I would have paid good money to witness. I like to think I'm a good character.
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.800]  You are. I don't think John Moskow is above the line. Good guy. Okay. So
[15:41.560 --> 15:49.000]  you're a little high in this meeting. Yeah. No. No more so than usual. No. Okay. And so you go,
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.400]  you give your whole, uh, spiel that you've practiced many times, you've done many times at
[15:55.400 --> 16:00.600]  this point. He's impressed. He asked for a look and you kind of do a little multimedia presentation
[16:00.600 --> 16:07.800]  room with your laptop and your iPad. Okay. Um, Glenn's computer at this point, because my
[16:07.800 --> 16:11.960]  computer is still in somewhere at this point, this had a crack screen, so we had to go, I had
[16:11.960 --> 16:16.680]  to plug in this external screen. So I said, that's why I have Glenn's computers. Like, look, man,
[16:16.680 --> 16:21.720]  I just use this fucking computer. So yeah, fine. Go for it. Okay. So, um,
[16:23.720 --> 16:29.960]  uh, and Moskow asked if he can have a copy of the files and you at this point balk because
[16:29.960 --> 16:34.920]  you're being too worried that you're like just handing this out to a new asked and, uh, so you
[16:34.920 --> 16:40.120]  offer Moskow a trade. But I also asked Moskow, why are you asking for the files? Glenn sent me
[16:40.120 --> 16:44.840]  up here. He's got the fucking files. Yeah. Why do, why can't you just get them from Glenn? It just,
[16:44.840 --> 16:51.000]  it didn't make sense. Um, well, he wanted them for himself. Yeah. But why couldn't he just say, Glenn,
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.360]  can you send me, we have as much easier to just get them right. Right. Anyway, so you guys offer,
[16:56.360 --> 17:01.800]  you offer trade, which is that they'll help, um, represent you against Deutsche Bank. Yeah.
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.360]  For wrongful death. Yeah, but why go through all this trouble for two days courting me to get
[17:06.360 --> 17:12.200]  the files? If you get it just called Glenn? Yeah. Well, what do you think? I don't know. Okay. I don't
[17:12.200 --> 17:18.280]  know. Um, he, so Moskow tells you he needs to think about that overnight. So you come back the
[17:18.280 --> 17:23.560]  next afternoon and he says, no, they're not going to represent you. And so you guys make a different
[17:23.560 --> 17:29.720]  agreement, which is that he will, or someone at the firm, uh, can provide legal advice to you
[17:29.720 --> 17:35.560]  in your fight with your mom. Yeah. Okay. And I go for three, Avis, Deutsche Bank, and the family
[17:35.560 --> 17:39.800]  estate. Right. But that's not what he ultimately agrees to, right? He agrees to the family estate.
[17:39.800 --> 17:43.640]  Right. He agrees to the family estate. Yeah. He's the next, the other two. Yeah. And the second day.
[17:44.200 --> 17:50.040]  Um, and so you accept that and someone comes in with a new, uh, what's your name called,
[17:50.040 --> 17:55.000]  thumb drive and downloads a bunch of shit. Yeah. Okay. You open it up from the package to make
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.440]  sure it wasn't put some spot where on my computer. It's the whole thing. Yeah. Well, I insisted
[18:00.440 --> 18:06.200]  it on that too. I didn't trust it. Um, I mean, look at this office is filled with CIA fucking papers
[18:06.200 --> 18:11.800]  and shaking hands with CIA directors. Okay. So I don't know if I've told you, I think I have told
[18:11.800 --> 18:17.560]  you this, but they're NSA, you know what Moskow does with that thumb drive, right? Uh, you tell me,
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.240]  I gave it, it gives it to that weird dude on YouTube. Right. Exactly. The New York Fed guy.
[18:23.240 --> 18:30.360]  Um, okay. And this is like one of those places where, I mean, I, this is correlation,
[18:30.360 --> 18:34.440]  not causation, but this is one of those moments where what you did actually might have had some
[18:34.440 --> 18:39.240]  impact because it ends up in the hands of the New York Fed and the hands of this forensic
[18:39.240 --> 18:44.360]  investigator who at that moment is investigating Deutsche Bank and money laundering. And a few
[18:44.440 --> 18:52.760]  months later, um, almost four months later, the Fed does this cease and desist order with Deutsche
[18:53.400 --> 18:59.400]  for Russian money laundering. Um, yeah. Well, it's not specifically for the marriage. It's for
[18:59.400 --> 19:04.040]  Russia. It's for money laundering in general, but yeah, it was the Cyprus. It doesn't go,
[19:04.040 --> 19:13.160]  it doesn't name a single country. Um, okay. Okay. Meanwhile, you and Glenn have a following out.
[19:13.800 --> 19:21.480]  He views you as irresponsible and annoying and spending too much. You view him as owning you
[19:21.480 --> 19:25.880]  a bunch of money and don't think you've done anything wrong. He says you're acting like a vagabond.
[19:26.680 --> 19:32.600]  You say, don't talk to me like you're my father. And he says, well, you need someone to act like
[19:32.600 --> 19:41.320]  your father. Pretty much. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. I don't know why people tend to do these father
[19:41.320 --> 19:48.120]  rules at me. I'm going to be, I'll be your father figure. Again, if this was the Odyssey, Glenn
[19:48.120 --> 19:54.280]  would be the Cyclops. But where are you going? Can we just, we're almost done because I just
[19:54.280 --> 20:03.560]  want to draw this like, tie this in a nice bow. Okay. Like, I think to me it's not coincidental.
[20:03.560 --> 20:09.240]  Actually, John Moscow would be the Cyclops because he's got one eye. He doesn't have one eye. He has
[20:09.240 --> 20:14.440]  two eyes. He's got one bad eye, one glass eye. He does a, is it glass eye? Yeah. I don't know about
[20:14.440 --> 20:21.400]  that. He certainly has whatever it doesn't. He does. Ask him. No, I think I'll pass on asking
[20:21.400 --> 20:29.080]  that. I am like making something of the fact that this is not the first time that someone has
[20:29.720 --> 20:33.880]  kind of stepped into the father figure role. And I think this dialogue you guys have, especially
[20:33.880 --> 20:38.680]  given that you've spent that time on wherever you were out in the countryside together talking about
[20:38.680 --> 20:47.720]  your dads, it's, those words seem, those words from Glenn seem intended to draw some blood.
[20:47.720 --> 20:53.960]  Yeah, I think so. A lot of words from Glenn, true blood, purposely. Like what else?
[20:57.560 --> 21:03.560]  I don't know. It's talking about his father getting on the GI bill after World War II.
[21:04.360 --> 21:10.600]  In other words, Glenn did. Glenn's trying to send me to a journalist school in Berkeley.
[21:12.600 --> 21:16.520]  There's a lot. Wait, why was I trying to draw blood? No, no, not, I'm just going over their
[21:16.520 --> 21:22.680]  conversations. The whole Steele dossier stuff, we talked about that. There was a lot of just like
[21:22.680 --> 21:29.080]  punches about getting to work and bunkering down. And him talking to you like you weren't?
[21:29.080 --> 21:35.320]  Yeah, yeah, just like a standard cliche father son bullshit. And of course, remember, he accuses me
[21:36.200 --> 21:39.800]  of being a Russian spy, but turns out to be his son. So in a sense, there's a
[21:40.600 --> 21:46.920]  subconscious association there too with Glenn and myself and father son again. But anyway,
[21:47.560 --> 21:51.960]  he draws a lot of blood. And if I could show you that I have it all, most of the blood is in the
[21:51.960 --> 21:56.120]  texting. So that's why I'm bringing those up too. I don't think I sent you the last few texts that
[21:56.120 --> 22:01.160]  we had. That's pretty angry. Yeah, no, I think you did. I did. Yeah, I think so. I mean, we're
[22:01.160 --> 22:07.240]  going to take a look at another point. Okay, so there's a bunch of other shit in here that's not
[22:07.240 --> 22:14.760]  of any relevance to you. And but ultimately, for the record, Glenn is a good guy. Like he's a good
[22:14.760 --> 22:19.000]  person. And he's on the right side. Well, you say that about everyone. Well, everyone's inherently
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.120]  pretty good, except for the really bad people. You say that about everyone except for your mom.
[22:24.120 --> 22:30.120]  And and and you say that in an apologetic way about people who have like really mistreated you
[22:30.120 --> 22:36.600]  and burned you. I don't understand it. Yeah. Seriously, Samantha Sheldon has not treated you
[22:36.600 --> 22:46.840]  well. You know, you're right. Glenn, like by your telling has like, you know, withheld money from
[22:46.840 --> 22:51.400]  you and just burned you, it is slandering you. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You said the
[22:51.400 --> 23:00.200]  same thing. You're right. I do that a lot. Why? I don't know. I don't want to live in anger and hate
[23:00.200 --> 23:05.320]  people at times. Everyone's got their quirks. It's forgivable. It's something you didn't do
[23:05.320 --> 23:13.880]  anything that's unforgivable. I don't think the handler did either. You know, it's ups and it's
[23:13.880 --> 23:20.360]  good and bad for everything. It's mostly gray area. Not everyone is 100% good 100% bad. It's
[23:20.440 --> 23:26.600]  a gray area with your mom. Not right now. I'm still really mad at her. Yeah, but I'm sure there is
[23:26.600 --> 23:34.440]  if I wasn't so angry, blinded by anger. But yeah, I'm sure. Okay. We're at 7 o'clock. Do you want
[23:34.440 --> 23:41.080]  to take a break or do you want to go? Yeah, I'll see you right here. Good afternoon.
