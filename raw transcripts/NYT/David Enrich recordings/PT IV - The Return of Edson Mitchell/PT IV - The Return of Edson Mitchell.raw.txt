[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  I mean these aren't going to be synced up at all, like this is going to be a mess from right?
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  No, I mean it'll be easy.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  It'll be so easy for them to sync it up.
[00:08.000 --> 00:09.000]  Um...
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  It's not difficult.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  Okay.
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  Um...
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  Okay.
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  Let's see.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.000]  Alright, so...
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  1145.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  Yeah.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  He gets up, gets himself out of bed.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  Okay.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  Pulls on jeans, buttoned down shirt.
[00:27.000 --> 00:29.000]  Rain is falling.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  Water dripping down the windows.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  Warping his view of the world outside.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  So it was raining, I was right.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  Yeah.
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.000]  Um...
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  I remember seeing rain in Chelsea.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.000]  It was raining.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.000]  Yeah.
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  Uh...
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  Bill's latest Sunday routine of going to the cafe for coffee, newspapers, people watching.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Bill says no thanks.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  All leaves.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  Not super happy with Bill.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  That he's flaking out.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  Um...
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  It's 1145.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  Door to the building clicks, the last clocks.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  Bill gets the letters from the hiding place.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  Put some in Daisy's bed.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  Wait, he gets the letters from the hiding place?
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  They were written in advance.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  They were written in advance?
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  Yeah.
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  How far in advance?
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.000]  I don't know.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  How do you know this?
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  Because I've looked at the letters and I've looked at a clock.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  And there's no...
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  It is physically impossible for him to have written those letters
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  and done what he's about to do in the time allowed.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Have you tried it?
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  I've eyeballed it.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  There is...
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  He wrote seven letters.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  Okay.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Including one that was at least ten pages long.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  Right.
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  Okay.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  There's no way he did that in...
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  And there were drops.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.000]  In 45 minutes.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  But I saw drops thrown away in the trash bin.
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.000]  Um...
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  Maybe he did half and half.
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.000]  Maybe he wrote some before.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  What do you think, the night before?
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  I have no idea.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  Okay.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  There were...
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  Takes Daisy's red leash.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  Okay.
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  Attaches one end to the handle on the front shores.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  Arcs the leash over the top of the doors.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  Ties the other around his neck.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  Make sure it's secure.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  Lunges forward.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  Okay.
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  40 minutes after the shoe lap.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  All it comes back.
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  Climbed stairs.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  Walks into the apartment.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Bill's hanging.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  She calls 999.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  Dispatcher says help is on its way.
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  Goes into the kitchen.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  Grabs a knife.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  And a small ladder.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  Climbs up the ladder.
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.000]  Slices the leash.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  Bill crashes to the floor.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  All the world's his body.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  She tries CPR.
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.000]  Doesn't work.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  Paramedics arrive at 1231.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Which is three minutes after the radio calling out.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  All they find are all a crouched over bill.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  Trying CPR.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  But screaming too much for it to be effective.
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.000]  They take over.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  And the EMT removes the leash from Bill's neck.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  Checks for breathing and pulse.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.000]  Doesn't find either.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  Clamps on a neck brace.
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  Inserts a tube into Bill's throat to open his obstructive airway.
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  Starts pumping in oxygen.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  Another paramedic hooks up an IV with adrenaline.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  Someone radius for a helicopter ambulance.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  It's too late.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  One o'clock.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  He's pronounced life extent.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  All of us manages to say that he'd been depressed
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  and was taking hard medication.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  Paramex being packed in their equipment.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  You arrive 10 minutes later.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  Paramex tells you that police are on their way.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  You're in a haze.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  You don't really understand why.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  Figure you should document the scene.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  He snaps some photos.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  Bill's like draped in a white bathrobe.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  And his head and neck and arms are all sticking out perpendicular to his body.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  Looking a little bit like you've been crucified.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  What?
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  You know?
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  I've seen the pictures.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  Crucified?
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  White bathrobe.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  There's a white bit.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  Oh, over on top of him.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  His head and neck and arms are sticking out.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  Right.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  Yes, they opened up...
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  Yes, food.
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.000]  I can't remember why.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  But yeah, his arms are out.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  Okay.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  Crucified.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  Okay.
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  Coffee table has the DBTCA paperwork that had come in the DHL package a few days earlier.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  Top of the pile is a letter before I didn't brief over you.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  You thumb through the papers.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  DBTCA, the acronym DBTCA keeps popping up.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  You have no idea what that stands for.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  Someone finds the letters in Daisy's bed.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  Alla, Alessa, Kushka, you, Mom, Anchu, Michael Miranda.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  You open yours, single piece of printer paper.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  Read the letter.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  Stuff back in the envelope.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  Nothing really sunk in.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  Alla tells you to call someone for help.
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.000]  It was you, Faisola's number.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  You're under the impression that it's a family lawyer, not one of Bill's Deutsche colleagues.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  I know.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.000]  I say, we need some help.
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  I say, we need to call someone.
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.000]  Do we have a lawyer?
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.000]  Okay.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  So I don't want to say that.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.000]  Okay, that's good.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  And she says, why would we be talking?
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  We need a lawyer.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  The police are coming.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.000]  The police are coming.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  Who's our lawyer?
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  Do we have a family lawyer?
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  It's like, call McKaley.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  Call McKaley.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  Okay.
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  Good.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  That's good.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  I say, who's McKaley?
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  And I think it was either her phone or my dad's phone.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  Search through.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  I give it to my mom.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  She searched through it between click-solving and stuff.
[05:44.000 --> 05:45.000]  She stops crying for a minute.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  She finds the phone number, hands it to me, and then I call.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  I don't remember if I called from the phone or I call it from my phone.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  I don't remember.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  I just remember calling.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  And then she starts crying again when the phone left her hand.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  Okay.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.000]  Let me kind of interrupt real fast.
[06:00.000 --> 06:01.000]  Do we have any more light?
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  We could have a pyramid in chance.
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  I feel like this is getting a little...
[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  Maybe if we just...
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  You know what I mean?
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  Yeah.
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  How does it look?
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.000]  It's dark.
[06:14.000 --> 06:15.000]  Excuse me.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  I think we should...
[06:17.000 --> 06:19.000]  Do you have those lamps that you could put over?
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.000]  Yeah.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.000]  Here.
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  Let me just pause this for a sec.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.000]  Okay.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  Is there a pause in my phone too?
[06:25.000 --> 06:26.000]  Yep.
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.000]  We'll do it.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  This lets me...
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  Okay.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  Okay.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  So you call Faisola.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  You say, this is Val, William's son.
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  We need your help.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  My dad is dead.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  And he rushes over and is there very quickly.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.000]  Yeah.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  Police arrive.
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.000]  Your mom is curled on the floor, stroking Bill's head and brushing hair out of his closed eyes and crying.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  And you put your arm around her.
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  I'm brushing hair out of his closed eyes because his eyes kept opening.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  I remember she kept closing them.
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Okay.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  That's good.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  You put your arm around her and her crying kind of quiet.
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  So it occurred to you at that moment that that was the first time you had really touched her.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  Not just in passing, since you were a child.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  And you said to yourself, well, this is a little weird.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  Got kind of self-conscious and removed your arm and walked away and her crying.
[07:25.000 --> 07:26.000]  And she felt the same.
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  You could tell she stopped crying too.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  Maybe it was just comforting.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  No, I don't think so.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  It was just awkward for both of us.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  Cops come and inspect the suicide notes and they ask you to verify the handwriting.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  And you said, you can't look at them.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  The cop told them you have to.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  And you looked again and burst into tears.
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  And then the officer hands you another note.
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  And you turn away.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  I'm not going to do it.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  He says, just push on.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  You don't have to read every sentence.
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  And so you peeked at each note and confirmed your father had written them,
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.000]  but didn't actually really look at the words.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  Beth, meanwhile, had been in Wales that weekend for her mom's birthday.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  It was on a bus back to London.
[08:14.000 --> 08:21.000]  And it was like just kind of like angry at you because you hadn't been responding to our text messages.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  And she was like, what is wrong with my unreliable boyfriend?
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  And finally, we've had it.
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  Yeah, I forgot.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  Yeah.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  This has been a point of some memory problems.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  I'm inclined to trust her recollection over years.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  I didn't party the night before.
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  No, you had originally said that you and Beth were together the night before.
[08:45.000 --> 08:46.000]  I thought so.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  And then you reconciled this once Beth told me this,
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  that you had been with your bandmates and your friends like partying the night before or at a club or something.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  Something like that.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  Or maybe just recording at night.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  I don't remember anymore.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  Well, it doesn't matter, but I'm fairly confident that what I've gotten, we've worked on it a lot.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  So finally, you replied to one of her texts and say, my dad is dead.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  And her immediate assumption is that it's Alexander who's dead and you'd somehow just gotten worse.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  It didn't occur to her that Bill was dead.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  And she called you and heard that no, it was Bill who's dead.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  Alexander, I don't think I could talk about him with her.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  Maybe once or twice.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  Her point is that it didn't make any sense that your dad was dead.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  Right.
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  What were you talking about?
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  She'd just been with your dad at that gospel choir in the restaurant.
[09:46.000 --> 09:56.000]  So she gets back to London and gets an overnight bag, comes over to Evelyn Gardens.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  You meet her outside.
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.000]  And the police are gone.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  The coroner's removed the body.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  And it's just like sad and miserable.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  And Faisola's over there and his wife Maria.
[10:08.000 --> 10:15.000]  And at that point, Faisola says, you guys go into your dad's office, like apartment, right?
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.000]  He's just two apartments.
[10:16.000 --> 10:17.000]  Yeah, across the hall.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  And it says, Faisola says to you, is this your dad's computer?
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  Can I check some things?
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  You were in no shape to say no.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  And you watch over his shoulder as he rummaged around on the computer.
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  And I'm noting.
[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  But not again out of any sort of disdain or any sort of concern.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  I just was like, oh, what's he looking for?
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  Maybe I can help or maybe...
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  So what I'm saying here is that...
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  Maybe there's a sensible one here that's looking for clues.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  Let's focus on this.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  So what I'm saying here is that this is your recollection.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  And that you told me about this shortly after it happened.
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  But that Faisola just says it's completely not true.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  I mean, I have no way around that.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  You've been telling me that all along.
[11:01.000 --> 11:09.000]  And so your mind is churning.
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.000]  We're trying to figure out what the fuck just happened, basically.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  You remember watching at that point a TV prison drama with your dad.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  Where an inmate hung himself in a door handle.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  And you and your dad had exchanged puzzled glances
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  and discussed the physics of whether that was actually possible.
[11:26.000 --> 11:27.000]  And decided that yes it was.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  It probably wasn't even that hard.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  And so that night, you and Beth go to sleep in the office.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  Or in the other apartment here.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  In the other apartment.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  And you spend a couple of minutes going through your dad's computer at that point.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  And the email accounts are logged in.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  And you figured maybe you'd find whatever the secret was that caused him to do this.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Another family.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  It's deep in debt.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  Like, who knows.
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  And you didn't find any of that.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  But what becomes immediately clear is that your dad, just as of a few days earlier,
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  had been planning for the future.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  There's a Utah ski trip.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  There's the Willis.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  Did I fall asleep?
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  Is this after I woke up?
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  This is that night.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  Before he falls asleep.
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  No, before he falls asleep.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  This is the way you've told me.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  I mean, but if that's not your memory.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  No, I was just asking.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  I spaced out for a minute.
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  I was thinking about something else.
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  And then I said, before I fell asleep, yes.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  I started going through the computer.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  Yeah.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  And you noticed, so first of all, that he'd been planning for the future.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  And second of all, there were just enormous quantities of Deutsche Bank emails in his
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  person, in his Yahoo!
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  Gmail accounts.
[12:28.000 --> 12:34.000]  And even as you're going through the computer at that moment, one final Deutsche Bank email
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  arrives at 8.42 p.m.
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  That's about the schedule for an upcoming DBTCA board meeting.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  And none of this made any sense.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  And you're just wiped out and you swallowed a handful of morphine xanax and tried to
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  fall asleep.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  Yeah.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  I was crying.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  Yeah.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  I actually had written that and then it just felt like such a cliche.
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  But yeah, I hear you.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  You can write it better.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  I don't know how to write it better.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  It just, like, it almost seems like better left.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  I don't know.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  Yeah.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  I don't know.
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.000]  Okay.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  What's up, team?
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  January 27th.
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  You're dead.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  Death is announced to the bank by Anshu and Irrigan Fitchin.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  The bank sends over a beefy security guy to sanitize the flat.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  What security guy?
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  Oh yeah.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  Beefy.
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.000]  Yeah.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  He was a big dude.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  And to deal with the media, there's also a PR person.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  And the PR person advised you guys to just not say anything.
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  And there the PR, the bank's goal at that point was to avoid any published speculation
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  about why your dad had killed himself.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  That was the bank's goal, not your family's goal.
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.000]  And this is something, and you know, I recount some of the dissembling or lying that the
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  bank did about what was known about your dad's death in the days afterwards.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  Is there a split of it?
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  And it's including to me directly at the time.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  Family, friends cycling through.
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.000]  Alla having FaceTime conversations with the girls, sitting on the floor rocking back and
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  forth.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  You're in a corner, not knowing what you're supposed to do.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  You emailed Jenny.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  Everything's upside down on sideways right now.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  You wanted to flee the apartment, smoke cigarettes, clear your head.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  But Alla wouldn't let you leave.
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.000]  You were so desperate that you kind of cooked up an excuse to go get a haircut and clean
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  up.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  And that backfired, and Alla summoned Alla's hairdresser to the apartment and used to have
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  your dad's desk and got pampered.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  Pampered and got my haircut.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  Hairdresser leaves.
[14:57.000 --> 15:04.000]  Bank security man lets in a skinny tech guy from Deutsche Bank whose assignment, as far
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  as you and Beth could figure out, was to copy the contents of Bill's computers.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  It was very polite in his 20s.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  Came with portable hard drives.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  Someone at the house phoned the bank to make sure he was really supposed to be there.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  The bank confirmed he was legit.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  You brought him in to the office.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  The guy logged onto the computers and you watched him copy the files of the portable hard drives.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  I logged him on.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  The tech guy also took the papers that had been on the coffee table.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  So this is the second person now that is like showing an urgent interest.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  Wait, wait.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  The papers are on the coffee table.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  The DBTCI papers.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  Did he take the papers?
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  You're my source of that.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  I don't remember anymore because it would be severe to take the DBTCI papers.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  It's almost like evidence.
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.000]  Well, the police are gone at that point and that pretty clearly is the bank's property, right?
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  No, it's his property.
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  The papers are just him.
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  I don't think they took the DBTCI papers.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  I think he just took the drives because I don't remember anyone taking those papers.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  Okay.
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  I don't remember anyone taking them.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  Okay.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  Yeah.
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  In any case, this is now the second person is showing some like urgent interest in what's on your dad's computer.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  You at that point figured it prudent to preserve all of the digital access to all the shit.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  So you copied all down to the scrap paper.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  Yeah.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  I think if I said that I was wrong or maybe it was miscommunicated or something.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  Okay.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  That's fine.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  It's not a big deal.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  Okay.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  I'll cut that.
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  Okay.
[16:39.000 --> 16:49.000]  So eventually like the media clears out and you are allowed to leave and you start telling your friends what happened
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  and your friends weren't even sure what to believe.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  Like they thought maybe you were just really, really high or that you were exaggerating.
[16:58.000 --> 17:04.000]  They couldn't believe the story you were telling.
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  And finally you make it back to your own apartment near a loan and lonely.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  You can't get these horrible images out of your mind.
[17:11.000 --> 17:18.000]  And eventually you turned on, you remember what music you turned on?
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  I had Johnny Cash and I had the Sinead O'Connor.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  Yeah, that's the Sinead O'Connor.
[17:25.000 --> 17:32.000]  Same song that your dad had been listening to when he was in bed.
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.000]  Last day of our acquaintance.
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  Yeah.
[17:36.000 --> 17:43.000]  The lyrics of this are in the book.
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.000]  I've listened to that song quite a few times myself at this point.
[17:47.000 --> 17:55.000]  It's certainly a meaningful song.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  Okay.
[17:56.000 --> 18:02.000]  Off to New York people go, Allah needs the wheelchair to get out of JFK.
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.000]  She's had so many sedatives and that's like a rare moment of levity later in that week.
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.000]  You and Alessa and Kushka joke that it's like not the first time you're on a wheelchair to get around an airport.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Well, yeah, something like that.
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  It was that she was a princess, sorry, jokes.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  But not that she was so sedated all the time that she needed a wheelchair.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  No, no, it wasn't that.
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.000]  It was just a melodrama.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  Yeah, melodrama.
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  You flew on February 4th, you arranged to fly in the same plane as your dad's coffin.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  Someone needed to escort him on his final flight.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  At Heathrow, a board of guard, looks at your passport and realizes you've been your visa's
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  long since expired and now you can come back.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  It was actually more, because I got through passport control and then I thought I was clear
[18:48.000 --> 18:55.000]  and then there was one more last sort of more casual passport control where there were two guys.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  One guy had a podium on the right and he was a Sikh because he had the headdress
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  and then a white British guy on the left and you have to go through and they were just sort of eyeing you.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  And then the Sikh had been looking for me the whole time because as soon as he spotted me,
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  he was very brash, you, here.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  He knew exactly who I was.
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  So I guess the passport control informed these guys to stop me.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  It was somewhere in between.
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  And then they pulled me aside and searched through my things and I gave them the doctor's note
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  with all the drugs because they were surprised with all the drugs I had.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  And then they made me sign the paper.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  They gave me a choice of one year or ten years.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  You have all that, right?
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  And you have the paper.
[19:38.000 --> 19:47.000]  The plane lands at JFK a little before 10 o'clock and a hurst drives on to the tarmac to collect the bottom.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  Memorial service.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  Everyone who comes in gets a little laminated card with a picture of Bill smiling on one side
[19:55.000 --> 20:04.000]  and then Ruffle, Bill Emerson's poem about the meaning of successful life on the other side.
[20:04.000 --> 20:09.000]  Bob tells a bunch of family stories.
[20:09.000 --> 20:17.000]  Alessa reads a farewell letter that includes Peter and the wolf and how she would use to pick up his ties.
[20:17.000 --> 20:25.000]  You read a free lunchroom scripture, which I've got here.
[20:25.000 --> 20:31.000]  Michael Morandi and his eulogy notes how many hundreds of people are there.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  He says that if he's looking down at this assembly, he'd wonder what all the fuss is about.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  And then it's Alissa's turn and she reads, stop all the clocks.
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.000]  She's just going to heartbreaking and she has trouble making it through because she's crying so much.
[20:48.000 --> 20:56.000]  And then afterwards there's a memorial at the Park Avenue House in the kitchen of Bill.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  I forgot to give you, I have to give you my speech.
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  You never did give that to me.
[21:02.000 --> 21:10.000]  And there are a lot of guests in the apartment and one of them is Estelle, who is still her brother after all these years.
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  She approaches your mom and they hug and they both lost their men.
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.000]  And all the whispers in her ear, they are together now.
[21:21.000 --> 21:27.000]  Really? Does that make still sense?
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  Okay. You okay?
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  Yeah.
[21:32.000 --> 21:39.000]  Okay.
[21:39.000 --> 21:47.000]  So Bob Roach has a set of committee that's investigating the Renaissance text.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  Does he jump to Bob Roach?
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  Not exactly.
[21:51.000 --> 21:56.000]  Don't get excited.
[21:57.000 --> 22:09.000]  And so they do this investigation and as part of that they find this phone call where,
[22:09.000 --> 22:17.000]  well they find that Anshu has kind of assigned Bill back in 2008 the task of trying to make, to understand what these trades were about
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  and make sure everything was kosher.
[22:19.000 --> 22:20.000]  Cool.
[22:20.000 --> 22:27.000]  And he had basically said there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the way they were being handled
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  but he had this phone call with a colleague where he was very candid about the transaction's purpose.
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  And he says they were designed for tax reasons.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  And the phone calls were recorded.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  The phone calls were recorded?
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  Yeah.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  Okay.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  And the center investigators years later find that record them.
[22:45.000 --> 22:51.000]  And it's very problematic for the bank because the bank's point was that they're not for tax purposes.
[22:51.000 --> 22:58.000]  These were the legitimate business purposes and your dad has just been very candid and honest and open
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  and that is not in the bank's interest being candid and honest and open.
[23:01.000 --> 23:10.000]  And so a bunch of people were being brought over to testify under oath to the Senate
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000]  and were making this argument that they didn't have anything to do with tax purposes
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  and here your dad was on tape openly declaring that that's exactly what they were.
[23:19.000 --> 23:28.000]  And so it turns out that one afternoon in the late in the previous summer, so probably August or September of 2013,
[23:29.000 --> 23:41.000]  some attorneys came from Paul Weiss to the big law firm to London to interview your dad about his role in the rest on the streets.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  Right.
[23:42.000 --> 23:52.000]  And it was kind of a routine interview and their goal was to figure out what your dad knew about the trades
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  that you guys take on all the documents and recordings that the investigators had obtained.
[23:56.000 --> 24:05.000]  It's held around the corner from Deutsche's offices and they sat at like a very highly polished wooden table
[24:05.000 --> 24:13.000]  and the lawyers told him that there's a chance he was going to have to go to Washington and be interviewed under oath on Capitol Hill.
[24:13.000 --> 24:22.000]  And Bill, he was very polite and forthcoming and he struck the lawyers as terrified.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  He had a hang dog look.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  He seemed beaten down, world weary.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  The meeting ends, the attorneys go back to...
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  Is this according to Bob Roach?
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  What was that?
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  This is according to Bob Roach.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  No, this isn't Bob Roach.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  This is...
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  Bob Roach isn't here.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  Is this Paul Weiss?
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  The attorneys?
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  I'm not saying this is according to him.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  This is the way it was perceived.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  Okay.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  The lawyers go back to Heathrow to catch their flight back to New York and they're waiting in the airport lounge.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  And one of them is a phone call and it's Bill.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  And he's got a million other questions about what he needs to do next.
[24:56.000 --> 25:04.000]  The way this is described to me is that Bill seemed to be bracing for a world of shit to land on him at any moment.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  He sounded terrified, he sounded slightly unhinged and the lawyers were very worried.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  Unhinged?
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  Okay.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  So...
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  Okay.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  Unhinged, so it's...
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  Okay, I'm just curious.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  So the lawyers describe him as unhinged on the phone?
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  Just out of worry?
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.000]  They thought he seemed very scared, out of complete...
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  Completely disproportionate.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  Right.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  To what any of the real risks were.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  Great.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  Okay.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  So...
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  You...
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  A few days after the memorial service, you decided that you needed help.
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  Taking too many drugs.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  It's hard to get drugs in America, at least hard compared to London.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  Well, the prescription. Hard to get the prescription.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what I've got.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  Beth is gone.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  So you sit down with your mom and your sisters and Uncle Bob.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  And you discuss what you're gonna do.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  You want to go to rehab.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  You want the family to pay for it.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  And Ola's less than enthusiastic about that.
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  And in part because she perceived you as having...
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  Her perception was that you were being ungrateful and entitled to not interested in suffering in some third-grade rehab facility.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  This is her perception.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  What?
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  No, they didn't want me to go at all.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  No, I know.
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.000]  I was about to say, she said that you should just hunker down for a few days at the university club and snap it on your own.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  You knew from your experience that that was an unsupervised approach like that would not work.
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  You wrote your mom a letter on the university club's letter and say, I'm a grown man, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  And eventually they agreed to send you to rehab in detox in Florida.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  And so you go to sunrise detox.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  You didn't take them up on the offer of comfort drugs and so you just went cold turkey.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  And it was awful.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  And you spend a lot of time in the shower crying.
[27:33.000 --> 27:41.000]  When you weren't doing that, you were picking fights with the religious fundamentalists who were your fellow patients.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  You didn't make friends.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  So after 10 days there, you transferred to the Lucida Rehab Center.
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.000]  Which turned out, despite its advertisements to the contrary, was basically like a construction site too large.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  Yeah.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  You were pissed off about the subpart conditions.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  You convinced some of your fellow guests to leave.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  Yeah, I was a total asshole.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  What was that?
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  I was a total asshole.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  One day you're about a weekend.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  You're summoned to the boardroom.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  You show up in a bathing suit to protest the lack of swimming pool.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  Tonight.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  The staff tells them you're kicked out.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  You threw a bit of a tantrum.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  The tantrum, not surprisingly, did not dissuade them of kicking you out.
[28:30.000 --> 28:36.000]  Alessa took pity on her big brother.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  You were in a bad situation and needed help.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  So she found another rehab facility, Altamira.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  And Altamira's nice.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  And they're good chefs.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  And you got a welcome basket with high-end toiletries.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  And I've been here, I've been meaning to tennis with you.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  That it was 50 grand a month?
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Yeah.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  That's amazing.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  That's really expensive.
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  Yeah, I know.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  Back in New York, family hired a consultant to advise them on how to deal with you.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  I didn't want to be there at that point.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  I remember I wanted to go home.
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  That's all I wanted to do was just go back.
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  I realized this whole thing was a terrible, terrible idea.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  Why?
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  It was just a bad idea.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  Why?
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.000]  It was a bad time to go to rehab.
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  I need to be with my family.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  I didn't want to do this.
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.000]  Drugs were much more comforting than anything else at the time.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  And I think I probably needed that to get through this.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  And I should have been with my sisters and my mom.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  I realized this terrible idea.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  I kept saying, I don't want to go to rehab.
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  Let's go back to New York.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  It's over.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  It's done.
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  And then they said, no, no, no.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  Stay here.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  Stay here.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  I want to go back to New York.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  I was in a place that I lived.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  Yeah.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  Yeah.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  And I used that 50,000 years ago.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  50,000 a month.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  That's 600,000 dollars a year.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  It's like 50,000 a month.
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  Yeah.
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  It was ridiculous.
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  I said, this is ridiculous.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  I just need to go back to New York, find a place to live and be with the family, and move on.
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  And spend the year in New York.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  Because I had to do a year in New York.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  Do a year in New York.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  I'm banned from England for one year.
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.440]  Stay away from the England and we had started looking at apartments
[30:15.440 --> 30:17.160]  I don't know if you put that in there as well
[30:17.160 --> 30:23.240]  My mom found a real estate person and had me go with her to look at apartments for rent around 93rd Street
[30:24.480 --> 30:29.640]  We had been looking for places and then said well go to rehab first and come back. We'll find a place
[30:30.240 --> 30:34.960]  And after I did the detox in the another ten days at Lucida
[30:35.680 --> 30:41.000]  Or two weeks of Lucida the fill that was enough. I didn't want to go to Altamira. It was not my
[30:41.720 --> 30:47.680]  Intention I was not throwing a fit like spend money on me to go to a fancy rehab. No, it was I want to go home
[30:47.920 --> 30:49.920]  Spend no money on rehab. Let's just
[30:50.880 --> 30:52.560]  Start again in New York
[30:52.560 --> 30:56.120]  So I mean you could have surely if you didn't want to go there in the first place
[30:56.120 --> 30:58.120]  You could have just not gotten on that plane to San Francisco
[30:58.720 --> 31:02.920]  Yeah, I know I could not because they had a something called sober companion
[31:03.200 --> 31:10.400]  That my sister and my mom and my uncle hired to fly out to Florida and accompany me to San Francisco
[31:10.400 --> 31:13.160]  I didn't know that yeah, yeah sober companion
[31:13.160 --> 31:18.040]  So there's a person that makes sure I didn't run away and didn't get drunk or get high or do anything like that
[31:18.240 --> 31:22.160]  There's a whole another one of those sub businesses or
[31:24.080 --> 31:28.960]  Associated with the rehab industry sober companions. So, yeah, they escorted me
[31:30.240 --> 31:32.240]  Yeah, I thought I told you that
[31:33.640 --> 31:35.640]  It's impossible you did
[31:36.200 --> 31:40.720]  Yeah, no, that's them you can go verify that so it wasn't I didn't get on the plane
[31:41.040 --> 31:46.400]  It was they wanted me to so badly. They hired this person to make sure I got from point A to point B
[31:47.160 --> 31:49.160]  They did not want me coming back to New York
[31:51.400 --> 31:56.680]  Okay, so I'm quoting from one of these letters that's important. No, I hear you
[31:56.680 --> 32:03.680]  Yeah, I hear you and look at make a note of that. Well, I've got we've got notes recording in multiple different directions here, so
[32:04.680 --> 32:06.680]  Um, sorry, Marie
[32:11.360 --> 32:13.680]  Yeah, no, no, I haven't yet a great question
[32:15.200 --> 32:19.960]  Yeah, yeah, but that's why there wasn't an option. It wasn't an option
[32:23.560 --> 32:26.800]  Yeah, I thought I told you guys sometimes I
[32:27.920 --> 32:31.880]  Think I yeah, maybe someone else I told but yeah
[32:32.880 --> 32:40.880]  Okay, so the consultant says quote as you have seen the balance mindset in the past has enabled him to become dependent on not only drugs
[32:40.880 --> 32:42.880]  But people and to thus not mature
[32:46.280 --> 32:51.080]  That's a quote from the family consultant advising them on how to deal with you
[32:52.680 --> 32:57.480]  This is around the time. Yeah, this is March of 2014
[32:58.240 --> 33:03.240]  Is this the family is this the one that is a genetic freedom? Yes, this is the terrible genetic freedom. Yeah
[33:03.760 --> 33:08.400]  Yeah, there's something wrong with this woman and my mom there. They had like mobbed up
[33:09.240 --> 33:14.960]  And she was I never met this person and she was consulting my mom for a lot of money per month
[33:14.960 --> 33:20.600]  And she had Freeman was not only a consultant for me to go to rehab. She was a therapist for my mom
[33:21.320 --> 33:26.560]  So everything my mom said she filtered in and then actions were taken toward me
[33:27.080 --> 33:30.680]  So I was she was part of my list of evildoers
[33:43.440 --> 33:46.880]  Speed number six resuming
[33:47.680 --> 33:49.680]  Okay
[33:52.600 --> 33:54.600]  So
[33:55.560 --> 34:01.520]  So in consultation with the consultant therapist
[34:03.280 --> 34:09.400]  Your mom hasn't communicated to you via Altamira that if you're
[34:10.880 --> 34:13.040]  If you manage to get a job outside of rehab
[34:13.040 --> 34:18.320]  They might be willing to supplement your income, but they're not interested in funding some sort of itinerant lifestyle
[34:18.320 --> 34:23.520]  And she instructed the staff at Altamira to inform you that if you left the facility
[34:24.280 --> 34:25.920]  She would sever
[34:25.920 --> 34:27.920]  She wouldn't she would stop the money
[34:29.600 --> 34:31.600]  Well, she'd already stopped
[34:32.800 --> 34:41.280]  So what point were we at in first month of Altamira? This is March 19th 2014. Yeah, so she'd already stopped money and
[34:42.160 --> 34:46.840]  She was well, but at this point she's paying $50,000 a month free of rehab, right?
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.760]  And if she says that if she if you leave rehab, right, she will not be paying you any money
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.240]  Right, and yes, she has stopped paying you at that point, but she's essentially is paying right
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.600]  It's not going to your pocket. It's going to Altamira's pocket, but they're feeding and yeah, right?
[35:02.600 --> 35:05.680]  You know it would be important to make the difference, but yeah
[35:07.440 --> 35:10.800]  So you were under the impression that you were just gonna spend a month there
[35:10.920 --> 35:14.080]  But the end of a month the staff told you you can't go anywhere
[35:14.640 --> 35:20.160]  You stayed put miserable you miss London you miss drugs you miss miss Beth you missed your father and
[35:21.160 --> 35:25.180]  You found yourself my dad. Yeah, so that
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.880]  Is that right? Yeah, and you found yourself something like I've snapped in you
[35:33.080 --> 35:37.040]  Over the past couple of months and you found yourself thinking more and more about your time in foster care
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.080]  And how you'd been deserted and how your mother resented you and you emailed Jenny. I think it was Jenny
[35:43.720 --> 35:45.720]  Yeah, it was Jenny you emailed her
[35:46.720 --> 35:52.760]  Around that time saying it's a shit year so far. It's weird. I cried and felt everything until I came here now
[35:52.760 --> 35:54.760]  I'm numb and disconnected. Yeah
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.600]  Later that spring all in Beth come out to San Francisco for family week
[36:00.160 --> 36:01.960]  It's clear to Beth
[36:01.960 --> 36:07.720]  That all expected Altamira to just solve your problems and release a clean rehabilitated grown-up
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.840]  Which obviously is not the way these things work
[36:09.840 --> 36:14.960]  Yeah, and you were to see them with anger toward your mother your sisters your doctors
[36:15.280 --> 36:18.560]  Yeah, because I don't want to be this is now the third month. Yep
[36:18.560 --> 36:21.320]  It's three months at each time. Let's stay one more month
[36:21.320 --> 36:26.720]  I would give you back your all your stuff and then eventually it was just the kick-bath out of my apartment
[36:27.360 --> 36:29.360]  Put all my shit in storage
[36:30.080 --> 36:37.300]  Got rid of the apartment. I mean it was all back in London. This is back in the wild back in London. Yeah, and you and this
[36:37.660 --> 36:44.020]  Yeah, no, I'm not yeah, I get it. I mean, I can't even really imagine but there's
[36:46.500 --> 36:52.860]  This is when you have the blow-up at your mom in this group therapy session and all the pent-up rate comes out and
[36:53.940 --> 36:58.100]  You say that when dad died your worst fears and the secret dreams came true at once
[36:59.540 --> 37:01.300]  She wasn't
[37:01.300 --> 37:03.620]  She wasn't in the right state of mind to make these
[37:04.340 --> 37:08.420]  Big life-changing decisions that she was making and that's why you know
[37:10.420 --> 37:12.780]  And that was the last time you saw that too, right? Yeah
[37:17.340 --> 37:19.340]  All is start to know that sir
[37:20.740 --> 37:24.900]  She was there too, but you left her out. Yeah, I don't have her in there
[37:25.380 --> 37:27.380]  Um
[37:28.980 --> 37:33.220]  All is kind of venturing I know not the last time I saw this again, right you saw her in New York. Yeah
[37:34.020 --> 37:35.460]  Uh
[37:35.460 --> 37:38.260]  But I'm just not getting into any of that. Yeah, so um
[37:40.580 --> 37:42.580]  I am uh
[37:42.740 --> 37:48.100]  Explained how all it kind of is starting bit by bit to come out of her shell going to art classes wearing dark glasses
[37:48.660 --> 37:50.660]  things like that
[37:51.220 --> 37:53.060]  Uh
[37:53.060 --> 37:57.780]  Quoted from some of her emails where she every time like a new public scandal comes to light a Deutsche bank
[37:58.020 --> 38:02.660]  And on one occasion she writes to someone my poor brilliant bill. What did they make them do?
[38:03.620 --> 38:07.140]  Um, and she worried about money. She worried that she didn't fit in
[38:07.780 --> 38:09.780]  The therapist told her to relax
[38:10.020 --> 38:12.020]  um
[38:13.620 --> 38:15.460]  Uh
[38:15.460 --> 38:18.980]  She believed um that Deutsche
[38:20.740 --> 38:22.100]  owed her
[38:22.100 --> 38:27.460]  From bill free bills years of years of hard work. She toyed with a wrongful death lawsuit
[38:28.180 --> 38:31.460]  Uh lured to be in researching those possibilities
[38:32.420 --> 38:33.940]  um
[38:33.940 --> 38:38.100]  This is by the time oh and she comes across and concurrently I felt the same
[38:39.220 --> 38:41.540]  Um without talking to my mom
[38:42.420 --> 38:49.140]  I was looking into that too throughout 2015. So all those lawyers 2014, right? This is 2014
[38:50.100 --> 38:51.860]  uh all is
[38:51.860 --> 38:57.140]  So they've researched this and ultimately there is going to be no wrongful death lawsuit and the bank agrees
[38:57.860 --> 38:58.820]  to
[38:58.820 --> 39:01.220]  pay out to her over a period of years
[39:02.020 --> 39:03.460]  the
[39:03.460 --> 39:09.140]  And it's several million dollars in payments that were due to bill but that had invested at the time of his death
[39:09.940 --> 39:13.540]  Um, not the deferments. Yeah, these are deferments
[39:13.540 --> 39:18.020]  So like his death would invalidate those deferments and they agreed to not invalidate them
[39:18.420 --> 39:25.060]  And actually gradually pay them out and around that time is when a la gives up this idea of wrongful death lawsuit against the bank
[39:25.780 --> 39:27.780]  um
[39:28.340 --> 39:31.060]  So a la and the girls go to main to scatter the ashes
[39:31.620 --> 39:32.820]  um
[39:32.820 --> 39:35.780]  The you weren't invited and obviously were
[39:36.660 --> 39:39.060]  Horribly hurt by that. Um, it's unbelievable
[39:40.180 --> 39:41.940]  Yeah
[39:41.940 --> 39:46.180]  But yeah, so going on this is now we're in spring 2014. Yeah
[39:46.980 --> 39:48.900]  um at
[39:48.900 --> 39:54.580]  The perception that you had was that your mom was trying to recast her life with you out of it
[39:55.540 --> 40:02.580]  And that wasn't entirely unfounded and she was telling new acquaintances around that time that uh,
[40:02.660 --> 40:06.020]  She had two daughters and when it eventually emerged that she had a son too
[40:06.180 --> 40:09.620]  She would refuse to talk about him describing you as a forbidden subject
[40:11.940 --> 40:13.940]  Um
[40:14.900 --> 40:21.300]  You didn't understand why she was doing this and it you suspected that maybe it's because she was hiding something
[40:22.340 --> 40:24.340]  and it, uh
[40:24.660 --> 40:29.220]  I'm knowing it didn't occur to you that your actions might have
[40:30.100 --> 40:36.580]  Also contributed to this. I guess you're in particular your explosion at ultimaria, which I thought that was disproportionate to everything else
[40:37.700 --> 40:42.580]  Um, I mean I've exploited her before she's exploited me before this is nothing
[40:43.220 --> 40:49.060]  Well, I think that was a particular explosion. It's okay. They're all particular. I'm not there. No, I'm not I'm not I'm not
[40:49.220 --> 40:54.340]  Not a sign of blame. No, but I I started believing that it was more than just me. That's why I mean if it was just me
[40:54.340 --> 40:58.340]  That's an obvious explanation if and I could deal with that. It's not like I was
[40:58.900 --> 41:03.540]  Fooling myself, but when I look at the bigger picture that something else is happening and that's why I agree more suspicious
[41:03.860 --> 41:08.020]  I'm not suggesting at all. That's why I actually plan to get into the emails because I had to find out more
[41:08.020 --> 41:09.620]  Oh, it's funny you say that
[41:09.620 --> 41:14.260]  It's funny you say that maybe the answers are at least clues. We're hiding in Bill's electronic file. There you go. Okay. So, uh,
[41:15.140 --> 41:19.300]  We're we're in sync man. They're in sync. I've been listening carefully. Um,
[41:20.420 --> 41:22.420]  and I'm noting here that
[41:23.380 --> 41:26.820]  You the you've written down all these the codes as I in the passwords
[41:27.380 --> 41:32.980]  And they had helped previously helped uncle bob get in for some online accounts and now in ultimaria
[41:33.540 --> 41:39.140]  You started looking through the yahoo account and hunting for clues that might explain your mom's behavior
[41:39.860 --> 41:41.300]  and it
[41:41.300 --> 41:46.340]  so this is where we first learned about in the narrative here about, uh,
[41:47.780 --> 41:50.740]  uh, Reverend Jack's death, which is a few years earlier
[41:51.380 --> 41:52.660]  um
[41:52.660 --> 41:58.020]  And hang out with that an effective bill. I don't know if you remember this email, but um,
[41:58.900 --> 42:00.660]  yeah
[42:00.660 --> 42:02.420]  sort of vaguely
[42:02.420 --> 42:04.340]  He'd been
[42:04.340 --> 42:08.420]  He'd really sunk into it. It hit him really really hard and
[42:09.060 --> 42:15.460]  At one point after his so your grandfather after i'm told jack's more or Reverend Jack's memorial service
[42:16.420 --> 42:20.980]  Bill emailed a friend or a friend even bill saying that he had looked dazed
[42:21.700 --> 42:27.140]  At the memorial service and bill replied it was a much deeper below than I'd expected given his very long and well-lived life
[42:27.860 --> 42:29.860]  um
[42:29.860 --> 42:31.700]  and we know
[42:31.700 --> 42:32.820]  that
[42:32.820 --> 42:34.820]  he had been that
[42:34.820 --> 42:36.420]  bills had been
[42:36.420 --> 42:38.740]  You know turn into his mom his widow
[42:39.460 --> 42:40.820]  for very
[42:40.820 --> 42:41.700]  just
[42:41.700 --> 42:43.700]  He was really really hit him hard
[42:44.500 --> 42:46.500]  anyway, you um
[42:46.900 --> 42:51.220]  You're crying now and the more you read the more you cry and you put on
[42:51.700 --> 42:53.700]  anti-hiding the black crows
[42:54.900 --> 42:57.140]  Think of the volume so that other people won't hear you crying
[42:58.820 --> 43:00.820]  um
[43:01.060 --> 43:05.220]  You leave ultimaria at the end early early july so you can spend their four months there
[43:05.300 --> 43:08.180]  You go to silver living house strong in starry manor
[43:09.220 --> 43:10.180]  um
[43:10.180 --> 43:13.700]  This is where I would meet peggy. Yep. So you gotta put her in here
[43:14.820 --> 43:18.820]  Well, no, you met her at all from here. Yeah. Yeah. So now we're in starry manor
[43:19.380 --> 43:24.180]  Yeah, okay. Um, did you include peggy? So she no I haven't included because I just
[43:24.580 --> 43:27.300]  We haven't figured out how we're doing that. Okay, um
[43:28.340 --> 43:30.340]  But yeah, I agree that's where
[43:30.580 --> 43:32.580]  Um
[43:33.380 --> 43:35.380]  Um
[43:36.420 --> 43:41.540]  So here I tell the brief story of spencer. Yeah, spencer Jesus. Um
[43:42.660 --> 43:45.860]  Do you want to go through this or not really? I mean you know the story I know the story
[43:46.980 --> 43:51.860]  I mean you and sophie and spencer sitting around spencer excuses himself goes to the bathroom
[43:52.100 --> 43:54.100]  Doesn't come back you guys go look
[43:54.260 --> 43:56.260]  Knock on the door. He doesn't answer
[43:56.420 --> 44:00.260]  Turn open the door to one shut you kick it open. He's passed out the floor face blue
[44:00.980 --> 44:02.740]  over us and
[44:02.740 --> 44:07.540]  You cradle him while he while you wait for the paramax to arrive and you're sitting there
[44:08.020 --> 44:11.060]  Clear as past. Yeah, so he doesn't show up in his vomit and
[44:11.780 --> 44:16.580]  Wondering if this is going to be the second time any in the year that you've seen in the room of the dead man
[44:17.940 --> 44:22.180]  I'm obviously noting that he survived, but then a year later didn't
[44:22.820 --> 44:24.820]  um
[44:25.780 --> 44:27.780]  Um
[44:29.700 --> 44:36.020]  So what continues to drive you crazy at this point is you don't understand why your dad did this it's uh
[44:39.060 --> 44:40.660]  And his death
[44:40.660 --> 44:45.940]  Even though he says in his note. He like suicide note to you. He apologizes for his coldness to you at times
[44:46.820 --> 44:48.180]  he
[44:48.180 --> 44:50.740]  He also he was like a stabilizing presence in the family
[44:50.900 --> 44:53.620]  He defended you when all of us seemed ready to give up
[44:54.420 --> 44:56.020]  and now
[44:56.020 --> 45:01.540]  You're not coincidentally you're already the black sheep and now you're really a black sheep in the family
[45:02.500 --> 45:04.500]  Why is where you meet Sophia?
[45:05.460 --> 45:07.460]  Um Sophie
[45:08.660 --> 45:10.660]  Sophie yeah, that's good. Thank you
[45:11.780 --> 45:13.780]  um
[45:14.500 --> 45:16.500]  Duh
[45:16.820 --> 45:24.020]  She has a lot of patience with you and it and really likes you and it when you yell at her
[45:25.140 --> 45:30.420]  She doesn't run away. She said don't talk to me like that. I get it. You're in pain. You flash out. I'm not gonna run away from you
[45:31.220 --> 45:32.260]  and
[45:32.260 --> 45:33.140]  uh
[45:33.140 --> 45:34.340]  You guys
[45:34.340 --> 45:36.740]  Bond and she tries to convince you
[45:37.620 --> 45:42.340]  That your family doesn't hate you if they did hate you. Why would they be putting up in these nice facilities?
[45:42.900 --> 45:46.180]  She knows from her personal experience that they're in my worst facilities to be in
[45:47.060 --> 45:49.380]  If our families didn't give a shit about us, they wouldn't put us here
[45:50.340 --> 45:52.500]  um
[45:52.500 --> 45:56.100]  You keep telling her I'm sure we're that simple, but it's really not
[45:56.900 --> 45:59.620]  But she has a very simplistic way of looking at these things
[46:00.980 --> 46:02.980]  She's a good person
[46:04.900 --> 46:06.900]  Um, sorry
[46:07.220 --> 46:11.620]  So so you keep saying over and over again you want to figure out why
[46:12.580 --> 46:16.660]  Your dad did this and that there's no way he just like offed himself one day
[46:17.540 --> 46:20.180]  And so if he tries to warn you off and says no one will ever know
[46:20.820 --> 46:24.660]  Ask them the question over and over again. You're just torturing yourself and even if you do figure out the answer
[46:24.820 --> 46:26.820]  What do you do with that information?
[46:28.340 --> 46:30.340]  You keep looking
[46:30.500 --> 46:32.500]  um
[46:32.580 --> 46:36.900]  It started if they have realized what's in these email accounts and there's all this
[46:37.140 --> 46:41.940]  You know personal information about like all the logistic family logistics and meeting up with friends
[46:42.580 --> 46:45.060]  There's a copious quantities of spam
[46:45.860 --> 46:46.900]  um
[46:46.900 --> 46:48.580]  Which made you
[46:48.580 --> 46:54.100]  Kind of laughed yourself that maybe you'd like put his email in to get some to get access to a phone website at some point
[46:54.980 --> 46:59.540]  And then there's all this don't you back stuff and uh, this is where you started to vote in
[47:00.180 --> 47:02.180]  Let's do your time and energy
[47:02.180 --> 47:04.180]  Especially given that you knew
[47:04.180 --> 47:10.420]  That one of the suicide notes had been to on shoe and so that clearly suggests that doge event was at least on his mind at the time of his death
[47:10.500 --> 47:15.220]  Yeah, and so you start scavenging and it
[47:16.340 --> 47:20.420]  You know, there are little things that you can make sense of there's clear that uh
[47:21.380 --> 47:25.620]  You can tell from some of this dbtca emails that your dad is angry at times and like
[47:26.580 --> 47:31.220]  Especially about the stress tests, but most of this is just golly good. You can't you don't understand
[47:32.260 --> 47:34.740]  What it means and so this is where I enter the story
[47:35.380 --> 47:37.380]  um
[47:38.020 --> 47:41.860]  And I tell the story quickly you answer before this you answer in february
[47:41.940 --> 47:49.300]  Well, I this it says five months early earlier. I contacted the bell, right? Uh, so there I tell that story and I mention
[47:50.580 --> 47:57.700]  That just kind of our online flirtations basically over four or five months again provide me shit right and had just like
[47:58.420 --> 47:59.300]  been
[47:59.300 --> 48:01.300]  really annoying
[48:01.700 --> 48:03.620]  You were equally annoying
[48:03.620 --> 48:09.620]  The constant calls and emails. Yeah, we're gonna go in two days. Well, you know, if we don't hear from you
[48:09.620 --> 48:14.100]  I'm just gonna write whatever I want. I don't think I said quite that but there is paraphrasing
[48:14.340 --> 48:18.340]  You at one point. I don't know if you remember this sent a picture of a picture to me
[48:18.580 --> 48:25.460]  Yeah, like an Ivan picture of a fire in downtown San Francisco. Yeah, and uh, this is a very cryptic you
[48:26.420 --> 48:28.020]  We knew exactly where you were
[48:28.020 --> 48:34.020]  Yeah, because we could see in the photos property. So we we located you on the back patio of ultimera. Oh, you did?
[48:34.740 --> 48:36.740]  I didn't know that. That's funny
[48:36.980 --> 48:38.980]  Um, oh no. Yeah, you didn't tell me that
[48:41.140 --> 48:48.100]  Did you do geolocation you you write really was it the tags in the front in the photo? Yeah, okay. I didn't strip the tags
[48:48.900 --> 48:50.900]  Yeah, that was sloppy. Yeah
[48:51.380 --> 48:55.220]  Not good not good spike right there. Really terrible spike craft. Yeah. I was just learning
[48:56.180 --> 48:57.860]  So anyway in july
[48:57.860 --> 49:02.100]  I was just starting out Tuesday evening mid july it's two weeks after you arrived at starboard man
[49:02.100 --> 49:05.140]  Are you sending me an email and said are you still looking into deutcha?
[49:05.780 --> 49:07.380]  And I said yes
[49:07.380 --> 49:12.900]  And you kind of explain the situation and asked for some keywords jenny strassberg and I sent a bunch of keywords
[49:13.860 --> 49:19.140]  Um, which I've got to say looking back on them now are pretty good keywords. Yeah, never good subpoena
[49:19.620 --> 49:21.140]  DOJ
[49:21.140 --> 49:27.060]  FRBNY that's good federal which we're bringing here good way to start live or christian bittar mori napaski
[49:27.940 --> 49:31.300]  often good good good job journalists
[49:32.980 --> 49:37.620]  Yeah, a lot of the troidex in a lot of them I repeat you still send them some of those keywords
[49:38.420 --> 49:40.420]  Absolutely. Yeah, I
[49:41.860 --> 49:45.780]  With the with the emissions trading stuff you sent the some similar keywords
[49:45.860 --> 49:47.060]  uh
[49:47.060 --> 49:50.020]  So you start sending stuff over most of it was useless
[49:50.420 --> 49:53.860]  Kind of interesting but like not very useful and then at 1 33 in the morning
[49:54.740 --> 49:58.500]  On july 18th. You sent the mother load
[49:58.900 --> 50:01.380]  Uh, or another mother load, but the jackpot one
[50:02.180 --> 50:07.700]  I professed it by saying don't know what this means, but and it was the letter that's a mere fed
[50:07.780 --> 50:12.020]  But does you include my strategy of trying to get you fired? No, I did not
[50:12.740 --> 50:17.540]  That's a that was that was later anyway. No, that was during the time
[50:18.500 --> 50:22.980]  It was well, it's a little bit later, but it was right around the time of publishing the fed letter
[50:23.620 --> 50:28.500]  That I realized. Okay. This is the plan. This is my revenge to your wall street journal. Yeah, I'm not
[50:28.580 --> 50:35.540]  I could use you for this so ridiculous. It's not ridiculous as charles was I explained the whole plan of charles
[50:36.100 --> 50:38.100]  I told you that you could verify with charles
[50:38.820 --> 50:43.620]  You explain the whole thing and so did sydney sydney can also verify and peggy, of course could but she can't now
[50:44.500 --> 50:46.740]  Not a good plan. It was a great plan
[50:47.380 --> 50:51.540]  It was because there was no purpose to the plan. The purpose was to get you fired. Right. No, I get that
[50:52.340 --> 50:56.740]  This discredited the wall street journal, right, but to what end just for my own
[50:57.220 --> 51:03.620]  Just because you want to destroy something I felt like destroying something right, but we had not actually done anything to deserve destruction
[51:03.860 --> 51:05.860]  No, but I felt in my
[51:06.020 --> 51:11.300]  It was very angry at the time and I felt I didn't have an outlet for the anger. So I picked wall street journal
[51:11.860 --> 51:14.500]  Well, it didn't work. No, I didn't go through with it
[51:15.060 --> 51:20.900]  Because of the sony hack but had the sony hack not happened. I would have gone through with it. I really would have so okay
[51:21.620 --> 51:26.020]  It's important. I think that's a good part of the story because it shows the anger, you know
[51:26.660 --> 51:30.900]  I had no direction for it and although it was misguided. I just put it upon you guys
[51:30.980 --> 51:32.980]  And that's kind of how the relationship
[51:32.980 --> 51:35.620]  We we continued relationship and a lot of it was out of anger
[51:36.020 --> 51:39.780]  And you were useful to me at the time as well and obviously I was useful to you
[51:40.180 --> 51:45.460]  But I also had an ulterior motive and that was to destroy your credibility and the wall street journal's credibility
[51:45.540 --> 51:49.060]  But I don't understand but you never you only gave you useful stuff
[51:49.700 --> 51:54.420]  I know because the plan was to give you useful stuff until you stopped fact checking everything I gave you
[51:55.380 --> 51:57.380]  That was a serious problem
[51:57.540 --> 52:01.540]  No, but no but at some point if I just keep you giving you great stuff and you
[52:02.260 --> 52:04.740]  You just okay. This is from val obviously. It's good
[52:05.220 --> 52:10.340]  You know at some point and when that when that thresholds crossed then they changed a few numbers here and there
[52:11.060 --> 52:14.900]  And then you publish something and then the stock market reacts
[52:15.300 --> 52:21.140]  And I write a letter to the editor and I say excuse me, but it looks like I went over this
[52:21.940 --> 52:26.740]  Spreadsheet and it looks like these numbers have changed since the moment I gave it to david and the moment it was published
[52:26.900 --> 52:31.540]  In in the wall street journal and then I just leave it alone and let the rest of the world react
[52:31.700 --> 52:35.700]  That was a plan. I told charles with this plan in the car when he came to visit me
[52:35.700 --> 52:39.860]  I know I know you I know you did told peggie. I told this is not a not a good plan
[52:40.180 --> 52:42.180]  I may rather than it's good or bad
[52:42.820 --> 52:45.220]  It speaks to your state of mind. It doesn't matter. It's a state of mind
[52:45.380 --> 52:49.700]  And it's also interesting because that was my relationship to you at that time not only
[52:50.340 --> 52:55.940]  Was you helping me and I was helping you but this was my got my purpose. I hear you. Okay, so
[52:57.140 --> 53:00.420]  You I think you should include this. I really think I hear you
[53:00.980 --> 53:04.260]  I don't know why you're just reticent to include that because
[53:06.340 --> 53:08.340]  It's kind of funny in a way
[53:08.340 --> 53:14.100]  Looking back is funny. I mean not not so funny to me, honestly, but like
[53:14.660 --> 53:18.340]  Okay, maybe not to you that's uh state of mind. I was in
[53:18.980 --> 53:23.300]  Yeah, that's I mean, I think it's pretty clear at this point that you're not in a great state of mind
[53:24.100 --> 53:26.100]  Uh, so
[53:26.420 --> 53:29.220]  Um, anyway, we do the story
[53:30.260 --> 53:34.580]  Uh stock can save it for the the director's cut and you get scenes
[53:37.060 --> 53:42.500]  Uh, we do the story doge bank stock gets whacked pretty hard and you have a feeling of
[53:43.220 --> 53:45.860]  Efficacy. Yeah, you did something. I made a difference
[53:47.140 --> 53:49.140]  Um
[53:49.380 --> 53:51.060]  Had value
[53:51.060 --> 53:54.900]  Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. Exactly. What do you had had value and it?
[53:55.620 --> 53:57.380]  um
[53:57.380 --> 53:59.380]  Okay, so
[53:59.540 --> 54:02.660]  Charlie Gimbino kills himself uh that fall
[54:03.380 --> 54:06.820]  So that's now two doge bank people. Did you get a hold of them at all?
[54:07.700 --> 54:09.700]  I'm not gonna get into that right now. Um
[54:10.740 --> 54:12.020]  Yes
[54:12.020 --> 54:16.100]  No, that's not necessarily yes, uh close. There's uh
[54:16.660 --> 54:17.860]  Uh
[54:17.860 --> 54:22.020]  So Gimbino's death to you at the time was like
[54:22.980 --> 54:27.940]  It was just like fuel for you because it it like really invigorated you not like in a way
[54:29.220 --> 54:34.900]  It got you it was like it gave you the energy to push forward and like really investigate the reasons for your dad's death even more
[54:35.700 --> 54:39.460]  And completing that became kind of an addiction for you. Um
[54:41.780 --> 54:43.940]  Uh, you thought this was a soluble problem
[54:43.940 --> 54:47.300]  You told me think of suicide as the most rational act a human can make
[54:47.700 --> 54:50.100]  Then work backwards from that. Sure. It's an emotional act
[54:50.100 --> 54:53.460]  Which is why many people get lost and explain it away as crazy or unknowable
[54:53.700 --> 54:55.700]  But if you look at the reasoning it makes sense
[54:56.100 --> 54:59.300]  Unfortunately, my father didn't leave a reason but he left clues
[54:59.940 --> 55:03.300]  And so those clues are you're convinced are buried
[55:03.860 --> 55:08.260]  In these emails and you still don't really know fine entity this itunes u-class
[55:09.140 --> 55:11.140]  um
[55:11.220 --> 55:12.900]  Which i've watched by the way
[55:12.980 --> 55:15.300]  Thanks, you've watched yeah, yeah, um it's pretty good
[55:17.220 --> 55:18.820]  Um
[55:18.820 --> 55:25.380]  But still all of this is like pretty murky. You don't really understand this and this is when north koreans
[55:26.180 --> 55:30.180]  Come into the picture. They hack sony that murky. I mean give me a better understanding
[55:31.540 --> 55:38.180]  What do you mean like the equilibrium theory parts? I mean live it was no no no no no no my point is it puts you in the headspace of finance
[55:38.180 --> 55:42.420]  Yeah, it does totally totally it doesn't help with the acronyms and the right exact. That's my point
[55:42.420 --> 55:44.420]  Yeah, okay, um
[55:44.820 --> 55:47.460]  And you weren't doing the homework right when I was doing the homework
[55:48.020 --> 55:51.380]  Well, I mean not the homework for the class but my version of homework
[55:51.780 --> 55:55.620]  Was just you were just getting this theory and looking forward in the emails. Yeah, um
[55:57.140 --> 55:59.140]  Okay, sony hack
[55:59.460 --> 56:06.420]  You see a screenshot on a news story of those links that are in the the thing. You don't talk about
[56:08.900 --> 56:11.460]  You find the email addresses in the zip file
[56:12.500 --> 56:13.540]  um
[56:13.540 --> 56:15.060]  You wonder
[56:15.060 --> 56:19.140]  Maybe if sony systems are so vulnerable or dutch's too. Yeah, uh
[56:19.940 --> 56:21.460]  Sitting outside
[56:21.460 --> 56:24.580]  The starboard manor house on a picnic table or picnic bench
[56:25.140 --> 56:28.180]  And you know, it's like I've said like why would someone waste their time with sony when you could
[56:28.740 --> 56:32.980]  Hack a fucking bank. He's made this a lot quote. I'm interested in joining your gop
[56:33.060 --> 56:37.140]  But I'm afraid my computer skills are self-mortar good best if I can help in any other facility. Please let me know
[56:38.180 --> 56:40.180]  and it uh
[56:40.580 --> 56:42.580]  The hackers add either the email list
[56:42.820 --> 56:44.020]  and
[56:44.020 --> 56:48.980]  A few days passed and you get a link to all these files. You start downloading them
[56:50.020 --> 56:51.700]  I said I could help
[56:51.700 --> 56:53.460]  You said
[56:53.460 --> 56:55.940]  I'm interested in joining your gop
[56:56.020 --> 57:00.740]  But I'm afraid my computer skills are self-mortar good best in joining your gop. I'm interesting
[57:01.300 --> 57:06.500]  It's a typo interested. Yeah, you meant interested. I'm interested in joining your gop. You're joining in
[57:07.220 --> 57:13.540]  In space joining join the word join. Yes, I'm interested in joining your gop
[57:13.780 --> 57:18.900]  But I'm afraid my soft my computer skills are self-mortar good best if I can help in any other facility. Please let me know
[57:18.900 --> 57:20.900]  Wait, that's a severe
[57:22.100 --> 57:25.940]  Mistake joining the word joining. I wasn't trying to join the gop
[57:27.140 --> 57:33.060]  I was interested and something else. Let me autocorrect into joining. There's no way I said I want to join your
[57:33.300 --> 57:38.500]  Let's we let's that's that's interesting. You want to look in your files right now? Yeah, I gotta look at that
[57:38.660 --> 57:40.660]  Well, no, I believe it's there. I just uh
[57:41.220 --> 57:43.220]  I just think if I wrote that
[57:43.700 --> 57:48.180]  I'm interested in enjoying what you're doing is what I remember. That's my instinct
[57:48.900 --> 57:53.140]  No, I mean it's no. I'm interested in joining your gop
[57:53.300 --> 57:57.700]  But I'm afraid my computer skills are soft mark at best if I can help in any other facility
[57:57.780 --> 58:01.060]  Please let me know. I guess I did say that because why would I say my computer skills?
[58:01.060 --> 58:03.060]  Yeah, I just want to get some water
[58:03.300 --> 58:05.780]  Yeah, um, yeah, I guess I did say that
[58:06.900 --> 58:08.900]  um
[58:09.380 --> 58:13.620]  Anyway, you get the while these files are all downloading. This is a few days later now
[58:14.580 --> 58:16.580]  you, uh
[58:17.700 --> 58:19.700]  You suggest
[58:22.660 --> 58:24.660]  I don't know
[58:24.660 --> 58:26.660]  I mean, I don't think so
[58:27.460 --> 58:29.460]  I don't I have no idea
[58:30.420 --> 58:32.420]  Um
[58:33.060 --> 58:35.060]  Um, I mean
[58:35.620 --> 58:38.820]  And then a few days later when these files are all downloading you email them again
[58:39.140 --> 58:42.020]  And you say hey, you guys ever thought about going after Deutsche bank
[58:42.580 --> 58:45.060]  There's tons of evidence on their servers of worldwide fraud
[58:45.060 --> 58:49.300]  Some of them had even contributed to the very sad and tragic suicides of two of their employees. Yes
[58:49.620 --> 58:54.180]  Uh, I knew immediately was maybe that wasn't the best thing I've done at the time
[58:54.260 --> 58:57.940]  But anyway, that's the end of that and then you go through all these files and you're like
[58:58.580 --> 59:00.580]  Posting crazy shit and
[59:01.540 --> 59:02.740]  You
[59:02.740 --> 59:05.380]  aren't really famous, but then you get the letter
[59:06.100 --> 59:07.060]  from
[59:07.060 --> 59:09.060]  Twitter and from sony
[59:09.060 --> 59:14.580]  and then you uh threatening you and you share them with me and uh
[59:16.180 --> 59:19.620]  We wrote a story about this random musician. No one had ever heard of
[59:21.060 --> 59:24.580]  Facing down david boys and sony and twitter
[59:25.460 --> 59:27.220]  and uh
[59:27.300 --> 59:34.340]  And I'm quoting a bit from the fox business exclusive interview, uh, which is wonderful. Um
[59:36.020 --> 59:40.020]  And it and look this is a moment for you because you realize
[59:40.980 --> 59:42.980]  That and this is two things have happened
[59:42.980 --> 59:47.380]  One was your interactions with me about the deutch bank fed letter and then the sony heck and you realize
[59:47.540 --> 59:52.340]  Like there's this ravenous appetite for primary source documents. We can cite big companies
[59:53.220 --> 59:55.860]  feels good to have valuable information and
[59:56.740 --> 01:00:01.140]  And you know what you have more information. Yeah, and charles levin's now enters the picture
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:09.060]  With uh emailing you with some kind of inflammatory theories to get you interested and and uh
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.340]  You know he finds it very quickly finds excuse to come out to camp california to see you
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:21.540]  And I go through that rhythm of role. He says, um
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.420]  Um
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.900]  And you wanted to at this point kind of remake your dad's or help your dad's legacy because um
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.020]  At this point
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.180]  Was your journal article
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.980]  So misguided it's not it because not my corner at the time
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:48.420]  What in reality what had happened is that the coroner in london had done this inquest
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.620]  And the public hearing read a lot of very small snippet of
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:58.340]  The letter from a psychologist that said bill was very anxious about unspecified government investigations
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.980]  And that had led to a handful of news stories, including the washington journal. I know
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.780]  You can imagine from my point of view though. I mean just from a non-journalist point of view
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:13.060]  You see the headline brooksman hangs himself over. I guess I just never really understood. I still understand. Anxiety into lever probe
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.380]  Libor, sorry, lever probe. Um
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.940]  It just it shows like oh, he was guilty somehow. It shows culpability
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:26.180]  I know I get why you don't like it. But yeah, like everyone wrote the same story. I know but you guys broke it
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:30.340]  No, we didn't he didn't you broke the story. It's your journal
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.760]  Uh, you broke that you broke that story in february 2014
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:39.300]  I'm telling you. I like remember that very well and we did not break it
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:46.260]  It was announced at the coroner's office. Anyway, it doesn't matter. No, but the title that that title was your title
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.380]  um
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.380]  So leavenson comes back to california
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.140]  um
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.180]  I mean, we don't need to litigate this. No, I'm not just telling you from my point of view
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:02.340]  How I thought at the time is extremely clear that you want to destroy it. Okay. Um
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:07.940]  You gave uh leaven you as much as it was the institution. I had yourself
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:14.340]  Um, I was the vehicle of destruction. I was like the the bomb that was yes
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.860]  um
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.100]  The unknown saboteur
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.100]  And you were the saboteur. Well, you would be done. Yes the vehicle
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.300]  anyway, okay, so uh
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:34.660]  You share but or you let leavenson poke around in the computer files. Yeah, uh, he finds the stress test stuff
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:40.420]  And he returns to new york and a few months later does the story about the stress tennis
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.580]  But remember we had a deal
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.700]  I didn't just give him this stuff. I we had a deal. He thought yeah, I actually mentioned so you thought
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:54.340]  He was gonna do a big big feature on your day. I thought he gave his word that he would do that a few times
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.060]  um
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.780]  Okay
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.580]  um
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.060]  Uh
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.780]  Okay, let's see
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.340]  Um
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.740]  We have a bunch of stuff that's not of any
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:34.500]  Rowan's to your dad. Okay. Was that Deutsche bank? Yeah, it's just lots and lots of stuff wants to go down to the bank
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.820]  um
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.260]  Uh, and now we're getting a lot of trump stuff
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.300]  Okay, okay, then we fast forward
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.660]  To the bellomar hotel. Okay
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.860]  And you're sitting on the back steps
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.740]  Your laptop's going crazy. So so we're in so hard. It's actually hot to the touch
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.780]  um
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.900]  June 2015
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.860]  Six months earlier, you left strawberry manor. So six months earlier being around the start of the year
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:11.060]  Uh, you left strawberry manor migrated south to LA
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:15.860]  Taking the good ranch and I now know that Peggy did that. Uh, that's not in here because
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.580]  That was our group, right? Um
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:26.180]  This is when you're introduced to larry melzer. Mm-hmm. Good old larry. Good old larry. I love larry. He's a great guy
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.860]  I love larry too. Um, I am a solution focused therapist
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:36.260]  Towards his motto and he calls the patients clients. Um, you told your story to him
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.500]  um
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:47.060]  And we're kind of this is kind of evolving into flashbacks. This is all getting mixed up in our lives here, but um
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.020]  Can you bring the whiskey over here? Sorry, can you grab the whiskey too?
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.020]  Okay
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.180]  Stay out of our shot
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.980]  What?
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.980]  Um, no, I'm okay
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.620]  Um, okay
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.260]  So
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:18.820]  You tell larry that you're on a mission to figure out why your dad killed himself and
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.780]  See
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.780]  He said that back is that better
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.580]  I think it was good actually the way it was. I thought I think it was more. Was it too much? No, no
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.380]  So you told larry that you're on a mission to figure out why your dad killed himself
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:40.020]  But you're being kind of thwarted by your inability to communicate with or get information from your mom
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.700]  Yeah, um, not least the suicide notes and it
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.220]  Then I kind of rewind a little bit and explain
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.100]  Why it is a you're unable this point to communicate with her. Okay. Um
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.500]  And
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:01.220]  You had just like gotten to a point where you both of you could like not control your rage at the other one and
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.980]  And I quote a bunch of emails going back and forth between the two of you
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:11.060]  About you. I mean, frankly like hurling a bit of verbal abuse in her direction and her just being like
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.860]  I see as I see can be
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.660]  back in response and
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.580]  Uh, I mean one in one particularly
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.580]  poignant
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:26.340]  Moment she says I love you and have been paying for you for 30 years
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:29.940]  Which struck me as I thought about more as just
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:34.980]  Really remarkable because when she wrote that it was exactly 30 years
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.420]  And she had rescued you from foster care that she had let you go into
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.580]  and
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:47.140]  And now she's framing that decision 30 years later as I have been paying for you for 30 years. Well, that's what mothers
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:53.620]  That's what parents do. You like it's exactly 30 years. It was exactly 30 years. Yep. I think she was aware of that
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.940]  I mean, she's the one who said for 30 years and it was exactly 30 years
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500]  Uh, and she was framing that decision now
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.180]  Fixing what she had previously told bill was her grave mistake
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.820]  Uh as having imposed a financial burden on herself
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.540]  um
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:14.020]  Uh
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.540]  She when you ask for a personal credit card
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.820]  And accuse her of stealing the money that you were supposed to inherit
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:28.340]  She yells at you dad left you zero. I am the one who loves you. No more complications about any financial matters. You're on your own
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.060]  Uh
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:36.980]  She perceives irresponsibility and laziness on your part. You perceive iciness and deceit on her part
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.740]  You guys like cannot interact at this point and you tell larry
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:47.220]  That you need someone to intermediate for you and larry cheerfully replies that that's what I do. That's my job
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.020]  and uh
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:55.540]  So he gets on the phone top priorities to get some money from her because you've had that one been kicked out of indigo ranch
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.140]  um
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.420]  because you
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.420]  you were accused of verbally abusing
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.900]  a staff member who had unplugged your recording equipment mid-session and
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.420]  um
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.740]  He so so he goes and tries to get money so you can
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.140]  For it somewhere nice or not nice, but somewhere decent to stay so you're not the road way in
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:22.180]  And all his responses. Why won't he get a job and melts her eventually wears him down
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.700]  Get you back on a monthly allowance of $2,500
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:27.620]  um
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.740]  Well
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.140]  Started out a lot less more like $1,500
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:32.820]  Yeah
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.020]  I'm saying eventually
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:41.220]  But it had been $300 which was obviously not a viable way to live anywhere. Certainly not in a major city
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:42.820]  um
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.980]  So you get you move in to
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:49.540]  I mentioned you were at the roadway and you were hooking up with meg and the drug dealer
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:52.100]  And then you then upgrade to the bellomar
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.740]  um
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740]  melts her encourages you
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.180]  to
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:01.620]  Do what you can to figure out what what your arms got
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.340]  And he also shares with you
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:12.020]  His theory about what's going on with a la which is he's gleaned apparently from his few conversations with her and what you've told him
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.740]  And it's that she continues to hold a grudge against her first husband
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.300]  um
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:24.820]  Uh, she's consumed with anger at alexander and shame with herself because she failed as a mother
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.540]  Now she's taking out these emotions on you
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.220]  Uh locking you out of the family in order to safeguard her dignity
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:34.420]  Quote it's about her own social standing her own reputation
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.900]  This is according to melts her
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:37.700]  um
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.260]  This obviously reinforces your impression to what's going on
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.660]  and all these painful memories going all the way back to foster care and
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.460]  uh
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.460]  and
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:54.660]  Let's see. I mean it's also kind of from my perspective a bit of a simplistic theory like it doesn't account for
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:01.380]  All the other like the the fight at this point was two-sided right like you're you were being really rough on her and
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.260]  And she would be listening living in a car
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.220]  Yeah, and she was flying private jets. So yeah, it was a little upset
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.380]  Volved in there to various not quite to that
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.140]  Yeah, dude, I I get like you're both hurt. Yes like from like
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.860]  And she must be feeling really guilty
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.460]  Just a bit for all this stuff built up over decades
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.260]  anyway, um
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.900]  Uh, you had over time been asking ala to share with you
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:39.300]  The suicide notes she refused you assumed she was hiding something and there was
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.860]  You your guess was that it's something to do with what he had written what bill had written to amshu
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.260]  Which is presumably about doi chi bank
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:51.540]  And one of your theories is that doi chi was paying all of it if you quiet about the true reasons for the suicide
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.700]  And I saw was one of your it's your theory. Well
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.900]  No, that's not that's really not my theory
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.780]  Is something that doi chi was paying her off. I didn't think that at first I thought
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.660]  It's possible that leavenson planted that in your head a little bit because there's
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.420]  I have seen that in some of the email traffic. You've also told that to me
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.220]  Like in real time
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.220]  I always thought that was your theory
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.700]  Don't blame me for this. No, I'm not it's not blame
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.940]  It's definitely not my theory. Uh, I mean, I have no idea
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.780]  But I do know meld surgery that that that you might be onto something there
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.940]  So
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:37.540]  You type in so you tried guessing her gmail password that didn't work
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.780]  And so you typed into google a question. How do you hack a gmail account?
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:47.940]  And I've done that search and it sure enough brings back tens of millions of hits very quickly
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.700]  Uh, and so you I walked through how you
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:59.060]  Like learned how to do this and I then then we reached back to where we'd just begun which is that you're sitting on the steps outside the bellom are
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:09.060]  Uh, creating a fake wi-fi spot hot the wi-fi hotspot and watching all the bellomars guests log on and you can see passwords and credit cards and things like that
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.300]  It's a little scary
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.540]  um
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.740]  So
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:20.500]  It's time to try this and you get meld surgery to negotiate stala for 20 grand for a car
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:26.900]  Use snort some heroin go to use car lot and plunk down 20 grand on a silver outie q5 fully loaded
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.500]  Quattro
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:36.660]  Okay, so on father's day you start heading east
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:43.700]  Um, you try to make some money in vegas that does not work so well. That's not what happens to your heroin
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.740]  I run out and I somebody gets dumped on the shag carpet in the hard rock hotel
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.900]  So before going to new york
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:01.140]  You arrange for the reunion with the bandmates in philadelphia. You're supposed to meet goldsboro and pittsburgh
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.940]  um, uh
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:10.580]  You drive for 36 hours straight. Yeah approaching pittsburgh. It's gotta be a new record, too
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.660]  36 hours from vegas to first pretty good. What are you doing?
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.980]  i'm not listening
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.940]  Come come back. I'm coming. Can you listen to this?
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:28.180]  Yeah, so go on. I'm listening. No, I want I want you here for when I'm explaining this because this is
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.620]  A story that you can tell better than I can
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.780]  Okay, oh, so you want me to no, I want you to tell I just want you to be here to help me out. Okay
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.380]  But in the meantime, uh, you're killing me man. You're killing me. You're like
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.100]  What am I doing?
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.140]  No, I'm just trying to understand. I'm just right here
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.180]  Checking the frame. Come on, man. Tucked up
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.300]  You stole that line for me. Now he says chopped up all the time
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.820]  I've been saying chop chop for years. I'm actually not sure we're supposed to say chop chop
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.700]  What's that?
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:12.740]  No chop chop is I kept telling you chop chop david. Come on. Where's the article chop chop? So, okay, it's uh three a.m
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:19.540]  Okay, you're approaching pittsburgh gas station. You realize are did you leave out strawsburgh coming out to yeah?
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:25.700]  I just don't get into that. It's like too complicated. I skip uh hoover dam as well. Okay, um
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:27.060]  I'm
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.060]  pittsburgh
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.220]  Um gas station
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.900]  Why did you think the other motorists were plotting to murder you?
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.100]  um
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.140]  That was delusional
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:45.460]  And obviously, you know very high I hadn't slept for a very long time
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:52.020]  So there was a time I outran it wasn't they were trying to I'd outrun a police officer
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:59.300]  Somewhere outside of in the border of uh, it's west virginia in pennsylvania. Was that the right?
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:06.740]  Anyway, whatever borders pennsylvania and that's where I entered and I had thought that the
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:13.140]  Uh, the police officers had called ahead to search for this for because I crossed the state lines
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.820]  So they couldn't do anything in that one state so they had to call their friends the other state
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.820]  And since it's like one town next to each other, it's not a jurisdiction. I'm sure
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.540]  That stopped the police officers from
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.740]  Uh, Tennessee or the fuck I was going to pennsylvania
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:31.780]  So I thought they called their friends and the precinct ahead of me to look for my car and catch me
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.860]  If they could
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:38.900]  so um, and as the delusions were this is getting more and more severe, I thought that uh
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.420]  I was being followed by off-duty police officers
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:47.300]  And they're just waiting to catch me to pull me over if you're doing something because they couldn't pull me over for outrunning a cop
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.940]  On some other state line because I cop had no jurisdiction
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:54.900]  But if they caught me speeding or doing anything else, they had all the right to pull me over and then
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.700]  Arrest me. So I was trying very carefully to follow all the rules and be very safe
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:03.780]  And I had uh, wait, but then you arrive at the gas station. What happens?
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:09.140]  Wait, but this is before the gas station, right? But then you get to the gas station because I love the gas station
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:14.980]  Yeah, I needed to get gas. Um, and so I told you about where before they got I pulled off to the gas station
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.740]  and
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.100]  um
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.100]  There was it was in the first one was empty
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.380]  There was no it was closed and so
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:30.580]  I tried to get back onto the ramp onto the highway and these cars came out of nowhere and got in front of me onto the
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.860]  Onto the ramp and it put on its brake lights
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.780]  And it was a truck and it had a sign on the backs of caution
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:45.060]  And it was just a normal caution sign that a truck would have but I read that as the truck was telling me to be careful
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:50.340]  And I was like like the driver of the truck was like you have to be careful because we're gonna we're gonna get you
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.340]  I was like, oh no
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.740]  so I managed to get back on the highway and find a
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.700]  Well at gas station
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:03.540]  And then when I got to the gas station, we really took over it was so I got so crazy. It's so scary
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.540]  I was really scared for my life. I thought these people were gonna
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:12.420]  Are gonna beat the shit out of me because like redneck fill in the middle of nowhere and
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.180]  Like they were conspiring and to murder me for outrunning one of their friends
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:23.860]  Or it was just this got built up in my head and I couldn't you know, I thought I someone had slipped me up acid
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.140]  I I remember going to the gap to the mcdonald's for coffee
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:31.140]  And I'm thinking is there lsd in this coffee like what the fuck this can't be normal
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:37.860]  And at some point I lost the fact that this was either me or lsd or something else that had drifted off
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.540]  into
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.660]  into
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:46.100]  Memory and what took over and my consciousness was that I was in this terribly dangerous situation
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.540]  And um, and how are we gonna get people's attention to help you?
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.580]  I was gonna get people's attention by the same the car and fire
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:58.020]  Is my recollection of what you told me is that you were going to ram the car into the gas pumps?
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:03.860]  No, but no, I was gonna no, I was gonna set the car and fire reporting gas all over the car
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.260]  So the way goldsboro
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.860]  Tells this to me is that he's on the gray hand in the middle of the night
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:15.140]  But the reason I had good reasoning in my delusion. I had good reasoning. How's that is that rather than be
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:20.900]  Murdered by these redneck cops and their friends. I would be going put into a proper jail
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:26.740]  with real police if I had created a huge scene of some kind and then they could I could not be ignored
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.420]  and then I could not be rather than being uh
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.780]  Wister it whisked away in some room and murdered
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:39.940]  That that would have a huge noise that people that are outside of the gas station would call the police and the people inside the gas station
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:45.540]  Would call the police or into strangers that were coming in to get gas would call the police and arrest me officially
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.100]  So you were witnesses, you know
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:55.700]  So you were in fashion. I wasn't it was very bad. Yes very bad. Okay. I was so scared
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.420]  So I mean it was like
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:04.900]  It sounds terrifying. It was terrifying. I'm laughing now, but it's it's funny in retrospect, but it wasn't funny at the time
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:06.900]  Yeah, it doesn't sound funny
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:11.060]  Okay, so you eventually make it to new york you re up on harrowing
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:16.340]  Uh, I was didn't want anyone hurt. So I was waiting for the like the proper time when it would be
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:18.500]  You know, there would be no people that would be
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.620]  You know caught in this explosion or the fire
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.860]  So I was like waiting, you know, I didn't know what to do and I couldn't believe I'm sitting in the car
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:32.980]  Like I can't believe I have to set the gas station on fire. I can't believe I have to do this. Okay. Let's keep going. It's terrible
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:37.620]  Well, no, I mean, it's no, I love it. I've got it. Is this how you wrote it? Yeah
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:44.340]  Yeah, more or less my recollection in gold's rose recollection is that you were planning to ram the car into a gas pump to cause an explosion
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.500]  No, I was it was decided on fire
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.820]  I mean because he's running into the it wouldn't cause an explosion is to have a car hit gas pump
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.260]  I mean, you have to actually set it on fire. So I don't know why he would say that
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.060]  Um, it doesn't make sense. But none of it
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:03.700]  No, no, no, that is not the that's yeah, it doesn't it doesn't make sense without that also, uh,
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:10.740]  It's terrible and I never I mean you heard stories of people going into these drug fuel delusions
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.820]  I didn't know I thought they were just sort of like exaggerating. I didn't know it was a real thing
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:19.460]  And you're losing control of your mind. That's a scary scary place to be. Yeah, it was scary
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:25.780]  But in my head, I didn't know it was in control till afterwards which makes it even scary. Yeah, right? Like it's one thing
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.580]  It's insane. Yeah
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.540]  Um, I was insane for that time. It was terrible
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:39.860]  Anyway, sorry. No, this is interesting. This is kind of a more depth to the story than I previously heard actually so
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.900]  Okay, so fast forward a couple weeks you re-up the supply of heroin drive to new york
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:51.460]  And you arrive at the apartment your mom's apartment building. It's your first time there since the moral
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.020]  Uh
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.020]  doorman lets you in
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.580]  And you ride the elevator up to the 15th floor
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:04.340]  Knock on the door your mom looks through the people you have to keep in mind. I didn't sleep for nearly a week
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.860]  I mean the 36 hours is this this is we're back to no it's back
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:13.460]  Yeah, getting to that point of that insanity that I was in I didn't sleep because I had detox myself
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:19.540]  Uh into hoover dam. I still could not sleep. It was terrible. It was hard to yourself at about the hard rock
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:25.380]  I would say five days or less. Yeah hard rock hotel of no sleep and then a lot of amphetamine
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.420]  and riddle in that the sub buttex
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:31.860]  A lot of it with no sleep and driving. Yeah, so it was
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.500]  Yeah, that'll do for disaster
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:40.260]  I mean, you're honestly lucky you didn't crash and really get hurt. Yeah, I mean, I know I'm a terrible driver too
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:45.620]  I don't know how that I just get that luck man. Luck not skill at high speeds. I'm a good driver
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.860]  Remind me never get me
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.660]  Um, okay, okay
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:55.540]  Up you go in the apartment building to the 15th floor
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.340]  She won't let you in
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:04.020]  This is all going according to the plan you sit down the carpeted hallway floor with your laptop and lay your trap
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.780]  And then you call the police. Yeah, police arrive
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.900]  Um, that gets your mom to open the door
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.940]  she uh
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.020]  The carpeted floor
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:22.980]  It's carpeted in the hallway. Yeah. No, it's not there was a rug a throw rug in sound card. Okay. Um
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.940]  Um
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.340]  So cops come
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:33.540]  Uh
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.860]  She says she's someone over if you can't see me now
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.780]  Uh, or I can't see you now and the cops say
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.500]  You can go get a judicial order the next day, but there's nothing they can do
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:48.180]  But at this point your trap has worked the
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:52.580]  Your laptop is intercepted a bunch of data from her phone or computer
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:55.620]  And off you go down to the lower east side
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.580]  park the car on orchard street
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.180]  There you're sitting in the car air conditioning running
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.900]  Um
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:14.580]  And if you start looking through all the packets then your packet sniffer or whatever it's called the wire sharp
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:19.140]  What is it wire sharp wire? Sure. Okay, and
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.260]  Lo and behold
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:27.380]  You find what looks like an email or a password to the gmail account
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.540]  You get a gmail type in the credentials
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:36.500]  Hold your breath. I should de-hash it. There's more process, but it's more elaborate than that. But yes
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.140]  Well, but ultimately you go to the gmail account and you type in
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:43.780]  Her username and then the password that you've deciphered and it
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:46.580]  Uh
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:48.260]  And you're in
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:50.260]  first step
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.260]  Some more to stay
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.780]  And you book yourself in to university club
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.260]  With her credentials that are in her email
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:02.260]  So I didn't want to waste time looking for a credit card number because there's so many emails
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:07.860]  I don't know how to search through this app. So I figured this is the first thing I saw was the university club's a guess
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.500]  It's easy to get to. Yep. Yeah
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:11.620]  um
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.660]  It
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:17.380]  Because I figured I could just go find credit card numbers once I had a place to stay why waste time doing the car
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.020]  um, okay, so
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.060]  um
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.380]  You get there
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.620]  You buy some cigars since they don't have cigarettes
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.740]  Um, right?
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.740]  Wait, sorry to say again. I you get there. You buy some cigars and live cigarettes. They don't have cigarettes
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:41.540]  I smoke these ridiculous cigars. I parked the car in there in their parking lot
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:46.740]  That's right. It's disgusting. It's smoking cigars. That's cigarettes. They can handle it
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.540]  um
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:53.860]  Okay, so you start going through the emails and what do you see you see
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.260]  all sorts of
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:25:01.380]  Signs of them your mom and sisters returning to normal life traveling gossiping
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.860]  going out to dinner
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.860]  Doing all sorts of stuff that's not including you
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.740]  Um, which has got to hurt
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.100]  You find the wills
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.420]  Um, you find what looks to you like evidence that your mom gave
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:22.900]  Oh, I had the wills before but I found other wills. Yeah
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.780]  And that you find what you think is evidence that your mom gave
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:32.580]  Lots of money to your sisters. Yeah, not to you. Yeah, um
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:35.540]  5 million in total
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.940]  um
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.860]  Okay, so you're in a lot of pain
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:47.140]  I'm not going through all of this right now because it's just it's too much
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.300]  Um
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:54.420]  So still the university club you go back in and you search for two words notes bill
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.980]  And very quickly you find a pdf
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.260]  File you open it in there the suicide notes
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.780]  And you go to the bathroom
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:09.540]  And you open the window and you sit in the toilet and you start reading
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:13.140]  And
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:15.140]  I mean
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:17.140]  I don't know you want to just
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.620]  Tell me how you feel or do you want me to go through this?
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:23.300]  Well, I mean, it's how you wrote it. That's what's important
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:30.100]  It's like it's more interesting here what you how you wrote the incident with the gas station than hearing me say
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:33.940]  That's a fact, David
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:35.060]  So, I mean
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.060]  Sure, so how did you write it?
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:41.940]  Um, so first up your mom's letter. Okay, uh, you would the last you had heard
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.940]  Was from bob at the funeral because that was a beautiful love letter
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:52.900]  And this is not a beautiful love letter. It's page after page after page of insecurity anger
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.620]  paranoia
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:58.180]  How he's an alcoholic he even mentions Deutsche Bank
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.540]  And the role there and how it you know
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.260]  Why that role was not satisfied?
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.860]  And it you're meanwhile the room is being filled with smoke
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:14.500]  Your word is going to go into the hallway. You turn on the hot water. So now it's all steamy and smoky and disgusting
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:18.820]  And one by one you read these notes. Um
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:24.900]  There's Alessa and kushkas. There's the one to build mother

[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:57.780]  It doesn't make sense why it says his he apologized for being careless. What does that mean? How would he betray it onto his trust?

[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.380]  Okay
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:09.700]  So

[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.940]  Why did he feel why did he blame himself for all this?
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:24.660]  Let me just pause there. Okay, what do we have a plan for meet him? Yeah, I was checking to see if it does
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:27.620]  Are refined it's finger seven o'clock
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.340]  So let me just say I think it is a good song

[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.900]  It's not because it's not because of anything bad or like the alarming
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:11.060]  Because this is a pretty good stopping point if we're about to go to dinner in a few minutes. Yeah, I think I think we've done a lot
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.700]  Yeah
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.860]  I think it was a good time to stop. Okay
