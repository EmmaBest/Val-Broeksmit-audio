0	4520	I think the position should be pretty good, right?
4520	5520	Yeah.
5520	9640	You want your full body, no?
9640	10640	Yeah.
10640	11640	In the shot.
11640	12640	Me or Val?
12640	13640	Everybody.
13640	15240	Well, what part of me is in the shot now?
15240	19000	Well, it's just, I mean, maybe you could just a little bit on there.
19000	20000	Where's your, where's...
20000	21000	Yeah, like this.
21000	22000	Okay.
22000	23000	Yeah, so where's his free man, so he doesn't...
23000	27040	Yeah, I thought it was right around here, because keep in mind it goes, once you actually
27040	29080	hit play, hit record.
29080	30080	It's going to go over more.
30080	31080	It's not over CC.
31080	32080	Oh, yeah, because this is...
32080	33080	Yeah, you've got room.
33080	34080	No, sorry.
34080	35080	Is this okay right now?
35080	36080	Yeah, that's great.
36080	37080	Okay, great.
37080	38080	Okay.
38080	39080	Oh, Kida.
39080	40080	So, we are...
40080	54880	We are in the early days of them at Deutsche Bank, and so Edson is, as I've said, and as
54880	63080	you know, just like, he's unbridled id, and that's like, that's what he is.
63080	65600	He's like a big bundle of id.
65600	66600	And Bill...
66600	69080	A bit of ego.
69080	71360	Bill is more the super ego, right?
71360	75880	He's the one who is reserved, he kind of restrains the...
75880	77880	He's a practical one.
77880	84800	He's practical, he's conservative, and he's just like down to earth.
85480	92600	Sometimes in ways that people make fun of him for, like he takes the tube to work, which
92600	96360	is crazy, because these guys do not take the tube, and they take the tube.
96360	97360	No, he loves the tube.
97360	98360	Yeah, he loves the tube.
98360	99360	Loves the subway.
99360	100360	He loves trains.
100360	101360	Loves trains.
101360	106000	I like trains, too.
106000	107000	So one of...
107000	111800	Bill was kind of running a business, but he had a co-head of the business, a guy named
111800	112800	Martin Loat.
112800	113800	Loat?
114800	118800	He was a retired British military officer.
118800	121800	What's he a military officer?
121800	123080	He was in...
123080	126480	The rumor was that, which wasn't true, is that he was a Special Forces officer, but he's
126480	127480	just...
127480	128480	He's not.
128480	129480	He was in the military.
129480	131480	Like, doing life in the military.
131480	136480	I think he was in the army, I'm not quite sure what he was doing.
136480	141520	It doesn't really matter, for these purposes.
141600	148480	So, sorry, Bill took Martin under his wing a bit, and kind of trained him on...
148480	150120	Especially when it came to ethical things.
150120	151120	So he...
151120	154760	He trained Martin on that, yes.
154760	157760	And it...
157760	160640	So Martin always looked up to him.
160640	165800	Bill's mantra, which he'd always repeat, was, let's get down to first principles.
165800	166800	First principles.
166800	171040	Yeah, so he would, you know, let's cut to the chase.
171080	175480	Let's look at things from boiling down to their essence.
175480	178120	He...
178120	180320	When there was a problem, he would be dispatched to clean it up.
180320	181800	There's a financial crisis in Asia.
181800	185080	Bill's immediately on the flight to Hong Kong.
185080	189320	He reminded some of his colleagues of the wolf character in Pulp Fiction.
189320	191440	Oh, yeah, the fixer, sure.
191440	195520	Yeah, the fixer.
195520	196520	Some colleagues...
196520	200880	Yeah, and one of the good things about his restraining influence
200880	206840	on Edson is that, you know, he calmed people when times were too good, and he made people
206840	209840	kind of just be a little more restrained.
209840	214480	Some people, some of his colleagues told me, a number of his colleagues told me, that they
214480	217000	wondered if maybe he was depressed.
217000	218000	That was...
218000	219000	Well, because he was...
219000	220640	He dampened everything.
220640	221640	It was like...
221640	222640	But if it was...
222640	227160	Yeah, if everyone was, you know, extremely joyful, he said, we'll come back down to Earth
227160	228160	and let's...
228160	230840	I think what you guys described it to me is that he managed to drain the emotions from
230840	231840	everything.
231840	232840	No, but he was...
232840	233840	Everyone was too depressed.
233840	234840	Let's not argue about this.
234840	235840	I'm just saying this with people with his colleagues' perception.
235840	239080	Okay, but let me give you the opposing viewpoint.
239080	243120	If someone was way too happy and joyful, it would say, you know, calm down a bit, let's
243120	247440	focus on what's needed to be done, you're over, you know, exaggerating with a lot of
247440	250760	this joy when you need to focus on the reality of the matter.
250760	255040	If someone was too low or depressed, you would say, you're focusing too much on this misery
255040	257160	instead of the practicality of it.
257160	259920	There's no need for this depression if you think things through.
259920	262920	Just like there's no need for this excess joy because there's something always looming
262920	263920	in the background.
263920	264920	Be prepared for everything.
264920	265920	I completely understand what you're saying.
265920	269960	And that can be misinterpreted as depression, depending on who he's talking to.
269960	274520	If he's talking to someone that's really happy and my dad comes in and says he wants to burst
274520	276880	their bubble, they're going to say how he was depressed.
276880	279000	Don't be so defensive about the kinds of depression.
279000	280000	I'm not...
280000	281000	I certainly...
281000	285960	I just wanted to make it clear that that is very, very much dependent on one's perception
285960	287400	and the situation all as well.
287400	290960	So if someone's to say he's depressed because he bursted my bubble...
290960	294160	As you'll see as we go through this, there are a lot of people who at various points
294160	295160	wonder if Bill is depressed.
295160	296160	Okay, but that's why I'm just...
296160	302080	I know you're making the case for this depression and I'm just making the case against him.
302080	303480	I'm not making the case for depression.
303480	309600	I'm saying accurately, obviously, that that is the way a number of colleagues told me
309600	310600	that that is what they...
310600	311920	They didn't say he was depressed.
311920	314760	They're saying they wondered if maybe he was depressed.
314760	315760	That was how they perceived it.
315760	317200	And during what points in time?
317200	318200	I mean, this was...
318200	319200	Throughout...
319200	320200	Yeah, I mean at different points in time.
320200	324400	So this point that I'm talking about right now is in around 97.
324400	325400	Okay.
325400	326400	So this is shortly after...
326400	329400	This is a year or so after he's joined the Beck.
329400	330400	Okay.
330400	332400	And maybe two years after he's joined the Beck.
332400	335400	After he's joined Deutsche.
335400	340120	Okay, so let's see.
340120	343560	Edson started his affair with Estelle.
343560	344560	Yes, Estelle.
344560	348840	Which is a wonderful story, but let's not even go there right now.
348840	349840	But you've included the story.
349840	350840	Oh, yeah.
350840	351840	Okay.
351840	354560	Oh, and Estelle becomes like a fairly significant character.
354560	355560	Does she?
355560	356560	Going for it.
356560	357560	Yeah, okay.
357560	358560	Did you talk to her?
358560	364560	I'm not going to get into who I talked to and who I didn't talk to.
364560	365560	Okay.
366560	376560	Okay, so Deutsche Bank does in the late night, in 98, it buys Banker's Trust.
376560	377560	Yes.
377560	378560	Which is...
378560	381560	It turns out to be a real disaster of...
381560	383560	That's kind of one of the original sins for Deutsche Bank.
383560	385560	It was buying up Banker's Trust.
385560	386560	I mean, it's a horrible deal.
386560	387560	And it's a terrible deal.
387560	388560	They're doing it.
388560	390560	For buying it up and turning it into DVTCA?
390560	392560	Well, it became...
392560	396560	It kind of became a large number that became DVTCA.
396560	402560	This is like the kind of real point at which Deutsche Bank went from being a European-centered
402560	404560	investment bank into an American investment bank.
404560	409560	Or becoming a European bank, a German bank into a global bank.
409560	410560	You could argue that.
410560	411560	Well, it was already...
411560	413560	At that point, it was very big in London already.
413560	416560	It was asleep, as people describe it, a sleepy bank.
416560	418560	I think that was actually Landon.
418560	419560	Landon Thomas.
419560	423560	Sorry to hear about your...
423560	425560	No, I'm not being a dick.
425560	428560	It's just that Landon described it as a sleepy little bank at the time.
428560	429560	And he was right.
429560	433560	And then when my dad and I came along, I turned into a bad myth.
433560	434560	Right.
434560	435560	But what I'm saying...
435560	437560	And buying DVTCA was part of that expansion.
437560	438560	No, no, no, no.
438560	439560	DVTCA, they didn't buy DVTCA.
439560	443560	I mean, buying Banker's Trust and becoming DVTCA was part of that expansion.
443560	445560	Banker's Trust didn't become DVTCA.
445560	447560	Like, Banker's Trust is a...
447560	449560	It's an early version of DVTCA.
449560	450560	Okay, let's just move on.
450560	451560	It doesn't matter.
451560	452560	It matters.
452560	453560	It matters.
453560	454560	I'm just wanting...
454560	456560	Because this is a fact check, is it not?
456560	460560	Yeah, but this is a fact check that we're doing of you and your father.
460560	461560	Okay, fine.
461560	464560	You're just going to need to trust me that I'm this kind of stuff in particular.
464560	465560	Okay.
465560	468560	I have done a lot of research before.
468560	471560	Okay, I believe you.
471560	474560	So, let's see.
474560	478560	Okay, then we'll get into a bunch of Trump shit, which I'm not going to get into with you right now.
478560	479560	Just purely for...
479560	480560	Any background?
480560	484560	Yeah, it's like the story of how Deutsche Bank got into Trump.
484560	485560	Okay.
485560	486560	And...
486560	487560	Do you know...
487560	489560	Do you name names here?
489560	490560	Yeah.
490560	491560	Okay.
491560	493560	Is this going to be breaking?
493560	495560	Some of this has been told previously.
495560	496560	Okay.
498560	501560	Did you get off on the guys to sign the loans?
501560	502560	What was that?
502560	505560	Did you write down the guys to sign the loans?
505560	507560	I think I saw that yesterday.
507560	509560	This is about the people who started the relationship with Trump.
509560	510560	Okay.
519560	522560	What conclusions did you come to?
522560	523560	Nothing.
523560	524560	Oh, come on.
524560	525560	There's no...
525560	526560	There's...
526560	527560	No, it's not even that.
527560	529560	No, don't turn it off.
529560	530560	There's not...
531560	532560	What?
536560	539560	Nothing groundbreaking or nothing...
539560	540560	There's interesting stuff.
540560	541560	I can get into that right now.
541560	542560	Okay.
542560	543560	There's...
543560	545560	Any connections to Justice Kennedy?
545560	547560	Nothing good.
549560	552560	I feel like I'm the reporter and you're the source.
552560	556560	Can you confirm or deny Justice Kennedy's involvement in the Sun?
556560	557560	No?
557560	558560	Well, Justice...
559560	560560	Yeah.
562560	563560	Okay.
563560	564560	I'll let it go.
564560	565560	Okay.
565560	570560	Okay, so in 2000, Bill retires for a second time.
570560	571560	Okay.
571560	576560	And he felt simultaneously overwhelmed and bored.
576560	577560	Mm-hmm.
577560	579560	And he also felt like he was neglecting his daughters.
579560	580560	Mm-hmm.
580560	581560	And maybe he's burning it.
581560	583560	So in August 2000, he decides to retire for the second time.
583560	585560	Edson tried to keep him.
586560	591560	The bill kind of equivocated a little bit and then decided he needed to get out.
591560	592560	Mm-hmm.
592560	594560	He was going to withdraw over several months.
594560	596560	He's going to spend time with his family and still be in Shakespeare,
596560	598560	involved in their soup kitchen.
598560	601560	And the...
602560	603560	What did you get?
603560	609560	He said to someone that it was hard to do a job and we've done it,
609560	613560	which didn't really run true, because the job was definitely not done.
613560	614560	And once again...
614560	615560	Which job?
615560	620560	Well, they're building Deutsche Bank into a modern institution,
620560	624560	and that was definitely not a finished thing.
624560	625560	By 2000?
625560	626560	No.
626560	628560	I mean, that wasn't finished for years.
628560	629560	Okay.
629560	630560	It still isn't finished.
630560	634560	Well, I mean, it became from small to big.
634560	636560	I think that's what he's referring to.
636560	639560	Taking small banks is making it to big global bank.
639560	640560	Right?
640560	643560	What I'm saying is that to the people he used those words with,
643560	644560	it did not run true.
644560	645560	It did not run true.
645560	646560	Okay.
646560	648560	And I'm also saying that to some of his colleagues,
648560	651560	the fact that these retirements were becoming a pattern,
651560	654560	suggested to them that he was having some trouble covering with the pressure,
654560	656560	and that there was a certain fragility there.
656560	657560	Okay.
657560	659560	And again, that's not...
659560	662560	That's simply the way they perceived it.
662560	663560	Sure.
663560	664560	Okay.
664560	665560	Edson...
665560	670560	Edson is kind of...
670560	675560	He's with Estelle and is, you know, losing.
675560	682560	Bill's gone, and that check on him and Super Ego is gone,
682560	685560	and he's spinning a little bit of control.
685560	686560	Edson.
686560	687560	Yeah.
687560	688560	And that, you guys.
688560	689560	Yeah.
690560	695560	And I'm recounting the scene that you encountered
695560	697560	in the Park Avenue apartment.
697560	698560	Yeah.
698560	701560	You could hear Sinead O'Connor,
701560	706560	which was weird because you got a hater Sinead O'Connor.
706560	707560	Yeah.
707560	710560	And you went in and sat down with them, and he was crying,
710560	712560	and the song was on repeat,
712560	714560	and he said, Dad, you okay?
714560	717560	And he said, Not really, but I will be.
717560	718560	That sound about right?
718560	719560	Yeah.
721560	723560	I sat with them for a while.
723560	724560	Yeah.
724560	726560	You go over the whole thing.
726560	727560	Okay.
727560	731560	So Bill says he will be okay.
731560	733560	Deutsche Bank is not going to be okay because this is the moment
733560	735560	where everything starts to fall apart.
735560	737560	Bill's gone, Edson's dead,
737560	742560	and a huge power struggle breaks out to fill with those voids.
742560	747560	And this is where Anshu starts to really gain power and climb.
747560	751560	And Anshu, as you know, is very ambitious.
751560	755560	And, okay, so we're going to skip a bunch of stuff right now
755560	758560	because it's just like, there's no, actually no or not.
758560	759560	We're coming right back to you.
759560	761560	We're coming right back to you right here.
761560	763560	Did you do any parallels with what's going on at Merrill Lynch
763560	764560	at the time?
764560	765560	Not really.
765560	771560	I mean, if we get into a bit later, like, that your dad was doing
771560	772560	some consulting.
772560	774560	I didn't really feel like he was being listened to by Stan O'Neill
774560	775560	and down here.
775560	776560	Okay.
776560	780560	And that Stan O'Neill was trying to get him to take a bigger job,
780560	783560	and your dad said, no, no, no, no, no, I just wouldn't do it.
783560	786560	And any warnings about the coming crisis?
786560	790560	There's, well, you know, I'm not actually getting into this
790560	791560	in the book.
791560	792560	Okay.
792560	795560	But your dad actually, this is one of the things,
795560	798560	there's a few things toward the end of his life, especially,
798560	800560	that he got wrong quite badly.
800560	801560	Yeah.
801560	803560	And the financial crisis is one of them.
803560	804560	He's one of them.
804560	806560	He really underestimated, there are these emails between him
806560	811560	and McKaylee, where they're kind of talking about how bad the crisis
811560	812560	is about to be.
812560	814560	And your dad, again, I'm not getting into this in the book,
814560	817560	because it's not that relevant, but he did misread it.
817560	819560	And again, it's like a misreading that a lot of people had,
819560	822560	but he predicted, he made very specific predictions about how
822560	824560	things were going to play out and how bad they were going to be.
824560	828560	And he was wrong.
828560	836560	But again, the, okay, we're talking about some of the,
836560	839560	so you graduate from college, you moved to New York,
839560	842560	you were taking classes at NYU, we were talking about this yesterday.
842560	846560	You're not going to like this.
846560	850560	I'm noting that a number, in fact, I'm saying many of Bill's
850560	852560	colleagues knew that he had two daughters,
852560	855560	but didn't realize he had a son.
855560	858560	I'm also noting that you actually had a slightly warmer relationship
858560	862560	with Bill than you did with your mom, who, like,
862560	866560	struck some of your friends and some of the family's friends
866560	870560	as just very icy.
870560	876560	And whereas Bill was really trying to understand your rebelliousness
876560	878560	and tried to get to know you.
878560	884560	And actually say that you told friends at the time that you felt
884560	889560	like you had been a burden to your mom ever since she fled Ukraine
889560	892560	and why else would she have let you be dumped and fostered here.
892560	895560	That's a direct quote from Matt Goldsboro.
895560	899560	Did you say that?
899560	901560	Okay, so you bounce around.
901560	904560	I don't remember saying that, but it's possible.
904560	908560	Does that sound like an accurate encapsulation of your feelings?
908560	913560	I'm sure at the time, maybe, yeah.
913560	917560	Okay, so we're going back and I'm talking about some of the jobs
917560	919560	you haven't mentioned, kitchen nightmares.
919560	922560	What was the thing you told me about yesterday that I didn't realize?
922560	925560	Oh, there's the website thing.
925560	926560	Michael Luton.
926560	928560	Yeah, I had no idea about that.
928560	930560	Big.com, Michael Luton.
930560	933560	There's a bunch of websites.
933560	939560	But I know that your main passion and obsession and love is music.
939560	943560	And there's Good Time Charlie's, which became Bikini Robot Army.
943560	948560	And the band was basically you and whoever you were jamming with at that moment.
948560	952560	Describing you, he was a talented musician and songwriter
952560	955560	tapping this deep well of painful memories for inspiration.
955560	960560	The result was mournful, angry, beautiful guitar piano ballads like Hey Mama,
960560	961560	in 2002.
961560	964560	And then we've got Hey Mama.
964560	967560	Have you listened to Hey Mama?
967560	969560	Hey Mama's a really nice song.
969560	970560	Thank you.
970560	971560	Your music's really good.
971560	974560	I actually, like, not look a smug of your ass.
974560	975560	Oh, thank you.
975560	978560	There's enough fucking smoke in this room anyway.
978560	980560	Okay, we meet...
980560	981560	It's fake.
981560	982560	It's vapor.
982560	983560	It's not smoking in mine.
983560	988560	There's literally, like, he's...
988560	989560	No, it's fine.
989560	991560	Keep David from sleeping.
991560	993560	It's fine.
993560	995560	Yeah, exactly.
995560	996560	It's like coffee.
996560	998560	Right, the coffee.
998560	999560	Oh, good.
999560	1001560	Yeah, I need some more of that, too.
1001560	1002560	Oh, thank you.
1002560	1003560	Let's see.
1003560	1004560	Here you go.
1006560	1007560	Thank you.
1007560	1009560	Oh, this is, like, real serious.
1009560	1010560	Sweetheart.
1010560	1011560	Let's see.
1014560	1015560	Muah.
1015560	1016560	Muah.
1017560	1018560	Let's see.
1019560	1020560	Okay.
1023560	1026560	So, Joe Ackerman, we meet.
1026560	1028560	Oh, Ackerman is the character.
1028560	1029560	Yeah.
1032560	1034560	And I'm not going to bore you with all of this.
1034560	1035560	In fact, this section...
1035560	1036560	What is important?
1036560	1038560	Because you go to the bank of Cyprus.
1038560	1039560	Yeah, I know it's important.
1039560	1043560	Val, just in the interest of time here, like, there's...
1043560	1046560	He's a very important character in the book.
1047560	1048560	But it's just not...
1048560	1050560	There's no point in fact checking that with you, because...
1050560	1052560	In Colin?
1052560	1053560	Colin Fan?
1053560	1054560	Yeah.
1054560	1055560	He's in there, so...
1055560	1056560	He's in there, too.
1057560	1059560	We talked to...
1060560	1061560	Fuck, what's his name?
1061560	1063560	Sabah, capital guy.
1063560	1064560	The camera was in there.
1064560	1065560	Boas, wine soup?
1065560	1066560	Boas, yeah.
1066560	1067560	We talked to him?
1067560	1068560	Nothing.
1068560	1069560	We've talked to him.
1069560	1070560	Okay.
1070560	1072560	Because there's an interesting relationship
1072560	1074560	between Boas and Colin.
1074560	1075560	Colin Fan.
1075560	1076560	Yeah.
1076560	1077560	Yeah, you've mentioned that.
1077560	1078560	Yeah.
1078560	1080560	There's an interesting relationship between Boas
1080560	1081560	and a lot of people.
1081560	1082560	Boas is...
1082560	1083560	My dad really likes him.
1083560	1084560	I know he does.
1084560	1085560	Yeah.
1085560	1086560	You've mentioned that.
1088560	1089560	Oh, Kydoke.
1090560	1091560	Kydoke?
1092560	1097560	So I note here at the end of chapter 10
1097560	1103560	that this is the late odds.
1104560	1105560	The late...
1105560	1106560	Or not the late odds.
1106560	1107560	It's like the mid odds.
1107560	1108560	Okay.
1108560	1110560	And this is like a go-go period for the bank.
1110560	1111560	And it's actually...
1111560	1113560	They don't realize it, but it's spinning out of control.
1113560	1118560	And the bank desperately needed someone to be there
1118560	1121560	to say no, and wasn't afraid to give unwanted news.
1121560	1122560	Someone like Bill.
1122560	1123560	Okay.
1123560	1124560	But Bill wasn't there.
1124560	1126560	In fact, Bill was...
1126560	1128560	In the months after the Edson died,
1128560	1131560	had been very glad that he no longer worked in the bank.
1131560	1138560	He told friends that he just realized that he even came to kind of
1138560	1143560	view Edson's death as a result of the banking industry in some ways.
1143560	1148560	Like if he hadn't been so competitive and profit hungry,
1148560	1149560	maybe Edson wouldn't have died.
1149560	1152560	If Edson hadn't been so profit hungry.
1157560	1160560	Well, I mean, the way I've got it here is that
1160560	1163560	like the endless hours, the cutthroat environment, the dubious ethics,
1163560	1166560	these things hadn't caused Edson's plane to go down.
1166560	1168560	But in some ways, if he squinted hard enough,
1168560	1169560	perhaps they'd contributed to it.
1169560	1171560	Maybe he hadn't worked so hard.
1171560	1173560	Maybe he hadn't worked as hard as his wife would have stayed in London.
1173560	1175560	And Edson wouldn't have boarded that fateful flight to Rangeley.
1175560	1177560	Maybe he wouldn't have owned his own plane.
1177560	1179560	Maybe he would have enforced a flight commercial.
1179560	1180560	Or maybe not.
1180560	1181560	I like the squinting.
1181560	1182560	That's good.
1182560	1183560	Yeah.
1183560	1184560	But Bill told acquaint...
1184560	1187560	Ladies and gentlemen, that is why David is the writer.
1187560	1188560	You see?
1188560	1190560	If you squint it, maybe you can see this.
1190560	1191560	That's good.
1191560	1193560	And I'm not blowing smoke up your ass.
1193560	1194560	Good.
1194560	1197560	Come sit down so people can see your beautiful bald head.
1197560	1198560	Yeah.
1198560	1199560	So let me just do this right here.
1199560	1200560	Off camera first.
1204560	1205560	Yes.
1205560	1206560	So I'll just keep going.
1206560	1207560	Okay, please go ahead.
1207560	1210560	So Bill, obviously not in banking anymore.
1210560	1212560	Immediate priority is to help Estelle,
1212560	1215560	who is, you know, not only heartbroken,
1215560	1218560	but also ostracized by everyone because, you know,
1218560	1220560	she was the mistress.
1220560	1226560	And so he, Bill, gave her some spending money,
1226560	1229560	kept her busy doing odd jobs,
1229560	1233560	had her fixing up the flat after it caught on fire.
1233560	1234560	Fire.
1234560	1238560	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1238560	1244560	Just some fond anecdotes about Bill that I think you already know.
1244560	1249560	About how, like, you know, he could be a penny pincher sometimes,
1249560	1252560	but he was generous when it mattered.
1252560	1253560	But he was a penny pincher.
1253560	1254560	Yeah.
1254560	1255560	But he also, like, I'm kind of...
1255560	1257560	Stop using all those paper towels.
1257560	1259560	You only need one sheet of paper towel.
1259560	1260560	Why are you using four sheets?
1260560	1261560	What's wrong?
1261560	1262560	It's like me not flushing the toilet in my...
1262560	1263560	It's like, yeah.
1263560	1264560	I'm shaking water.
1264560	1266560	David didn't flush the toilet in his hotel room.
1266560	1268560	I'm like, David, flush the toilet because I go in the bathroom.
1268560	1269560	If it's...
1269560	1271560	Yeah, I'm saving water, Val.
1271560	1273560	I'm an environmentalist, man.
1273560	1274560	I know.
1274560	1276560	That's what I said.
1276560	1281560	So I'm recounting the anecdote of when some Brookesman family member needed
1281560	1284560	some sort of expensive medical procedure that wasn't insured,
1284560	1286560	Bill offered to pay for it.
1286560	1289560	And when the person resisted and said,
1289560	1291560	no, I'm not going to accept your money,
1291560	1294560	Bill said the person who ever was resisting was a liberal.
1294560	1297560	And Bill said that if he refused to let him pay,
1297560	1299560	Bill would instead donate that money to the Republican Party.
1299560	1301560	That's about right, yeah.
1302560	1305560	Bill was bored.
1305560	1306560	Yeah.
1306560	1307560	It was monotonous.
1307560	1308560	Mm-hmm.
1308560	1309560	He bought a dog.
1309560	1310560	Yeah, lazy.
1310560	1311560	Started a family foundation.
1311560	1312560	Yeah.
1312560	1314560	Went to Vegas with some college buddies.
1314560	1315560	Mm-hmm.
1315560	1320560	He sat around puffing his pipe and watching old movies.
1320560	1323560	He sometimes joined Michael Morandy for tennis in Central Park.
1323560	1324560	And...
1324560	1326560	Turned a couple book clubs, too.
1326560	1331560	Morandy could see in his friend's eyes that Bill was not very happy.
1331560	1332560	No.
1332560	1334560	He wrote long letters to newspaper editors that never got published.
1334560	1336560	One was published.
1336560	1337560	You sure about that?
1337560	1342560	Yeah, yeah, there was one published in Washington.
1342560	1343560	I'll show it to you.
1343560	1345560	Yeah, send it to me.
1345560	1347560	He went to the baths alone.
1347560	1348560	Yes, yeah.
1348560	1350560	And it struck up conversations with the strangers
1350560	1353560	because he didn't have his best friend to go there with.
1353560	1355560	And he drank a lot.
1355560	1358560	And he diagnosed himself as an alcoholic.
1358560	1360560	He...
1360560	1362560	Some friends who he went out with at the time
1362560	1365560	said that he would get to a drunk that he puked the next morning.
1365560	1367560	You've obviously told me a kind of similar example.
1367560	1369560	Let's talk about Bob's baths already.
1369560	1370560	Yeah, that was funny.
1370560	1373560	Once again, some of Bill's friends...
1373560	1375560	But to say you're an alcoholic because you puked...
1375560	1377560	He diagnosed himself as an alcoholic.
1377560	1378560	Yeah, I mean, but that's like...
1378560	1379560	I'm not saying he's an alcoholic.
1379560	1380560	And he didn't...
1380560	1382560	At some point, everyone that's drinking too much said,
1382560	1383560	I'm an alcoholic.
1383560	1384560	But then...
1384560	1385560	As you know from your dad's notes,
1385560	1386560	he viewed himself as an alcoholic.
1386560	1387560	Yeah, I hate that, okay.
1387560	1388560	And so did your mom.
1388560	1389560	All right.
1389560	1390560	So I'm not...
1390560	1392560	Again, I'm not saying any of that in a pejorative way.
1392560	1393560	Okay.
1393560	1395560	Once again, some of his friends wonder if he was depressed.
1395560	1397560	One of them, Saman Majd...
1397560	1398560	Saman...
1398560	1399560	Was...
1399560	1402560	This is in emails asking about well-buttern.
1402560	1403560	Yeah.
1403560	1404560	And Bill says, quote,
1404560	1408560	I'm not at all depressed, just very lazy and sluggish.
1408560	1411560	Um...
1411560	1414560	So Stan and Neil calls, lures him back to Meryl.
1414560	1415560	Um...
1415560	1418560	He comes on as a consultant.
1418560	1420560	Doing lots of work.
1420560	1421560	Uh...
1421560	1422560	Describes his nothing too strenuous.
1422560	1424560	He describes to his style, actually.
1424560	1425560	He's nothing too strenuous,
1425560	1427560	but it's fun to be near the game.
1427560	1428560	Okay.
1428560	1429560	We're not the...
1429560	1430560	Uh...
1430560	1431560	What year are we at?
1431560	1432560	We're in...
1432560	1433560	It's 2004.
1433560	1434560	Um...
1434560	1435560	Yeah, 2004-2005.
1435560	1436560	Um...
1436560	1437560	Let's see...
1437560	1442560	Anju, meanwhile, is climbing up the ranks.
1442560	1445560	He's looking for jobs elsewhere.
1445560	1450560	And then I go through a bunch of Anju's piranhas,
1450560	1453560	as one person describes them.
1453560	1454560	And let's see...
1454560	1456560	Let's see...
1467560	1468560	Okay.
1468560	1469560	Um...
1469560	1473560	2007, crisis is bubbling up.
1473560	1477560	And in August, um...
1477560	1479560	Actually, in that summer, Stan and Neil
1479560	1481560	tries to get Bill to come on as a permanent employee.
1481560	1482560	Right.
1482560	1484560	And they don't.
1484560	1486560	He refuses.
1486560	1488560	And he just kind of shook his head sadly.
1488560	1489560	And Neil said,
1489560	1490560	No, I'm not going to do it.
1490560	1491560	And that was the last...
1491560	1492560	He didn't like his books.
1492560	1493560	His derivative books.
1493560	1494560	What was that?
1494560	1495560	He didn't like his derivative books.
1495560	1496560	He didn't like anything.
1496560	1498560	He didn't feel like he was being listened to.
1498560	1499560	And...
1499560	1500560	He felt it wasn't the same Merrill.
1500560	1501560	What was that?
1501560	1503560	He felt it wasn't the same Merrill Lynch.
1503560	1505560	Something had gone wrong.
1505560	1507560	Something had shifted.
1507560	1509560	Did he say that to you?
1509560	1510560	Um...
1510560	1512560	No, I didn't say it to me directly.
1512560	1514560	I don't know if I could sort of feel it.
1514560	1517560	I mean, even conversations with other people
1517560	1520560	and make a piece of it together is that...
1520560	1523560	You know, it's how he felt.
1523560	1525560	I mean, he was always loyal to Merrill Lynch
1525560	1527560	because that's what he made his mark.
1527560	1528560	Yep.
1528560	1529560	It was just kind of heartbreaking for him
1529560	1532560	to see Merrill Lynch fail.
1532560	1533560	Um...
1533560	1536560	Okay, so that August 2007,
1536560	1538560	Anshu calls
1538560	1540560	uh, convinces Bill to come back
1540560	1542560	and work as a consultant
1542560	1544560	on one condition,
1544560	1546560	which is that he doesn't want anyone to report to him.
1546560	1548560	Anshu agrees.
1548560	1551560	Um...
1551560	1554560	Anshu tells someone who he's having lunch with
1554560	1556560	there's one thing he learned from Edson
1556560	1558560	and that's when the shit hits the fan.
1558560	1560560	There's one person you want to stand beside you
1560560	1561560	and that's Bill Brooksman.
1561560	1562560	Yeah.
1562560	1563560	Um...
1563560	1565560	So back they move, Bill and your mom
1565560	1567560	move to London.
1567560	1570560	Uh, the girls and you stay in the States.
1570560	1572560	Um...
1572560	1574560	And he starts advising Anshu
1574560	1578560	on how to deal with some of the crises he's facing.
1578560	1581560	One of them immediately is mortgage IT,
1581560	1583560	which is this shitty mortgage company
1583560	1585560	Deutsche Bank had bought the previous year
1585560	1588560	like the absolute peak of the mortgage market
1588560	1591560	trying to like get stuff that they could feed into
1591560	1593560	the securitization and CDO machine.
1593560	1594560	Okay.
1594560	1595560	And Bill...
1595560	1597560	Leverage your heavily in debt?
1597560	1599560	Well, it's just like making bad mortgage loans
1599560	1601560	to like subprime customers basically.
1601560	1603560	Is it predatory?
1603560	1605560	I don't know if it's predatory.
1605560	1607560	It was certainly the...
1607560	1609560	It was definitely making...
1609560	1612560	It was churning up very risky mortgages
1612560	1614560	on kind of false pretenses
1614560	1617560	and yeah, I guess predatory is probably not a
1617560	1619560	bad word to describe it.
1619560	1620560	Um...
1620560	1622560	So he came in to manage this or to...
1622560	1624560	Well, he came in to advise Anshu on it
1624560	1627560	and the advice he provided was that...
1627560	1629560	Was this like a benchmark
1629560	1632560	or a trigger warning or something for a...
1632560	1634560	What's the word?
1634560	1636560	It's a red flag for things to come
1636560	1638560	and nobody sort of...
1638560	1639560	Nobody took this as a...
1639560	1641560	Well, no, I mean at this point things are going pretty bad
1641560	1642560	pretty quick.
1642560	1643560	Yeah, okay.
1643560	1644560	We're 2007?
1644560	1645560	No.
1645560	1647560	Yeah, this is like fall of 2007.
1647560	1648560	Okay.
1649560	1651560	And keep in mind just as we're going through this,
1651560	1652560	you're getting...
1652560	1653560	It's a marker for things to come.
1653560	1655560	Yeah, but don't think about this in such a literary way
1655560	1657560	because, you know,
1657560	1661560	as a genius literature writer
1661560	1663560	as I am,
1663560	1664560	you're not...
1664560	1665560	Yes.
1665560	1666560	Articulate too.
1666560	1667560	Well done.
1667560	1668560	Yes.
1668560	1669560	You're not getting like...
1669560	1670560	I know.
1670560	1671560	You're not getting a feel for it
1671560	1672560	because I'm jumping around.
1672560	1673560	Sure.
1673560	1676560	And these otherwise will be here.
1676560	1678560	Yeah, I'm just curious if you're using this
1678560	1680560	as like a marker for what's going on.
1680560	1682560	No, I'm using this actually as an indication
1682560	1684560	of a real, like,
1684560	1686560	weighing in on something in a very practical way.
1686560	1688560	And basically this business
1688560	1690560	that they had just spent half a billion dollars
1690560	1691560	on months earlier
1691560	1693560	is now, according to Bill, worthless.
1693560	1695560	Like literally not worth anything.
1695560	1696560	And so what do you do with that?
1696560	1697560	One option is,
1697560	1698560	at the end of the year,
1698560	1699560	you write it off entirely
1699560	1701560	and acknowledge it's worth zero.
1701560	1704560	But that means you have to take a huge loss
1704560	1705560	and account on the loss anyway.
1705560	1707560	That would mean you've recognized
1707560	1709560	and you basically take...
1709560	1710560	Whatever you spent on it,
1710560	1711560	you're taking that as a loss now.
1711560	1712560	If it's really worth zero.
1712560	1714560	In addition to being bad financially,
1714560	1716560	this is like really embarrassing.
1716560	1717560	Sure.
1717560	1719560	So Bill comes up with a different solution,
1719560	1723560	which is that it can basically hover in place
1723560	1726560	and not do any more risky loans,
1726560	1727560	only do good loans,
1727560	1731560	and that will kind of allow them to be able
1731560	1734560	to move forward without actually acknowledging
1734560	1735560	how bad their investment was.
1735560	1737560	So it's kind of a graceful way.
1737560	1740560	I mean, saying it's kind of paper things over,
1740560	1742560	but not in like a bad way.
1742560	1745560	It's just like...
1745560	1748560	So he comes back full-time in 2008.
1748560	1750560	He's got his obscure title,
1750560	1752560	which is head of capital and risk optimization
1752560	1754560	for the investment bank.
1754560	1757560	And so despite the obscure title,
1757560	1758560	you know, everyone knew
1758560	1759560	if he reported directly to Anshu,
1759560	1763560	and Anshu like deeply valued his opinion.
1763560	1765560	And Anshu could show that
1765560	1766560	for all the cowboys we have,
1766560	1767560	we also have Bill,
1767560	1774560	the former colleague said.
1774560	1777560	He starts up weekly risk management meetings,
1777560	1778560	which hadn't existed.
1778560	1781560	He starts like really just like looking
1781560	1782560	around these businesses,
1782560	1784560	looking, trying to understand them.
1784560	1787560	And, you know, seeing a lot of problems
1787560	1789560	and trying to slowly but surely clean them up.
1789560	1792560	And this is right as the financial crisis
1792560	1794560	is hitting in Deutsche Bank,
1794560	1796560	as you probably know,
1796560	1798560	is actually a big winner in the crisis,
1798560	1801560	partly because they had, you know,
1801560	1804560	they were shorting.
1804560	1806560	There's some short all these CDOs,
1806560	1808560	which they had actually helped manufacture.
1808560	1810560	And so they were,
1810560	1812560	and playing both sides of this,
1812560	1814560	and it was very profitable for them.
1814560	1816560	And that came from that Deutsche Bank guy
1816560	1818560	that made quite a good...
1818560	1819560	Yeah.
1819560	1821560	So Greg Lippmann is who you're thinking of,
1821560	1823560	who was kind of immortalized in the Big Short.
1823560	1825560	You're in Big Short.
1826560	1827560	Okay.
1827560	1830560	Okay, we're just going to pause this for a sec and...
1855560	1856560	Okay.
1861560	1863560	Are you feeling tired?
1863560	1864560	I'm feeling good.
1864560	1866560	I mean, this is weird.
1866560	1867560	Yeah.
1867560	1868560	So much.
1868560	1869560	So cool.
1869560	1870560	It's intense.
1870560	1871560	Yeah, it's intense.
1871560	1873560	And it's like...
1876560	1878560	Because you kind of have to go
1878560	1880560	open everything down.
1880560	1881560	Yeah.
1881560	1883560	And also, like...
1885560	1887560	I mean, I'm telling you everything,
1887560	1889560	but I'm also trying to, like...
1890560	1892560	Be nice to us and this stuff.
1892560	1893560	Not really.
1893560	1895560	I'm just telling you, I just...
1895560	1897560	I don't want to let you hear this from anyone else.
1897560	1898560	Yeah, but...
1902560	1903560	For sure.
1903560	1904560	That's...
1904560	1906560	That's a very good way.
1906560	1908560	It'll be worse.
1908560	1909560	Absolutely.
1909560	1911560	That's why I'm doing this.
1911560	1912560	Yeah.
1912560	1913560	It's just...
1913560	1915560	The point being, not that I'm not telling you.
1915560	1917560	It's intense.
1917560	1918560	And I'm just...
1918560	1919560	I'm aware of it.
1919560	1920560	I'm aware of it.
1920560	1921560	I'm aware of it.
1921560	1924560	And also, cognizant of that...
1924560	1926560	What is on my computer screen right now?
1926560	1927560	It's an obvious...
1927560	1931560	The book is going to go through a zillion revisions
1931560	1934560	and changes and edits and restructures
1934560	1935560	and things like that.
1935560	1936560	So this is all...
1936560	1938560	It's all in flux, you know?
1938560	1941560	And so he's hearing it now.
1941560	1942560	You're hearing it now.
1942560	1943560	Sorry?
1943560	1944560	Yeah, let's see.
1946560	1947560	You ready?
1947560	1948560	Actually, you know what?
1948560	1951560	I'm going to drop this with a scoop of steamer.
1954560	1956560	Greg Lippmann.
1956560	1957560	Greg Lippmann.
1957560	1958560	Something Lippmann.
1958560	1962560	Yeah, so Deutsche Bank was creating these CDOs
1962560	1964560	and short-selling their own...
1964560	1965560	their own CDOs.
1965560	1967560	Did you pull that thing?
1971560	1972560	Yeah.
1987560	1989560	So they were creating packaging CDOs
1989560	1991560	and short-selling them?
1993560	1995560	So this is where Fred DePaul's loft came in.
1995560	1997560	They would use...
1997560	2001560	So you take...
2001560	2005560	So do you want me to just explain this as if you're an idiot?
2005560	2006560	Yeah, absolutely.
2006560	2007560	Yeah.
2007560	2008560	Yeah.
2008560	2009560	So...
2011560	2012560	Okay, so you take a mortgage.
2012560	2013560	Right.
2013560	2014560	Take a bunch of it, which is...
2014560	2015560	Right.
2015560	2017560	Package that together into a mortgage security.
2017560	2018560	Sure.
2018560	2020560	You then take a bunch of mortgage securities.
2020560	2021560	Right.
2021560	2023560	Mush them together and then like shop them up
2023560	2024560	depending on their risk.
2024560	2025560	Conscious.
2025560	2026560	Yeah, very good.
2026560	2027560	Conscious.
2027560	2029560	I told you I was going to tell you like you're an idiot
2029560	2030560	even though you're not an idiot.
2030560	2032560	So the...
2032560	2034560	And those are CDOs, right?
2034560	2035560	Right.
2035560	2037560	You then use credit default swaps.
2037560	2041560	CDS, which are insurance contracts essentially
2041560	2042560	to bet against those CDOs.
2042560	2043560	Right.
2043560	2045560	And so Deutsche Bank on the one hand
2045560	2047560	was taking all these mortgages,
2047560	2049560	some of which they were producing through mortgage IT
2049560	2050560	that's coming from what they bought.
2050560	2051560	Oh, okay.
2051560	2054560	Packaging those into mortgage-backed securities,
2054560	2058560	into CDOs, which Greg Lipman's squad was selling
2058560	2060560	to dummies all over the world.
2060560	2061560	Right.
2061560	2064560	And then simultaneously betting against those very CDOs.
2064560	2065560	Which is the short sell.
2065560	2066560	Which is the short sell.
2066560	2070560	So they not only are both selling something bad
2070560	2072560	and betting that they're going to fail,
2072560	2074560	but they also kind of have inside knowledge
2074560	2076560	of what's going to do well and what's not going to do well
2076560	2077560	because they're fucking mortgages.
2077560	2078560	Sure.
2078560	2079560	So...
2079560	2080560	Yeah.
2080560	2082560	Well, they not only packed them, they originated them.
2082560	2084560	They were, because of mortgage IT,
2084560	2086560	they're actually producing these mortgages
2086560	2088560	because they know every step of the process.
2088560	2091560	I didn't realize that mortgage IT was the conduit.
2091560	2093560	Well, it was just part of it.
2093560	2095560	I mean, I didn't even actually realize that myself
2095560	2097560	until recently when I was going through
2097560	2100560	the huge settlement they had, Deutsche Bank had,
2100560	2103560	which was last year or the year before last.
2103560	2106560	And it goes, the Justice Department itself,
2106560	2108560	just goes in great detail to the role,
2108560	2111560	the fraudulent role that mortgage IT played.
2111560	2114560	And so, well, we'll get to this later,
2114560	2117560	but that's one of the things,
2117560	2119560	I don't know this, I'm just speculating,
2119560	2121560	but it's possible that your dad,
2121560	2124560	given the advice that he had given to Anchu
2124560	2125560	about that business and saying,
2125560	2127560	don't shut it down, keep it going
2127560	2129560	so we don't need to recognize that big loss.
2129560	2132560	It's not impossible that that was
2132560	2135560	like a little bit bothersome to people.
2135560	2136560	Right.
2136560	2139560	I don't know that, though, that's just pure speculation.
2139560	2142560	So, okay, crisis ends.
2142560	2143560	To not bring mortgage IT to light
2143560	2145560	or to sort of give mortgage IT to the past?
2145560	2147560	No, it gave it a, yeah, to give it a pass.
2147560	2148560	They gave it like another lease on life.
2148560	2151560	They allowed it to continue operating for a while.
2151560	2153560	Again, I'm not making much of that
2153560	2155560	because I don't really know, but it's...
2155560	2156560	That's an interesting idea.
2156560	2158560	I mean, with the benefit of hindsight,
2158560	2160560	that wasn't the best plan.
2160560	2161560	Right.
2161560	2165560	What they came up with, hindsight's 20-20.
2165560	2168560	Okay, so this is where, starting around 2010,
2168560	2172560	Deutsche Bank, it's big decline begins.
2172560	2174560	So, it survived the crisis better than most
2174560	2176560	because Greg Litman and his ilk
2176560	2178560	were making billions of dollars
2178560	2180560	short in the mortgage market.
2180560	2184560	And Deutsche Bank executives,
2184560	2187560	primarily Anchu and Joe Ackerman,
2187560	2192560	mistook their relative success during the crisis
2192560	2194560	as a sign that they were just in the clear.
2194560	2197560	And they step on the gas.
2197560	2200560	And Anchu is kind of losing touch with reality.
2200560	2202560	It seems like according to a bunch of people
2202560	2203560	who worked with him.
2203560	2207560	And also, they are...
2207560	2210560	The so-called piranhas around Anchu
2210560	2212560	are, no one is paying any attention to them.
2212560	2215560	So, that includes Christian Bittar,
2215560	2218560	who is the LIBOR trader.
2218560	2220560	It includes...
2220560	2222560	Call him, can I...
2222560	2223560	Be patient.
2223560	2226560	It includes the tax trades that they were doing
2226560	2227560	for renaissance.
2227560	2228560	The basket options.
2228560	2230560	The basket options are good.
2230560	2236560	And it includes...
2236560	2240560	It includes Monty Deposky.
2240560	2242560	And Kelly Faisola.
2242560	2243560	Good.
2243560	2246560	And yeah, it includes these crazed trading floors
2246560	2248560	that Colin Fan is presiding over.
2248560	2249560	So, here's one thing.
2249560	2251560	This is one of the most interesting things
2251560	2256560	I think I've found in my reporting.
2256560	2259560	It's just an anecdote, but it's a telling one.
2259560	2261560	So, in...
2261560	2264560	I'm trying to figure out exactly the date here.
2264560	2267560	I think 2010.
2267560	2272560	Let's give it a take, 2010.
2272560	2276560	There was a trader, a whole group of traders, actually,
2276560	2279560	in their bond traders.
2279560	2283560	And they were trading on mortgages.
2283560	2284560	But this was after the crisis.
2284560	2285560	So, they were actually betting,
2285560	2287560	whereas Deutsche Bank had made this big short bet
2287560	2288560	against the housing market.
2288560	2289560	The exposition?
2289560	2291560	This was the opposite.
2291560	2293560	So, they were now betting on the housing market
2293560	2294560	to recover.
2294560	2296560	And this guy's name is Troy Dixon.
2296560	2298560	He's like a young guy.
2298560	2302560	And it had a whole group that they were making
2302560	2305560	a very big, like multi-billion dollar bet
2305560	2308560	the housing market was going to come back to life
2308560	2311560	in a big way, which is fine.
2311560	2314560	But the bets were really, really big.
2314560	2316560	And so, risk managers started getting very worried.
2316560	2317560	How big?
2317560	2320560	Billions.
2320560	2324560	And the risk management team in the investment bank
2324560	2325560	didn't have anywhere to go.
2325560	2326560	No one would listen to their concerns.
2326560	2328560	So, they went to your dad.
2328560	2330560	And Bill took a look at...
2330560	2332560	The risk guys had basically compiled a dossier
2332560	2333560	of all this stuff.
2333560	2335560	And so, Bill started going through the dossier
2335560	2337560	and agreed that what they were showing
2337560	2339560	him did not look good.
2339560	2342560	It looked like this is just like a gigantic risk.
2342560	2346560	So, he went to talk to Troy Dixon's group.
2346560	2349560	And Dixon was like, fuck you old man.
2349560	2350560	I'm not going to...
2350560	2352560	Like, who are you?
2352560	2356560	And this went back and forth.
2356560	2357560	They fought.
2357560	2360560	Bill went back to the risk managers and said
2360560	2362560	he'd receive a strong pushback, that's a quote,
2362560	2366560	from above in the efforts to rein Dixon in.
2366560	2367560	Dixon kept...
2367560	2369560	Or Bill kept pushing.
2369560	2371560	Dixon kept getting angry.
2371560	2374560	And without any success, Bill did not manage to corral.
2374560	2377560	And he could tell that he was pissing Troy Dixon off.
2377560	2378560	Pissing off his whole group.
2378560	2380560	And so, he tried to patch those up.
2380560	2383560	And he invited Dixon and about 10 other traders
2383560	2385560	from that desk out to dinner.
2385560	2388560	It was an Italian restaurant in Tribeca.
2388560	2390560	Large candlelit table.
2390560	2392560	Floral tapestries on the wall.
2392560	2393560	Okay.
2393560	2395560	So, you went there?
2395560	2396560	Yeah.
2396560	2399560	So, dinner gets off to an awkward start.
2399560	2402560	And Bill and Troy are still bickering about the wisdom
2402560	2403560	of these trades.
2403560	2405560	And neither of them would drop.
2405560	2407560	And Dixon's crew, it's a little posse,
2407560	2409560	is around the hill like kind of snickering at your dad.
2409560	2410560	Snickering at my dad.
2410560	2411560	Snickering.
2411560	2412560	That he's out of his depth.
2412560	2413560	He doesn't understand this stuff.
2413560	2414560	Which is crazy.
2414560	2416560	Does your father is out of his depth?
2416560	2417560	They don't know who...
2417560	2419560	He wasn't out of their depth.
2419560	2421560	These guys are like young, obnoxious.
2421560	2422560	Yeah, they thought right down.
2422560	2424560	They thought they were laughing at him.
2424560	2425560	They were starting to.
2425560	2427560	Anyway, they stopped talking about this trades
2427560	2428560	and there's a conversation with me,
2428560	2429560	and there's something else.
2429560	2430560	And I don't know.
2430560	2431560	I think I'm going to be asking you at one point.
2431560	2433560	Do you know who Jerry Sundusky is?
2433560	2434560	Did I ask you that?
2434560	2436560	Yeah, it's the guy that was molesting people
2436560	2437560	in the showers or something.
2437560	2438560	He was a former college,
2438560	2440560	Penn College football coach.
2440560	2441560	Yeah.
2441560	2443560	Or Penn State College football coach.
2443560	2444560	Yeah.
2444560	2445560	Or he knew about the other guy.
2445560	2446560	Right?
2446560	2447560	There wasn't a documentary.
2447560	2450560	Yeah, no, that's Joe Paterno.
2450560	2452560	He's the guy who...
2452560	2453560	Now, how is this relevant?
2453560	2454560	You'll see.
2454560	2457560	Oh, right, because you didn't know who he was.
2457560	2459560	Maybe I've told you some of this before.
2459560	2462560	Yeah, and I was texting him for a long time
2462560	2463560	trying to say,
2463560	2465560	well, I didn't even know who the guy was
2465560	2466560	until he heard his name.
2466560	2467560	Yeah, it's fair enough.
2467560	2469560	Bill had never heard of the guy.
2469560	2470560	He had just write them a sentence
2470560	2471560	to at least 30 years in prison
2471560	2472560	for child molestation.
2472560	2476560	And someone at the table remarked that
2476560	2479560	child molesters in for a tough time in prison.
2479560	2481560	And your dad said,
2481560	2482560	why?
2482560	2484560	And the traitors looked at each other.
2484560	2486560	This dude for real.
2486560	2487560	And someone says,
2487560	2490560	finally, you see molested boys.
2490560	2491560	So?
2491560	2492560	Why?
2492560	2494560	Why is that reason for a tough time?
2494560	2497560	And Bill did not get that child molesters
2497560	2500560	were like the most hated people in prison.
2500560	2501560	This is like fair enough.
2501560	2502560	Kept asking questions.
2502560	2503560	Okay.
2503560	2504560	Why?
2504560	2505560	Why?
2505560	2506560	Why?
2506560	2508560	And once again, the snickering starts up.
2508560	2510560	They're just fucking laughing at him.
2510560	2513560	One of them described it as this old man was clueless.
2513560	2514560	Okay.
2514560	2516560	Uh, end of the meal.
2516560	2519560	Bill picks up the tab and just bolts.
2519560	2521560	He's like, doesn't even really say goodbye.
2521560	2523560	He just heads straight for the subway.
2523560	2527560	And Troy Dixon and his buddies go back to the bar,
2527560	2528560	go back to a bar,
2528560	2530560	and they just spend the night laughing
2530560	2532560	about how this weird guy,
2532560	2535560	like didn't know that Jerry Sandusky doesn't understand prison.
2535560	2537560	And then they went back to work.
2537560	2538560	Fuck these guys.
2538560	2539560	Fuck these guys.
2539560	2540560	What were they?
2540560	2541560	Who cares?
2541560	2542560	Well, they were...
2542560	2543560	They were wrong anyway.
2543560	2544560	My dad was right.
2544560	2545560	This is...
2545560	2547560	And he cares if you didn't fucking Jerry Sandusky.
2547560	2548560	I didn't know who he was either.
2548560	2551560	And my dad isn't really up to what's going on in the prison world.
2551560	2553560	But I'm pretty sure he was trying to figure out
2553560	2554560	why they're talking about this.
2554560	2557560	I mean, I'm sure if he said to my dad,
2557560	2558560	at any point in time,
2558560	2561560	a child molester would have trouble in prison,
2561560	2562560	he would understand that.
2562560	2564560	That's not something that was over his head.
2564560	2567560	But at this, probably the context of this meeting,
2567560	2569560	if this is true what they say,
2569560	2570560	he could be either,
2570560	2571560	he's trying to fuck with them
2571560	2572560	or get a read on them,
2572560	2574560	saying why, why, why, over and over
2574560	2578560	to see how deeply, deeply moronic these people are
2578560	2580560	to continue this line of questioning,
2580560	2583560	to see why he would perceive them to be...
2583560	2585560	Their responses to his why
2585560	2587560	is how he reads other people.
2587560	2589560	My dad was here in the room.
2589560	2590560	And he says,
2590560	2591560	my dad was here in the room
2591560	2592560	and he says,
2592560	2594560	why do you want quite an obvious question?
2594560	2596560	He's got to get a read on you.
2596560	2598560	He's not actually asking why.
2598560	2600560	Like, the sky's blue, why?
2600560	2602560	He's trying to figure out how you perceive it
2602560	2603560	and what you're...
2603560	2604560	He's trying to get some time
2604560	2606560	to make up his mind about you
2606560	2608560	and he's giving you something to talk about.
2608560	2610560	I think he's pretty much made up his mind
2610560	2612560	before he went out to dinner with these guys.
2612560	2613560	He did not like them.
2613560	2616560	And I'm not sure that was bad on his part.
2616560	2617560	There's very...
2617560	2618560	My read on this, though,
2618560	2621560	is just putting aside what Bill's intent was.
2621560	2624560	The reality is that these...
2624560	2626560	It was like a generational shift
2626560	2627560	going on in Wall Street
2627560	2628560	and the guys who had grown up
2628560	2631560	viewing derivatives as casino instruments
2631560	2633560	were on the rise
2633560	2636560	and guys like Bill who had grown up
2636560	2638560	viewing them primarily as hedging devices
2638560	2640560	and client-centric devices
2640560	2641560	were on the way out
2641560	2645560	and the young guys didn't have any respect
2645560	2647560	for the slightly older guys.
2647560	2648560	That makes sense.
2648560	2649560	But in the anecdote,
2649560	2652560	it seems like the takeaway from it
2652560	2655560	is that my dad was out of touch.
2655560	2656560	No, that's not...
2656560	2657560	Because if you're saying,
2657560	2658560	why, why, why...
2658560	2659560	Trust me, Val, that's not...
2659560	2660560	Maybe I'm...
2660560	2663560	Well, this is just the danger of doing it this way.
2663560	2665560	If I read it, I'm sure...
2665560	2668560	This is kind of a sad moment for Bill.
2668560	2670560	Like, there's...
2670560	2671560	Why?
2671560	2673560	Because you think he's realizing he's out of touch?
2673560	2676560	He's realizing that there's been a generational shift.
2676560	2677560	But there's a paradox here
2677560	2679560	because yes, he's maybe out of touch
2679560	2681560	with what's going on in current events,
2681560	2683560	but he's obviously very much in touch
2683560	2685560	because he's trying to rein in these idiots
2685560	2687560	to stop doing something different.
2687560	2690560	Dixon's trades blow up,
2690560	2693560	cost Deutsche Bank half a billion dollars,
2693560	2695560	and federal regulators start investigating.
2695560	2697560	So that was totally right.
2697560	2698560	He has the last laugh,
2698560	2700560	but it's just not a very funny laugh
2700560	2703560	because people aren't listening.
2703560	2705560	And this is a pattern that's about to repeat itself
2705560	2706560	over and over and over again.
2706560	2708560	Because people stop listening to him.
2708560	2710560	To this old man from a different era.
2711560	2713560	That makes sense.
2722560	2724560	So you think he felt he was out of touch
2724560	2726560	and he didn't know how to rein in these fools?
2726560	2727560	He didn't know how to rein them in,
2727560	2729560	just no one would listen to him.
2729560	2731560	But he didn't have the backing necessary?
2731560	2734560	I mean, but he had the power of Deutsche Bank behind him.
2734560	2736560	How could they not rein in Troy Dixon
2736560	2739560	and his crew of fucking morons?
2740560	2741560	They weren't morons.
2741560	2743560	They were just making a very big, risky bet.
2743560	2745560	It sounded pretty moronic to me.
2748560	2753560	So, one of the lessons here
2753560	2755560	that I've picked up on...
2755560	2758560	Sorry, I'm just upset someone's fucking with my dad.
2758560	2759560	No, I get it, man.
2759560	2761560	And that's the direction you're supposed to have.
2761560	2763560	It's a reader you're supposed to have.
2763560	2764560	Yeah.
2764560	2767560	They're being...
2767560	2768560	Where you going?
2768560	2770560	I'm just going to put this to charge
2770560	2772560	and have a proper cigarette.
2776560	2778560	One of the big takeaways I have
2778560	2780560	about your dad and his role as a bank
2780560	2782560	is that your dad is like a good man.
2782560	2784560	He's an honest man,
2784560	2786560	makes mistakes like we all do,
2786560	2788560	but he's a good human being.
2790560	2792560	But one of the things that
2792560	2794560	there's no way it was not bothering him
2794560	2797560	is that his role was changed.
2797560	2799560	With Edson, he was like the right-hand man
2799560	2802560	who was just
2802560	2805560	an integral part of the kind of ecosystem,
2805560	2806560	the functioning.
2806560	2808560	He was the super ego to Edson's id.
2810560	2812560	In the second round at Deutsche Bank,
2812560	2813560	he's not bad.
2813560	2816560	There is no need for a super ego.
2816560	2817560	This bank is out of control.
2817560	2819560	Nobody's listening to him.
2819560	2821560	And there is...
2821560	2823560	No one wants to hear bad news anymore.
2823560	2825560	No one wants someone to say no.
2825560	2827560	They think they're so smart.
2827560	2829560	They just surfed through the financial crisis.
2829560	2831560	The greatest disruption since the 1920's
2831560	2833560	or 1930's.
2833560	2835560	They don't need
2835560	2836560	Dr. Nell.
2836560	2837560	Right.
2837560	2838560	Okay.
2841560	2842560	Anchi becomes CEO.
2842560	2843560	Okay.
2843560	2844560	In 2012.
2844560	2845560	Co-CEO.
2846560	2848560	So the hubris has taken over.
2848560	2849560	The hubris has taken over.
2849560	2850560	Okay.
2850560	2851560	Okay.
2853560	2855560	Anchi is one of his main priorities.
2855560	2856560	It's because they got lucky.
2856560	2858560	They thought they were smarter than everyone else.
2858560	2860560	One of the chapters right now is titled
2860560	2862560	Luck vs. Skill.
2863560	2864560	Hey.
2864560	2865560	Good.
2865560	2866560	I just predicted that.
2866560	2867560	Interesting.
2867560	2868560	Okay.
2868560	2870560	Or there while you just directed me toward that.
2870560	2871560	Interesting.
2871560	2872560	Did I just say that was...
2872560	2873560	We got that on camera.
2873560	2875560	I just said
2875560	2878560	without knowing anything about what he was saying
2878560	2880560	that this bank was lucky
2880560	2882560	but they thought that they were smarter than everyone else.
2882560	2884560	David said the next title of the chapter
2884560	2886560	is Luck vs. Skill.
2886560	2887560	So that's good.
2887560	2888560	So as a reader
2888560	2889560	this is good.
2889560	2890560	It's interesting.
2890560	2892560	I just want to point that out.
2893560	2894560	We got it.
2894560	2895560	Saved your posterity on that.
2895560	2896560	Yeah.
2896560	2897560	On my iPhone.
2897560	2898560	Interesting.
2898560	2899560	Okay.
2899560	2901560	So here comes an incident that
2901560	2902560	you know a bit about
2902560	2904560	but I think you'll learn a little bit more.
2904560	2906560	So Anchi
2906560	2908560	takes over as CEO
2908560	2911560	and wants to fill the place with his loyalists.
2911560	2912560	Right.
2912560	2913560	Your dad is a loyalist
2913560	2915560	or at least that's how he comes to perceive some.
2915560	2917560	And so he puts your dad up
2917560	2919560	for the job of chief risk officer.
2921560	2923560	And he tells Bill
2923560	2925560	that it's a perfect fit.
2925560	2927560	Like he gets risk management better than anyone else
2927560	2928560	on to trust him.
2928560	2930560	And it's like a big leap up.
2930560	2932560	He'll go on the Vorstand
2932560	2933560	which is the management committee
2933560	2934560	which is like this
2934560	2936560	rarefied board that previously
2936560	2938560	had been off-limits to anyone who wasn't German.
2940560	2942560	And it's a big jump up.
2944560	2946560	His friends congratulate him.
2947560	2948560	He and Michael Morandi
2948560	2949560	are just like weird joke
2949560	2952560	where Morandi is called monkey business.
2952560	2953560	Okay.
2953560	2954560	Which is Moran,
2954560	2956560	they would like go out to dinner together
2956560	2958560	and like clumsily hit on waitresses
2958560	2959560	and whoever other,
2959560	2960560	whatever other women were around
2960560	2961560	and like,
2961560	2962560	not they're going to do anything
2962560	2963560	but just like,
2963560	2964560	he's been around.
2964560	2965560	And so Morandi,
2965560	2966560	when he learned that Bill
2966560	2968560	has been put up for this very important job,
2968560	2971560	laments that there will be no more monkey business.
2972560	2973560	And Deutsche Bank,
2973560	2974560	after announcing this to the world,
2974560	2976560	decides that maybe it would be a good idea
2976560	2977560	to check with the German regulators,
2977560	2978560	Bafen,
2978560	2980560	over whether this is okay.
2980560	2982560	Because Bafen actually has veto power over this.
2982560	2983560	Okay.
2983560	2984560	And Bafen's students over this
2984560	2985560	for a little while.
2985560	2987560	Who says to suggest Bafen?
2987560	2990560	Deutsche Bank has to submit this
2990560	2991560	to Bafen's approval.
2991560	2992560	They have to.
2992560	2994560	The reasons that remain unclear,
2994560	2997560	they decided it would be smart to announce the job
2997560	2998560	before they'd actually sought
2998560	3000560	or received approval from the regulators.
3000560	3001560	Okay.
3001560	3002560	Not smart.
3002560	3003560	No.
3003560	3006560	Bafen already was very troubled but on to
3006560	3010560	and concerned about his recklessness
3010560	3012560	and his lack of management savvy
3012560	3017560	and perceived on to as putting into
3017560	3019560	arguably the most important job in the bank,
3019560	3020560	Chief Risk Officer,
3020560	3023560	one of his kind of flak flunkies.
3023560	3025560	So they consider my dad a flunky to answer?
3025560	3026560	Yes.
3026560	3027560	They perceive that way.
3027560	3028560	What about Ackerman?
3028560	3030560	Well, Ackerman's gone at this point.
3030560	3031560	Oh.
3031560	3032560	He stepped down.
3032560	3033560	So, in fact,
3033560	3035560	Bill wonders to his friend,
3035560	3036560	so Bafen rejects it.
3036560	3038560	It's a very embarrassing situation for him.
3038560	3039560	He's been given this big promotion.
3039560	3041560	Wait, we're in 2012.
3041560	3042560	In 2012.
3042560	3043560	Okay.
3043560	3044560	He gets this big promotion,
3044560	3045560	huge promotion.
3045560	3047560	It's all like newspapers write stories about it.
3047560	3048560	The FT did a lot on it.
3048560	3049560	They write the journal too.
3049560	3051560	And then it gets rescinded.
3051560	3052560	Right.
3052560	3054560	And so Bill wonders to his friends and colleagues
3054560	3056560	that he speculates that perhaps he was just
3056560	3057560	a victim of sabotage.
3057560	3061560	And maybe Ackerman had basically
3061560	3063560	stabbed him in the back with the regulators
3063560	3064560	because he wanted,
3064560	3066560	Ackerman wanted to hurt Anshu.
3066560	3069560	In any case,
3069560	3071560	he'd been receiving all these congrats
3071560	3073560	and throwing emails and phone calls all month
3073560	3076560	and now he has to go back to people over and over
3076560	3078560	and explain that the job has been revoked.
3078560	3079560	Okay.
3079560	3081560	Easy come, easy go,
3081560	3083560	was the voicemail he left for his mother.
3086560	3087560	And he sounds nonchalant,
3087560	3089560	but when Pete, his brother,
3089560	3090560	listens...
3090560	3091560	Peter.
3091560	3092560	I call him Peter.
3092560	3093560	It's Peter.
3093560	3094560	No one calls him Peter.
3094560	3095560	It's written Peter.
3095560	3096560	I'm just reading with notches.
3096560	3097560	Okay.
3098560	3100560	When Peter listens to the message,
3100560	3102560	you can tell that he says
3102560	3104560	there's no concealing the hurt in his voice.
3104560	3105560	Really?
3106560	3108560	I don't know.
3108560	3109560	I remember he told me.
3109560	3111560	It didn't seem...
3111560	3112560	I don't think that is what he told you.
3112560	3113560	We'll get to that in a second.
3113560	3114560	Oh.
3114560	3115560	I mean, when he told me,
3115560	3116560	I didn't take up any...
3116560	3117560	Well, he didn't...
3117560	3118560	We'll get to it.
3118560	3119560	He told you an email.
3119560	3120560	Sorry?
3120560	3122560	He told you in an email how he felt.
3122560	3123560	So we'll get to that in a second.
3123560	3124560	No, he told me over dinner.
3124560	3126560	We'll get to it in a second.
3126560	3127560	I'll read it to you.
3128560	3130560	He told Sam
3130560	3133560	that he felt insulted.
3133560	3134560	He told John Bright
3134560	3137560	the particle physicist from Merrill
3137560	3140560	that he knew he should be relieved.
3140560	3142560	But once I quote...
3142560	3143560	But once I started thinking about the job,
3143560	3145560	I liked it.
3145560	3146560	Miranda joked,
3146560	3148560	we're back in the monkey business.
3148560	3151560	Bill laughed and looked sad.
3151560	3153560	And then, at the end of the year,
3153560	3155560	this pattern defeated itself
3155560	3157560	because Bill was put up for another senior job
3157560	3159560	running the non-core unit at Deutsche Bank.
3159560	3160560	And once again,
3160560	3163560	Boppen shot it down after it had been announced.
3163560	3166560	So this is around the time that Bill,
3166560	3167560	as a consolation prize,
3167560	3169560	gets put on DBTCA's board.
3173560	3176560	So we've got a bunch of DBTCA history here.
3176560	3179560	And he felt he was being set up now at this point.
3179560	3181560	He didn't really feel he was being set up.
3181560	3183560	He felt like he needed to...
3183560	3186560	There was some concern over him feeling set up
3186560	3188560	for what was about to happen at Deutsche Bank
3188560	3190560	according to the therapist.
3191560	3193560	I don't think that's quite right.
3193560	3195560	There's to be a fall guy, in a sense.
3195560	3196560	I think he...
3196560	3198560	Because he saw what was coming.
3198560	3200560	I don't think he saw what was coming.
3200560	3202560	I think he viewed...
3202560	3205560	What do you mean there's the DOJ investigations?
3205560	3207560	We'll get there. Don't worry. I promise you.
3207560	3210560	There's a DOJ investigation involved in your dad?
3210560	3211560	You're the one that told me that.
3211560	3213560	I'm kidding, man. God!
3213560	3214560	Monty, okay.
3214560	3215560	Just be patient.
3215560	3218560	Allow me my narrative pasting.
3219560	3222560	So, what we do know about Bill at that point
3222560	3223560	is that he views...
3223560	3225560	Allow me my narrative pasting.
3225560	3228560	He feels like
3228560	3231560	he is kind of being wedged into a doubly.
3231560	3232560	He doesn't really want,
3232560	3234560	but he's just been publicly humiliated twice.
3234560	3235560	Yeah.
3235560	3237560	And this is kind of face-saving
3237560	3239560	and it's some way to get a little bit of lost status back.
3239560	3240560	Yeah, that's right.
3240560	3241560	He's not getting...
3241560	3243560	I mean, he's getting paid a lot by human standards,
3243560	3244560	but not by bankers.
3244560	3246560	It's an extra hundred grand.
3248560	3250560	So, around that time,
3250560	3253560	Bill and
3253560	3256560	Aala reconnect with Scott Mitchell.
3256560	3257560	Do you know Scott Mitchell?
3257560	3259560	Yeah, he's come a few times.
3259560	3260560	He's Edson's son.
3260560	3261560	Right.
3261560	3265560	And they hadn't seen each other in a decade,
3265560	3267560	but in 2012,
3267560	3269560	Scott happened to sit down for lunch
3269560	3271560	or something with Anshu.
3271560	3273560	Anshu pushed the two of them to...
3273560	3276560	pushed the Mitchell and Brooks McClanns
3276560	3277560	to like...
3277560	3278560	because they'd been...
3278560	3279560	there's a huge following up
3279560	3282560	because Bill and Aala had supported...
3282560	3283560	Estelle.
3283560	3284560	Estelle, which, you know,
3284560	3285560	not surprisingly,
3285560	3287560	Susan and her kids
3287560	3288560	viewed as a betrayal.
3288560	3289560	Right.
3289560	3294560	And Scott is...
3294560	3296560	both Bill and Scott
3296560	3297560	agree to a meeting.
3297560	3298560	They book reservations for lunch
3298560	3299560	and then they keep...
3299560	3300560	each of them keeps canceling.
3300560	3301560	Right.
3301560	3302560	And finally,
3302560	3304560	they get thanks to some product
3304560	3305560	from Bill's assistant.
3305560	3308560	They finally, like, plan for lunch.
3308560	3310560	And they go to a Japanese restaurant
3310560	3312560	in Union Square, 15 East.
3312560	3314560	And Alessa went to dinner.
3314560	3315560	Okay.
3315560	3318560	And so did Scott's sister.
3318560	3320560	So it was Bill, Alessa, Scott,
3320560	3322560	and Scott's sister, Ella.
3322560	3323560	Okay.
3323560	3326560	12 years since they'd seen each other.
3326560	3328560	And Scott, at this point,
3328560	3331560	is like a spitting image of Edson.
3331560	3333560	And Alessa blurts out
3333560	3335560	the moment they see him.
3335560	3336560	He's Edson.
3336560	3337560	Holy shit.
3337560	3339560	Scott, who's a little bit drunk
3339560	3341560	because he had been so nervous
3341560	3342560	and would, like, just drink a bunch
3342560	3344560	before dinner.
3344560	3345560	You know, sitting down,
3345560	3346560	they're both...
3346560	3348560	Scott's sweating profusely.
3348560	3351560	And your dad ordered some nice wine.
3351560	3352560	The more they drank,
3352560	3353560	the more things calmed down,
3353560	3355560	the more fun they're having.
3355560	3356560	Scott does his...
3356560	3358560	his arm show impersonation.
3358560	3360560	You are smarter than hell and talented.
3360560	3362560	How do we get you up to your metrics?
3362560	3364560	Scott, by the way, is a used car salesman
3364560	3366560	at that point.
3366560	3368560	That's a horrible accent, isn't it?
3368560	3369560	No, that's good.
3369560	3371560	Bill loves it.
3371560	3372560	Laughing.
3372560	3374560	They're bantering about banking.
3374560	3376560	Dinner ends.
3376560	3379560	And Alessa takes the sister aside.
3379560	3382560	The Scott's sister aside and says,
3382560	3384560	this is him looking at pointing
3384560	3386560	at your dad's direction.
3386560	3387560	I haven't seen my father like this
3387560	3389560	since Edson.
3389560	3391560	End of that summer, Bill,
3391560	3394560	and I'll invite Scott up to the house in Brooklyn.
3394560	3397560	I spent the day drinking and reminiscing.
3397560	3400560	And Bill joked about how he dodged a bullet
3400560	3403560	by not getting the chief risk officer job.
3403560	3406560	He tells Scott that he's about to retire,
3406560	3409560	thinking about retiring for a final time.
3409560	3411560	He keeps saying how much he misses Edson.
3411560	3414560	And he keeps asking Scott for a state planning advice.
3414560	3416560	For a state planning advice.
3416560	3418560	Yes, Scott was mystified by that because...
3418560	3419560	2012?
3419560	3421560	This is summer 2012.
3421560	3423560	Scott asked Bill,
3423560	3425560	what would have happened if with Deutsche,
3425560	3426560	Edson hadn't died?
3426560	3428560	It would be a better worship.
3428560	3430560	We would have made less money during the boom,
3430560	3433560	but we would have lost less money
3433560	3435560	during the bust, he said.
3435560	3437560	Hmm.
3437560	3439560	February 2013,
3439560	3441560	annual bonuses get handed out.
3441560	3444560	Bill asks Anchu for a private meeting.
3444560	3447560	Tells Anchu that he's going to retire again.
3448560	3451560	He's tired, he's deflated.
3451560	3453560	He just wants it out.
3453560	3455560	Anchu is laid,
3455560	3458560	there's a million different fires burning inside Deutsche Bank right then.
3458560	3461560	He convinces your dad to stick around
3461560	3464560	for several more months.
3464560	3466560	The...
3466560	3469560	And there's like everywhere you look,
3469560	3471560	there's scandals, everything,
3471560	3474560	all the shoes sitting in the family right now.
3475560	3476560	Well,
3476560	3479560	I mean, today it's a bit worse.
3479560	3481560	I mean, where were the scandals at the time?
3481560	3483560	There were a lot of scandals.
3483560	3484560	Libor?
3484560	3485560	Libor,
3485560	3487560	Russian merit trading was just bubbling up.
3487560	3488560	Okay.
3488560	3490560	There was a tally that the bank did
3490560	3492560	that identified...
3492560	3493560	I'm trying to find this number.
3493560	3494560	The stress test,
3494560	3495560	or before the stress test?
3495560	3497560	The stress test was beginning the problem.
3497560	3498560	There were,
3498560	3500560	in the first eight months of 2013,
3500560	3503560	there were 5,777 requests
3503560	3504560	for information from regulators,
3504560	3506560	which is about one per hour
3506560	3507560	on average,
3507560	3509560	and that's a very, very bad sign.
3509560	3510560	Okay.
3510560	3511560	There's...
3511560	3512560	The net tech, basket trees.
3512560	3514560	Yeah, the Fed is furious,
3514560	3516560	the CFTC is furious,
3516560	3518560	the SEC is investigating.
3518560	3519560	So it's bubbling.
3519560	3520560	Justice Department is starting
3520560	3522560	a bunch of investigations.
3522560	3523560	It's bubbling at this point.
3523560	3525560	It hasn't really come to fruition.
3525560	3526560	It's...
3526560	3529560	their offices are being raided by police.
3529560	3531560	Yeah, it's pretty bad.
3531560	3532560	It's pretty bad.
3532560	3534560	But you're right, it does get worse.
3537560	3538560	So...
3539560	3540560	Oh, look.
3540560	3541560	We switched back to Val for a second.
3541560	3543560	Oh, joy.
3544560	3546560	Val possessed a man of charisma,
3546560	3548560	and he charmed his way into recording studios
3548560	3550560	and meetings with music industry professionals.
3550560	3552560	His catalogue of the songs expanded.
3552560	3554560	He got gigs.
3554560	3556560	It's less lonely with an audience, he told me.
3558560	3559560	Did you see that?
3559560	3560560	Yep.
3562560	3565560	2008, Urban Plaza.
3565560	3566560	You meet Jenny,
3566560	3567560	selling merchandise up front.
3567560	3568560	Yeah.
3569560	3572560	Start dating, she's from New York.
3572560	3573560	Moved to London,
3573560	3575560	two bedroom flat in Pentishtown.
3575560	3576560	Yeah.
3576560	3577560	Good.
3581560	3583560	Your parents paid the rent
3583560	3586560	and distributed roughly 50 grand a year.
3586560	3587560	Is that right?
3588560	3589560	It was...
3590560	3591560	The rent?
3591560	3592560	I mean, including the rent?
3592560	3593560	No, not including the rent.
3593560	3595560	Oh, yeah, it's about $50,000.
3597560	3599560	I'm noting that
3599560	3603560	you really wanted your dad to respect
3603560	3605560	and that you want to please your dad
3605560	3606560	because that's normal.
3606560	3607560	Of course.
3607560	3608560	Yeah, and it's nothing bad.
3608560	3611560	But he also viewed it as the more...
3611560	3613560	the more he viewed you as responsible,
3613560	3615560	the more he would trust you.
3615560	3616560	And there was...
3616560	3618560	I'm mentioning this...
3618560	3619560	I think this was...
3619560	3621560	What's the film producer again?
3621560	3622560	What's his name?
3622560	3623560	Lawrence.
3623560	3624560	No.
3625560	3626560	Jerecki.
3626560	3627560	Jerecki.
3627560	3629560	So you told Jerecki...
3629560	3631560	I guess I'm also trying to...
3631560	3634560	So you propose investment from your dad
3634560	3635560	into Jerecki's business.
3635560	3637560	And you say to Jerecki?
3637560	3639560	I guess I'm also trying to prove to him
3639560	3641560	that I can make sound and confident choices with money.
3641560	3643560	Yeah, I know this was a...
3644560	3646560	David Gran.
3647560	3650560	I was trying to put Jerecki with David Gran
3650560	3653560	for his other book before it was made into...
3655560	3656560	Velocity of Z.
3656560	3658560	So I was trying to put those two together
3658560	3661560	and then Jerecki wanted something about this...
3661560	3662560	You have the email, right?
3662560	3664560	It should all be in that email.
3664560	3665560	I've got the email.
3665560	3667560	And I was trying to put my dad in the middle too.
3667560	3669560	But yeah, it sounds about right.
3669560	3670560	I mean, close enough.
3670560	3672560	So we begin to hear a little bit
3672560	3674560	about your dad's view of you and money.
3674560	3675560	Okay.
3676560	3678560	Enjoy, yes.
3679560	3680560	You're nuts.
3680560	3681560	Earn more...
3681560	3682560	Sorry.
3682560	3683560	You're nuts.
3683560	3684560	Earn some money, he told you.
3684560	3687560	When you're asked for your stipend to be increased.
3687560	3688560	Yes.
3688560	3695560	Another time your allowance was frittered away somehow
3695560	3697560	and you...
3697560	3701560	He moved on to a weekly payment plan instead of a monthly.
3701560	3703560	Yeah, that was a terrible idea.
3705560	3709560	And I know that Bill, like, was pretty short with you sometimes.
3709560	3710560	Yeah.
3710560	3711560	If you meant to annoy, you succeeded.
3711560	3712560	Yeah.
3712560	3713560	I told you I'm on occasion.
3720560	3722560	I'm not sure you're gonna like this part.
3722560	3725560	I'm noting that you had an unkempt beard
3725560	3729560	and while your shoulder length hair was mingy on the sides,
3729560	3731560	the top was as bald as a coot.
3731560	3732560	It's not that bald.
3732560	3733560	It's pretty fucking tall.
3733560	3734560	I mean, come on.
3734560	3735560	There's still some...
3735560	3736560	That's about as bald as a coot.
3736560	3737560	Some strands.
3737560	3738560	Some strands.
3738560	3740560	Is that what you're gonna call that?
3740560	3741560	Some strands left.
3741560	3744560	I'm saying that your clothes were old and tattered
3744560	3746560	and your friends didn't think they were very stylish.
3746560	3749560	Quote, he looked like a right tramp.
3749560	3750560	One of your...
3750560	3752560	Who was this?
3753560	3754560	This was Simon Saren.
3754560	3756560	Simon said that a fucker.
3756560	3757560	Okay.
3757560	3760560	He said you push, push, push some more.
3761560	3764560	That friends could tell that you had money,
3764560	3766560	they didn't quite know where it came from.
3766560	3767560	You would say your mom was an artist
3767560	3768560	and your dad was a math guy,
3768560	3770560	something about algorithms.
3771560	3772560	I never said that.
3772560	3774560	Well, that sounds about right.
3774560	3776560	I said my dad was a banker.
3776560	3778560	He was a math guy.
3780560	3781560	I mean, he was a math guy.
3781560	3782560	That's not inaccurate.
3782560	3783560	It was just vague.
3783560	3785560	Why would I hide that he's a banker?
3785560	3786560	Well, that was actually interesting.
3786560	3787560	I talked to Simon about that.
3787560	3789560	I asked him that very question.
3789560	3794560	And he said it's just not like a good look in London
3794560	3796560	at that point to be...
3796560	3797560	A banker's son?
3797560	3798560	Yeah.
3799560	3800560	Not a good look.
3800560	3802560	Anyway, he told me a story.
3802560	3804560	It sounds like Simon created his own sort of story.
3804560	3806560	This is kind of going to hurt your street cred.
3806560	3807560	Oh, my street cred.
3807560	3808560	Don't have street cred.
3808560	3809560	Okay.
3809560	3810560	Well, not for long.
3812560	3814560	So Simon agreed to do like a photo shoot
3814560	3818560	for a Bikini Roulette Army cover, album cover.
3818560	3819560	Agreed.
3819560	3822560	Or offered or whatever.
3822560	3823560	Okay.
3823560	3827560	And what he offered was to help make over your wardrobe
3827560	3829560	and get proper clothes for this.
3829560	3830560	Right.
3830560	3833560	And he says that you suggested they go to Harrod's.
3833560	3837560	He said bloody hell and took you to Camden Market.
3837560	3838560	That's right.
3839560	3840560	That's true.
3840560	3841560	I didn't know.
3841560	3843560	I thought Harrod's had some cool shit.
3843560	3845560	What's wrong with Harrod's?
3845560	3847560	I don't know, man.
3847560	3849560	It's not as cool as Camden Market,
3849560	3851560	but Harrod's still nice.
3852560	3855560	If I had a choice between Harrod's and Camden Market,
3855560	3857560	would you go to Harrod's or Camden Market?
3857560	3859560	It depends what look that I try to fill off.
3859560	3861560	I wouldn't go to either, to be honest.
3861560	3862560	I would go to the Gap.
3862560	3863560	To the Gap.
3863560	3867560	So that's a sign of my fashion sense.
3870560	3871560	Okay.
3871560	3874560	So I'm telling the story of how you and Beth met.
3874560	3875560	Yes.
3875560	3878560	At a party in 2011.
3878560	3879560	Yes.
3879560	3881560	She saw you across the room.
3881560	3883560	There was something magnetic about you.
3883560	3885560	She needed to know who this cocky guy was.
3885560	3886560	So sweet.
3886560	3888560	She walked over and started talking.
3888560	3891560	She's captivated, so confident, so brash, so American.
3891560	3892560	Come on, dear.
3892560	3893560	Cheesy.
3893560	3894560	Cheesy.
3894560	3896560	You made a crack about how she looked just like Patty Boyd.
3896560	3897560	She knew who Patty Boyd was,
3897560	3900560	but she was very flattered and she got on and googled it.
3901560	3904560	And by the following spring, so we're in 2012 now,
3904560	3907560	Jenny's had a picture and you and Beth are living together.
3907560	3908560	Yes.
3908560	3910560	She realized that you were a hoarder.
3910560	3911560	A hoarder.
3911560	3912560	A hoarder.
3912560	3913560	Years worth of junk.
3913560	3916560	Ticket stubs, tattered artwork, both clothes.
3916560	3919560	Occupying every drawer and shelf in the apartment.
3919560	3920560	What?
3920560	3921560	That's not true at all.
3921560	3922560	No?
3922560	3923560	That's maybe for books.
3923560	3926560	I kept all these books, but I threw a lot of shit away.
3926560	3927560	Okay.
3927560	3928560	I need to see it.
3928560	3929560	Wow.
3929560	3930560	Excuse me.
3930560	3931560	No.
3931560	3932560	Wow.
3932560	3933560	Amazing.
3933560	3934560	I did not throw...
3934560	3936560	There were some things I did not throw away.
3936560	3937560	I reluctantly corroborate.
3937560	3938560	But not a hoarder.
3938560	3939560	Because images...
3939560	3940560	It's a businessman.
3940560	3944560	When I think of a hoarder, I see that images on television with people stacking up piles
3944560	3945560	in these papers.
3945560	3946560	That's not...
3946560	3947560	Well, we can set up.
3947560	3949560	I mean, I don't know.
3949560	3950560	It's a majority.
3950560	3953560	I mean, it's not a compliment.
3953560	3955560	He's absolutely a hoarder, isn't he?
3955560	3956560	You're not.
3956560	3957560	Thank you.
3957560	3959560	I'm highly confident in the accuracy of that description.
3959560	3960560	She's not exaggerating.
3960560	3961560	Yeah.
3961560	3962560	Good.
3962560	3963560	Here you go, buddy.
3963560	3968560	I'm just trying to find another pack of cigarettes.
3968560	3971560	Here it is.
3971560	3974560	He's actually a very hoarder.
3974560	3978560	He's got, like, city tickets.
3978560	3982560	But he doesn't have stacks of newspapers.
3982560	3983560	Yeah.
3983560	3986560	He keeps every cinema ticket, every note.
3986560	3987560	It's amazing.
3987560	3990560	Well, hey, it's a good way to jog your memory.
3990560	3991560	It's a very good way.
3991560	3992560	Yeah.
3992560	3993560	It's a good way.
3993560	3995560	She says it is fondly, by the way.
3995560	3996560	Okay.
3996560	3999860	She wanted to do things like cook dinner and go out on dates and explore London in the
3999860	4001560	daylight with her boyfriend.
4001560	4009560	Believe it or not, your sleeping habits were not conducive to that, which is maybe a little
4009560	4011560	frustrating to her.
4011560	4019020	One of the things that surprised her about you was that you, at first glance, came across
4019020	4024020	to her as this brash, charismatic, hyper-confident American.
4024020	4026100	And I think maybe I've told you about this.
4026100	4031860	She found you to be extremely anxious, sometimes tongue-tied, by anxiety before performances.
4031860	4039740	And she gave me a specific example of a performance at the 100 Club on Oxford Street, where you
4039740	4046400	wrapped up your set, then shouted into the microphone, someone needs to call me an ambulance.
4046400	4052960	And the crowd looked at you silently, not clear, or not sure if you were serious or not.
4052960	4054160	And then you fled offstage.
4054160	4058480	And Beth, rushed backstage, thinking you were having some sort of breakdown, can't find
4058480	4065440	you, spent a while exploring the labby runth of, I guess, is that club's underground area.
4065440	4068720	And eventually, leaves me, she can't find you.
4068720	4074960	And there, on the sidewalk, you're sitting there sweating, panicked, and unable to speak,
4074960	4075960	she says.
4075960	4077480	And I thought I was going to die.
4077480	4078480	Why?
4078480	4084360	Lane, Lane Hines was playing with me, and Lane had a party the night before.
4084360	4088320	So, well, actually, Lane wasn't scheduled to play with you, I was supposed to play alone,
4088320	4092800	but we went to Lane's house, we had a party, we were up all night, a lot of cocaine, a lot
4092800	4093800	of cocaine.
4093800	4094800	And we did not sleep.
4094800	4098520	And then sometime around 7am, he said, Lane, why don't you join me on stage?
4098520	4101920	He's like, OK, it's cocaine conversation.
4101920	4104520	And then we just decided not to sleep and stay up to the show.
4104560	4110240	So we get to the hunter club, like, at night, cooked up out of our heads with the guitars.
4110240	4115560	And then I start performing, and I was so exhausted, and then not only the anxiety from
4115560	4120320	playing mixed with the cocaine, mixed with the no sleep, I thought I was going to die
4120320	4121320	at the last song.
4121320	4122320	Like, I was singing.
4122320	4124240	I didn't think I was going to finish the song.
4124240	4126920	And so I thought I was going to fall right off the fucking stage and die.
4126920	4127920	So he said, call me an ambulance.
4127920	4128920	And I was dead serious.
4128920	4130920	I thought I was going to die.
4131320	4135120	So I had to go outside and catch my breath and calm down and relax.
4136120	4137120	It's terrible.
4137120	4139120	Well, that matches up pretty well.
4139120	4140120	Yeah.
4140120	4141120	That's your perspective.
4141120	4143120	I've now got both perspectives of them.
4143120	4144120	They mesh.
4144120	4149120	So you and Bill go to Wimbledon.
4149120	4156120	June 2013, lovely picture of you guys together there.
4156120	4159120	Faded Giants hat that couldn't corral your long hair.
4159120	4164720	Half button denim shirt that exposed your chest.
4164720	4170420	Your bearded face projecting too cool for school detachment.
4170420	4181920	You at one point asked Bill, asked your dad, say, tell me about work, and he didn't answer.
4181920	4191720	I'm noting, let's say, going into that suicide at the Swiss insurance company where Ackerman
4191720	4192720	had gone on to.
4192720	4194720	The double murder suicide?
4194720	4195720	No.
4195720	4197720	No, that's a different one.
4197720	4204320	This is the one in fall of 2013, and your dad and some of his friends afterwards are
4204320	4208840	emailing about this one and saying it doesn't look too good for Ackerman because this guy
4208840	4214160	had just hung himself and left a suicide note that blamed Ackerman for putting too much
4214160	4215160	pressure on him.
4215160	4216160	Did it?
4216160	4217160	Yeah.
4217160	4218160	I didn't know this.
4218160	4219160	That's public.
4219160	4220160	I didn't know that.
4220160	4221160	What did they not say?
4221160	4222160	Do you have it in there?
4222160	4223160	I don't.
4223160	4230360	Ackerman then resigned from that company and said, I have reason to believe that the families
4230360	4233640	of the opinion that I should take my share of responsibility.
4233640	4238800	He later told someone that a certain amount of pressure or occasional factual criticism
4238800	4240280	were perfectly normal in such positions.
4240280	4243000	They did not even begin to justify suicide.
4243000	4244000	I remember this.
4244000	4245000	Yes.
4245000	4246000	Okay.
4246000	4247640	The wife had done a campaign.
4247640	4248640	The wife blamed him.
4248640	4249640	Yes.
4249640	4250640	Yes.
4250640	4251640	Okay.
4251640	4252640	So Bill retires.
4252640	4257640	His official last day of work is August 31st.
4257640	4262160	You asked him why he was quitting, and he says, quote, there is really no logical next
4262160	4266520	step for me at DB after board appointment fell through, which is fine.
4266520	4270240	I lasted a lot longer than I thought I would.
4270240	4275080	Anshu hosts a lunch for him with about a dozen people.
4275080	4279640	He gave a little speech, toasted Bill for his work.
4279640	4281320	Afterwards Bill, you welcome to thank him.
4281320	4282920	It's a very nice thing.
4282920	4283920	You know it.
4283920	4287680	Anshu responds, you've made a very important contribution to this institution and to many
4287680	4288680	lives.
4288680	4289680	Thanks.
4289680	4290680	Let's stay in touch.
4291200	4294680	Would you kind of stiffen a slightly distant tone?
4295680	4299680	Well, it's meant for, you know, it's not like a personal note.
4299680	4300680	No, it was.
4300680	4301680	These are personal emails.
4301680	4303680	Oh, that's all I can say.
4305680	4307680	He turns 58.
4307680	4310680	Oh, this is the email I sent you?
4310680	4312680	This is stuff I've gotten from you, yeah.
4312680	4313680	That I sent you?
4313680	4314680	Okay.
4314680	4317680	The only person who's been sending me Bill Brooksman's emails.
4317680	4318680	Okay.
4318680	4319680	Right.
4319680	4321680	I just, for never mind.
4321680	4322680	Sorry.
4325680	4329680	They plan to stay in London another year and do some traveling.
4329680	4331680	I'm getting into just some of that.
4331680	4335680	Oh, noting that they made plans to go to South Africa and then Iran the following spring of
4335680	4336680	2014.
4336680	4337680	Great.
4337680	4340680	Bill tries to learn a little French.
4340680	4343680	He takes some writing classes.
4343680	4348680	He prefers to get his driver's license, experiments in the kitchen.
4348680	4351680	He's enjoying being very lazy and unproductive.
4351680	4354680	He writes to a former colleague.
4354680	4356680	He finds himself drinking more and more.
4356680	4360680	Thanksgiving of 2013, he and his mom fly back to New York.
4360680	4366680	Bill goes to lunch with Saman Maj, who, you know, is net by this point a finance professor
4366680	4367680	at Yale.
4367680	4370680	And Bill complains that he's missing his job.
4370680	4372680	The mark is the adrenaline, the challenge.
4372680	4374680	He asks Saman, how do you manage it?
4374680	4376680	Don't you miss it?
4376680	4380680	And it, Maj says he's found fulfillment in academia and suggests that Bill finds something
4380680	4384680	to do with his life.
4384680	4388680	Instead, Bill remains very immersed, as you know, in DBTCA.
4388680	4395680	And it, which is engulfed in, like, rapidly expanding series of problems.
4395680	4398680	They don't even have a CFO.
4398680	4401680	They're kind of whitewashing these fed stress tests.
4401680	4410680	He pushes, as you know, your dad pushes a lot to, you know, take things more seriously
4410680	4413680	and, like, get up to speed.
4413680	4416680	That does not really seem to be working very well.
4416680	4419680	Like, no one seems to be taking it all that seriously.
4419680	4429680	And, okay, December 2013, you meet your parents for sushi.
4429680	4433680	And this is where we get into the U.S.
4433680	4436680	He asks you what your long-term plans are for all the music.
4436680	4441680	He says how much it would cost to, like, do it all.
4441680	4446680	And for a glorious moment, you think your dad's about to offer to bankroll all of them.
4446680	4449680	Instead, he asks how you'll support yourself when he's gone.
4449680	4451680	You ask, are you sick?
4451680	4458680	Well, I made a joke, too, because I didn't want him to think that I was giving a number to bankroll it.
4458680	4459680	So it's not exactly...
4459680	4461680	I'm not suggesting at all that you're like money broke.
4461680	4462680	No, I made a specific joke.
4462680	4466680	I said $1 billion, because I didn't want him to think that I was, like...
4466680	4468680	Anyway, it doesn't matter.
4468680	4470680	You say, are you sick?
4470680	4471680	He shakes his head.
4471680	4473680	Ola answers, your father is fine.
4473680	4474680	Right.
4474680	4477680	A week or two later, you and Beth go out to dinner with them.
4477680	4491680	That's when you give the Steve Miller band anthology and the record player, which Ola did not like.
4491680	4494680	There's a gospel choir singing in the restaurant.
4494680	4496680	Yeah, that's right.
4496680	4503680	Your dad had actually a really engaging conversation about pop music, which seemed out of character for him, but interesting.
4503680	4504680	Yeah.
4504680	4506680	At the end of the dinner, he hugged you.
4506680	4512680	This is an unusual display of physical affection and says, I love you very much.
4512680	4514680	Hand to a holiday card.
4514680	4517680	Enjoy the holidays here and we'll see you in January.
4517680	4522680	In front of the car, there is a picture of Daisy that Ola had drawn.
4522680	4529680	This little card is blue and white, except for the dog's red leash.
4529680	4531680	Huh.
4531680	4532680	Okay.
4532680	4534680	That month...
4534680	4536680	I didn't pick up on that.
4536680	4538680	Is that right?
4538680	4539680	Take a look.
4539680	4541680	Yeah, I did see it again.
4541680	4543680	It's the only thing that stands out in the card is the red leash.
4543680	4544680	It does, right?
4544680	4546680	Yep.
4546680	4547680	Do you have it?
4547680	4549680	Yeah, I send it to him.
4549680	4551680	I don't know if he sent it to me or if he showed it to me.
4551680	4552680	Yeah, he must have sent it to me.
4552680	4554680	I took a picture of it and emailed it to you.
4554680	4555680	Yeah.
4555680	4556680	Yeah.
4556680	4557680	Wow.
4557680	4559680	I didn't even miss that.
4559680	4561680	That's pretty quick.
4561680	4563680	Yeah.
4563680	4565680	Good catch.
4565680	4575680	So that month, one afternoon, Bill arranged to meet up with Martin Luft, who was his partner back in the olden days at Deutsche Bank,
4575680	4577680	the guy, the military guy.
4577680	4579680	Some people thought he was a special forces.
4579680	4581680	And they agreed to meet at Gales.
4581680	4586680	Gales, that big chain of little cafes and coffee shops in London.
4586680	4587680	Barely.
4587680	4591680	It was kind of a fixture in my neighborhood anyway.
4591680	4592680	And also in Chelsea.
4592680	4595680	And Bill shows up in his gym clothes.
4595680	4596680	He just came from the gym.
4596680	4597680	He's sweaty.
4597680	4600680	And so he's sitting in the crowded cafe reminiscing.
4600680	4609680	And Loat has been, he gave up on the banking industry and is kind of telling Bill about how he's just like happier than he's ever been in his life.
4609680	4618680	He's got like a small house now and he goes to pub quizzes and jogs and skis and just things are simpler.
4618680	4623680	Tries to get your dad enthusiastic about this new phase of his retirement.
4623680	4629680	And Loat can tell that Bill is just like dwelling on things.
4629680	4634680	And at one point he says to Loat that he's wrestling with a problem.
4634680	4638680	And he says the bank had done a trade with a client.
4638680	4641680	The client hadn't fully understood what he'd been getting into.
4641680	4643680	And now there's a big mess.
4643680	4646680	It sounded to Loat a lot like the Orange County.
4646680	4649680	Well, it sounded like that, but you're right.
4649680	4650680	That's very good.
4650680	4655680	This is three weeks before your dad kills himself.
4655680	4658680	He also says...
4658680	4661680	It could be why my dad asked for the Orange County memo again.
4661680	4663680	If this is looming on him.
4663680	4665680	Or it could be Monica DePasque.
4665680	4668680	Because that's really what this sounds like to me.
4668680	4670680	Bill asked Martin what he should do.
4670680	4675680	And Loat, who was not very good at reading people, could tell that Bill was like really upset.
4675680	4682680	And Loat had never forgotten a lesson that Bill had taught him back in their early days together.
4682680	4685680	There was a lesson that Reverend Jack had actually told Bill.
4685680	4690680	Which is that do write by other people, be honest with them, treat them ethically, things will work out in the end.
4690680	4692680	And so he told Bill that.
4692680	4696680	He said, I remember when I had a problem with this back in the early days of Deutsche.
4696680	4698680	This is what you told me and now I'm telling it to you.
4698680	4703680	And Bill looked at him, kind of stared off into the distance, didn't say anything.
4703680	4706680	And there's an awkward silence.
4706680	4710680	I think my father realizes his own...
4714680	4717680	It's the word fallibility in that sentence.
4717680	4719680	His own premature...
4719680	4721680	What's the word?
4721680	4726680	Juvenile understanding of morality.
4726680	4729680	I mean he recognizes his...
4729680	4731680	It's the word.
4731680	4733680	It's a perfect word.
4733680	4735680	It's escaping my mind.
4735680	4738680	Immature understanding of morality.
4738680	4742680	It's very do write by others and they will do write by you.
4742680	4745680	He's learning more and more is not true.
4745680	4748680	It's a lot more grayer than that.
4748680	4751680	I think it might be simpler.
4751680	4755680	I think his whole life is understanding that less, more and more.
4755680	4758680	He is the moral center of everything and he has always been.
4758680	4763680	And more he learns, especially after his father died, who was the...
4763680	4770680	Mr. Moralistic, the pillars of the family and everything else.
4770680	4774680	He realizes that this is a fallacy.
4774680	4778680	We're going to get into some of the stuff with his dad dying a little bit.
4778680	4780680	Just in my chronology.
4780680	4782680	I'm sure to hear Martin Lewis say that to him.
4782680	4785680	He sees his own hubris.
4786680	4788680	My take of...
4788680	4789680	It's really interesting.
4789680	4790680	My dad's not this deep.
4790680	4793680	I mean he's a very bright guy and he knows that something like this,
4793680	4796680	saying this is like putting a band-aid on a fucking...
4796680	4800680	Or maybe he's just deeply upset about whatever...
4800680	4801680	I mean, Loats take away from this.
4801680	4802680	A sword wound.
4802680	4806680	I think was that...
4806680	4808680	Do you get what I'm saying?
4808680	4810680	100% of what you're saying.
4810680	4812680	I'm not being dismissive when I say that.
4812680	4813680	It's really interesting.
4813680	4817680	I hadn't thought about that.
4817680	4821680	So off they go with the girls to Virgin Gorda.
4821680	4823680	But what were you going to say before you think...
4823680	4826680	I just think the simpler explanation, which isn't necessarily the right one,
4826680	4827680	is that...
4827680	4831680	But the one that was in my head is that...
4831680	4836680	Bill is really worried about a transaction or transaction
4836680	4840680	that the bank has done with a client that are now boomeranging back at them.
4840680	4843680	And he's worried about his culpability in that.
4843680	4844680	That's too simple.
4844680	4848680	Because what we know now is that McKaylee Faisola did this transaction.
4848680	4850680	Well, we don't know what's Monodiposki, by the way.
4850680	4851680	That's an assumption.
4851680	4853680	Well, I mean, what else could it be?
4853680	4855680	Look, we'll get into what Bill knew about Monodiposki.
4855680	4856680	Basket trades are over.
4856680	4857680	Library's over.
4857680	4858680	Well, in fact, hang on.
4858680	4859680	What else is going on?
4859680	4860680	No, they're not over.
4860680	4861680	Well, I mean...
4861680	4862680	No, hang on.
4862680	4864680	We can do this right now if you want.
4864680	4869680	In fact, the Monodiposki investigation was scheduled
4869680	4876680	to begin on Monday, January 27th.
4876680	4877680	Really?
4877680	4878680	Yes.
4878680	4879680	Monday, January 27th.
4879680	4880680	Yeah.
4880680	4881680	So what is that?
4881680	4882680	One day after your death?
4882680	4883680	It's the Monday.
4883680	4884680	Yeah, it's the day after.
4884680	4887680	Libor was not anywhere near done at that point.
4887680	4891680	In fact, what had happened with Libor is that a bunch of people had just been arrested
4891680	4894680	in the UK because of Libor.
4894680	4895680	Right.
4895680	4896680	And anyway, let's get...
4896680	4897680	We'll come back to that.
4897680	4898680	So you're...
4898680	4899680	Do you think that...
4899680	4900680	That means anything?
4900680	4901680	I think your dad was...
4901680	4903680	No, I mean, the investigation is starting on 27.
4903680	4905680	Do you see anything in that?
4905680	4906680	It's a hell of a coincidence.
4906680	4911680	It is, right?
4911680	4912680	They got into broken board.
4912680	4915680	But what we know is that Faisola handled this trade.
4915680	4917680	And my dad, we know for a fact that he went to Anchu...
4917680	4918680	Let's come back to that.
4918680	4920680	And he said no about this trade.
4920680	4921680	He said no.
4921680	4923680	And Faisola went around his back.
4923680	4926680	He went around my dad's back and ran Anchu's back.
4926680	4927680	He did not...
4927680	4930680	He did not go through the proper channels.
4930680	4933680	Faisola has a very different take on that.
4933680	4934680	And...
4934680	4935680	No shit.
4935680	4936680	He's under 16 fucking indictments from law.
4936680	4937680	And he's gonna...
4937680	4938680	Yeah, but that stuff is just nonsense.
4938680	4939680	It's not nonsense.
4939680	4940680	It's not nonsense.
4940680	4941680	It's not nonsense.
4941680	4942680	Well, because Italian...
4942680	4943680	I hear what you're saying.
4943680	4944680	Okay.
4944680	4945680	There's...
4945680	4946680	As long as I'm clear.
4946680	4947680	Okay.
4947680	4948680	You're clear.
4948680	4950680	But look, what we can stipulate here is that your dad killed himself.
4950680	4951680	Right?
4951680	4952680	We know that.
4952680	4955680	And we know that he was worried about stuff at work.
4955680	4959680	And so it's not a question of was he worried about stuff at work.
4959680	4960680	We know he was.
4960680	4962680	But you're saying he's worried about his own culpability.
4962680	4963680	And I'm saying...
4963680	4964680	I'm not saying that.
4964680	4965680	I'm saying...
4965680	4966680	Yeah, you just said that he was...
4966680	4970680	He expressed his worry about how culpable he was in whatever this trade may be.
4970680	4973680	And I'm saying that he's not culpable in anything, as we all know.
4973680	4974680	I'm not saying he's culpable.
4974680	4979680	I mean, looking back, again, hindsight, there's absolutely nothing putting him in any terrible
4979680	4983680	trades or any kind of money laundering schemes or basket trades.
4983680	4984680	I'm not saying he's culpable.
4984680	4986680	I'm saying he's worried he's culpable.
4986680	4989680	But he knows he's not culpable, because he knows he has done nothing wrong.
4989680	4991680	So that worries the paradox.
4991680	4995680	Well, we'll come back to that, because we know the way his psychologist...
4995680	4997680	What he told his psychologist and his doctor also.
4997680	4998680	Okay.
4998680	4999680	But we're going to come back to all of this.
4999680	5000680	Okay.
5000680	5001680	I promise.
5001680	5002680	They go off to Virgin Gorda in the Caribbean.
5002680	5005680	They spend a couple of days at a resort.
5005680	5007680	And then go with...
5007680	5013680	During which, when Bill phones into a board meeting about problems with the Fed, then they
5013680	5018680	join Michael Morandy, his wife and some others, and the Morandy's 47-foot sailboat.
5018680	5019680	They swim.
5019680	5020680	They snorkel.
5020680	5021680	They drink.
5021680	5022680	They smoke.
5022680	5023680	They run up cigarettes.
5023680	5024680	They search boats.
5024680	5025680	They ask for a half-soaked cigarette.
5025680	5026680	They drink some more.
5026680	5029680	Your mom tries to convince Bill to buy a sailboat.
5029680	5031680	Bill kind of goes along with it.
5031680	5034680	New Year's Day, motorboat takes them to the airport.
5034680	5039680	Bill gets sick and pukes.
5040680	5045680	And at this time, a couple of your dad's friends who've been spending time with him started
5045680	5049680	looking, thinking that it was a little weird that they didn't...
5049680	5052680	They felt that they didn't know your dad that well.
5052680	5053680	They knew him.
5053680	5062680	He's a great friend, a loyal friend, like a brilliant, ethical, fascinating, but they
5062680	5063680	didn't know him.
5063680	5064680	They didn't know his emotions.
5064680	5067680	And some of this, I think, is probably just men being men, right?
5067680	5068680	Right.
5068680	5074680	This is something that more than one friend, very close friend, who I talked to said.
5074680	5079680	And they used words like, they didn't really know him.
5079680	5080680	Not an emotional level.
5080680	5081680	Yeah, but you know what?
5081680	5082680	Whatever.
5082680	5083680	It's just a bunch of bullshit.
5083680	5085680	Because everyone thinks they know someone.
5085680	5089680	And then when someone does something unexpected, like a suicide, you look back and think,
5089680	5091680	I never really knew the guy, because I didn't see that coming.
5091680	5092680	No, it's not that.
5092680	5094680	If somebody saw it coming, they could say, oh, I knew him well.
5094680	5095680	I saw it coming.
5095680	5096680	Fair enough.
5096680	5097680	Right?
5097680	5098680	No, I don't think it's quite that simple.
5098680	5099680	But fair enough.
5099680	5102680	I think it's quite, I think it is that simple.
5102680	5103680	They get back to London.
5103680	5104680	And they distance themselves from this person.
5104680	5107680	Oh, I didn't know this person, because I did not see this person.
5107680	5109680	They're not saying that in that context.
5109680	5111680	They're not saying, oh, I didn't see this person.
5111680	5112680	Of course, it's all in that context.
5112680	5113680	You're right.
5113680	5115680	I mean, I'm obviously talking to all these people.
5115680	5116680	Yes, in that context.
5116680	5118680	In the context of them having killed themselves a few weeks later.
5118680	5119680	Right.
5119680	5120680	But let's just leave it.
5120680	5121680	I hear what you're saying.
5121680	5122680	Okay.
5122680	5123680	Yeah.
5123680	5128680	Come back to London.
5128680	5132680	He tells Ola that they're going to New York for another DVD sale.
5132680	5133680	Board meeting.
5133680	5135680	They're going to do the wills.
5135680	5140680	He tells Ola that he has to meet with the feds when he's there.
5140680	5143680	That, I think, has been kind of mis-transposed.
5143680	5145680	And he actually meant meet with the fed.
5145680	5146680	Capital F.
5146680	5147680	Right.
5147680	5149680	Because he'd been having phone conversations with the fed.
5149680	5151680	Is this the Mark Stein stuff?
5151680	5152680	No.
5152680	5153680	That's not Mark Stein.
5153680	5154680	This is separate.
5154680	5157680	And this is, we'll come back to this.
5157680	5161680	So, I just told you, Monty Deposky has collapsed at this point.
5161680	5163680	Faisal, their criminal investigation is in Italy.
5163680	5168680	The Germans are about to start a big new investigation on Monday, January 27th.
5168680	5169680	Okay.
5169680	5170680	Friday, January 24th.
5170680	5174680	Anshu is in Davos partying.
5174680	5178680	The world is good.
5178680	5181680	My favorite line in the book is in this section.
5181680	5186680	And it describes the party that Deutsche Bank threw hours before your dad killed himself.
5186680	5187680	In Davos?
5187680	5188680	Yeah.
5188680	5189680	And I was there.
5189680	5190680	You were there?
5190680	5191680	Yeah.
5191680	5193680	With Anshu and his wife.
5193680	5198680	And it's a happy scene.
5198680	5200680	Anshu's wife really humanizes him.
5200680	5206680	Ackerman is there and making peace after this huge violent falling out.
5206680	5208680	Bald men's heads.
5208680	5210680	Bald men's heads shine with sweat.
5210680	5213680	Which I just obsessed with that line.
5213680	5215680	Party goes into the early hours of the following morning.
5215680	5216680	Is that your line?
5216680	5217680	Yeah, that's mine.
5217680	5218680	That's pretty good.
5218680	5219680	I thought that was Anshu's.
5219680	5221680	I figured it was quitting Anshu.
5221680	5222680	Okay.
5222680	5226680	A few hundred miles to the northwest.
5226680	5228680	Dance with sweat.
5228680	5230680	Bill and Alde go out to dinner.
5230680	5231680	I could improve on it just a little bit.
5231680	5234680	Bald heads men dance with sweat.
5234680	5236680	Bill and Alde go out to dinner.
5236680	5237680	It's a no.
5237680	5241680	And then for the final time he falls asleep.
5241680	5243680	And sorry, is that it again?
5243680	5245680	For the final time he falls asleep.
5245680	5246680	Okay.
5246680	5247680	Wait, what was the line before that?
5247680	5248680	I'm not reading it.
5248680	5249680	You didn't hear it.
5249680	5252680	There was no line before it as far as I thought.
5252680	5254680	Okay, can we take a break for a sec?
5254680	5255680	Yeah.
5255680	5256680	Okay.
5256680	5258680	This is in part one.
5258680	5259680	Yeah.
5259680	5263680	That was more an emotionally exhausting than I thought.
5263680	5264680	Okay.
