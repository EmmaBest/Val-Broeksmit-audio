1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, can you hear me? David?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's your station name?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I think we're all good.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A little louder?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't want it louder.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Uh, January 26th, 2019.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That is today.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Five years since your death, Seth.

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How are you feeling?

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Uh, shitty.

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a terrible day, of course.

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So...

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How about you?

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What is it that you ever experienced?

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know.

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know what's been on your brain.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Five years.

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Do you, like, think about the five years?

22
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Like, these annual anniversaries are the most important days to you?

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Of course.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Of course, I dread them.

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't like this day.

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a terrible day.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not only because my dad's death,

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and I have to think about it all over again,

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
because I know there's no one I can call or talk to.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My sisters and my family are all doing something.

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And they are, uh, you know, I'm excluded from all that.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So I usually just go out and try and take my mind off of it various ways.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Like, tonight we have a party scheduled.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So...

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I remember on the first anniversary,

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
uh, Andrew did something nice.

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He didn't know that his screening for the Jinx was on the 26th.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, he didn't know the significance of the 26th,

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
so he invited me to his screening.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I was during the Sony hack,

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and that was why I flew from San Francisco to LA to do that.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just take my mind off of it.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The next year, 2015, was pretty miserable.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Um, I spent that at this...

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Uh, sorry, 2016 was pretty shitty,

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
because I spent that in some hotel room in New York.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Pretty high.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Um, 2017, that was when I met Glenn on that day.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And then in 2018, I was, I think, a hibernation point for most of January last year.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then here we are today.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But around that same time is when we contact each other again to do this project.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So that was something that always kind of happens around then.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Um, you were around.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You came out...

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I came out, I think it was like a week or two later last year.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What was it?

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think it was early February, yeah.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I don't think, I think it was late January.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But we'll...

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Maybe, it definitely wasn't the 26th,

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
because I think I would have remembered that.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But I think it was around the 26th when you called and said something about the book.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, that was a bit later.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Um...

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Anyway...

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, it's just miserable time.

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I mean, what do you want?

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm just...

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, no, you mentioned it all.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a reminder, I haven't solved the mystery as well.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I haven't figured out what happened.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Um...

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, thank you for spending the day with me.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you for flying out here to, to force it into me that this is definitely the day

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
my dad killed himself and wanted to be here and get this on camera for whatever you have

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
planned for this.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's very, very kind of you.

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want to come out to see you.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How about January 26th, pal?

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What do you think about that day?

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I mean, it's kind of fun.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But it's not, but it's fun.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, I like your smirk.

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't worry.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't forget about the camera, dude.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm just...

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You and I here.

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We're here, buddy.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's try and pretend that there's no camera.

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Although it's impossible to do so at some level.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But if we don't like this, we can delete it.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let me try again.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, for sure, man.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's...

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me go get the computer.

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay.

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you want any more coffee?

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No?

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let me find out when you came last time.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm pretty sure it was in January.

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was in January.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Dude, I'm Rick 2017.

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Enrich.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Enrich, sorry, 2018.

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I call you by your German proper pronunciation.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I still say Mueller instead of Muller as well.

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
January 18th, you came out...

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:59,000
February 1st.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, you came out actually around after my birthday.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Between the 26th and the 14th.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I sent you this on the 25th.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The thugs.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why am I...

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why is this doing this?

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And yes.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And then I sent you my dad's note to me on the 25th of last year.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So that was after you came.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't think so.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you remember this?

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
For some reason, my...

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just doing this weird thing with the emails where they're stacking them up, cancel.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, on the 25th of January, I sent you my dad's note to me.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, but I think that was before I came out here.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sure.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, I'm not sure.

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It doesn't really matter.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, just for my sense of memory.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All right, should we get going there?

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sorry?

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, so picking up basically where we left off.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Which was, what was the last thing we did?

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yesterday.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you were in Maine at Sydney's Place and you recorded music.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You recorded.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, Sydney's got this great place, like a lair.

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not even an apartment.

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's like this beautiful penthouse with the stairs going up to the...

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's like an evil James Bond villain lair.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's incredible.

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And the great sound, great acoustics in there.

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But yeah, and Sydney was a sort of sweetheart, but she really was very, very kind.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So she let me stay there and she wasn't there.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, so at this point you've gotten into your mom's emails.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And you've started, like, piecing stuff together.

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And it, so one of the things you find in there are all these email chains involving the

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
coroner's inquest.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Right.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And your dad's death.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And this is pretty important.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not sure if you recognize how important it was at the time, but it's...

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So we find a few things.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:28,000
One is that we can see in there all of the, like, what the first doctor prescribed.

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And we can also see...

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is it the way they're in?

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't know.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's sleeping pills or Xanax.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Right.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There's...

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And he also refers him to the psychologist, Dr. Mitchell.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And so the coroner said, or the coroner asks both the, like, the physician and the psychologist

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
what lay about his state of mind.

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And so we've got that he explained.

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He was being investigated by the U.S. and the European courts.

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He was extremely anxious.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We've got...

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So that's from Moore.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But it's really Mitchell that is, in a lot of ways, more interesting.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So it recounts how, what he had talked about when he visited and mentioned his career,

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
his problems, his anxieties, his love for his two daughters.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And that, quote, he was suffering from high levels of anxiety related to investigations

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
into the LIBOR allegations by the U.S. and the U authorities.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He was catastrophizing, imagining worst case outcomes, including prosecution,

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
loss of his wealth, and reputation.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Allen Cloats.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So that, yeah, he still wants Allen Cloats at his party.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, yeah, no, but he still wants Allen Cloats at his party.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, despite LIBOR?

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Despite LIBOR.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, okay, let's, yeah.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So he's catastrophizing, imagining worst case outcomes, including prosecution,

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
loss of his wealth, and reputation, he's sleeping badly.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And again, this is still quoted from the letter.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He's constantly preoccupied by those concerns.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
His self-esteem and normal resilience have been greatly undermined as being named a person of interest

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
in the LIBOR case and in the EU investigation.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then as he leaves Mitchell, Dr. Mitchell gives him his cell phone and asks him to call

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and office, then calls, bills, several times that fall, try to submit an appointment,

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and he never calls back.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, okay.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There's a couple ways to look at it.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If you look at it, face value, it can mean exactly that, right?

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now, if you know my father, he wasn't one for psychiatrists.

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He didn't go see psychiatrists.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It wasn't his thing.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He didn't go to therapy.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He was not a therapy type person.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yep.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Very rarely he would go.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And if he did, it was for a purpose.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And that would be, in my own humble opinion, is to get Xanax, to get drugs.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because he probably has some anxiety.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is a psychologist, not a psychiatrist.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This isn't the one the physician prescribed the drugs.

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is not someone who would prescribe drugs.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is not a prescriber.

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is a psychologist.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So Mitchell is not the prescriber.

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Moore is the prescriber.

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mitchell is a psychologist, so not someone who would prescribe anything.

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, then maybe take it at face value.

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I just don't understand why he would go and see this guy once or twice.

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I mean, without.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But sometimes you need to see a psychiatrist to get to the prescriber.

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Right.

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But this isn't a psychiatrist.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So I'm sorry.

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sometimes you need to see a therapist to get to the physician.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So Moore prescribes, Moore is the physician.

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sure.

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And prescribes a bunch of stuff.

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay.

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And then refers him to a psychologist to kind of talk through his problems.

240
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And, which he does.

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Once.

243
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Once.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Once.

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah.

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's it.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah.

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So he goes to the doctor, gets the medications, the doctor says,

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
give you the medications on contingency that you go to the physician.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, we have no reason to think it was a contingency.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't understand what the issue is here.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you, you feel like.

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't see my dad going into a therapist once and laying all this upon this guy for.

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You think he just made it up?

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, I don't think he made it up.

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I think he uses a tool for something else, which I suspect was to get sanics, but you're

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
telling me this is not the prescriber.

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So perhaps the doctor said on contingency of seeing the therapist, I will give you these

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
drugs.

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you talk to someone else.

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why is it so hard to believe that maybe he just wanted someone to talk to him?

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because he would have gone back or he would have continued this relationship.

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean, he has, I could see him.

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's like, I don't, I don't negate that position that you're taking him.

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Of course, it's good to have someone to talk to and the rest of the families are all

268
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
psychiatrist anyway, but he never did.

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But why go in for one day just to say this shit and then not come back?

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know.

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If he found it there, maybe he just didn't find a therapy at all.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Maybe he tried and thought it was ridiculous or maybe he heard himself say this stuff out

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
loud and thought, oh my God, I am catastrophizing.

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This is ridiculous.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, except that we know that a few months later he kills himself.

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So it's not, I think we can probably stipulate that your dad was like really hurt inside.

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I mean, I don't take any original discount.

278
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No, I don't.

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like he said, he's a psychologist.

280
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't want to discount it.

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I just don't think it's a smoking gun.

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Um, okay.

283
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, do you know what I mean?

284
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, I definitely know what you mean.

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I mean, I don't know about a smoking gun, but it's like.

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If you've been treating this therapist for a year and this is the therapist, the summation

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
of his condition, then yes, okay, that could be more of a smoking gun.

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But if he goes in one time and says this shit.

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know, man.

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This isn't a diagnosis.

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Come down with another guy for sanics at the same time and get some drugs.

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I mean, who knows?

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, but this isn't, he's not like diagnosing your dad and saying your dad was depressed

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
or your dad was, had an anxiety disorder.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
He's saying that your dad.

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because he can't diagnose.

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's not.

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Right, no.

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He's not a psychiatrist.

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He cannot.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So he can only write.

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No, no, no.

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I think this is his way of diagnosing without saying this is what I think.

304
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Psychologists can make diagnoses.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They just can't prescribe drugs.

306
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I also think this guy with psychology thinks he's like a therapist.

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No, he's a psychologist.

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He's a doctor.

309
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He's with a doctor?

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes.

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay.

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He has a PsyD, as they would call it in America, which is a doctorate in psychology.

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He's a doctor.

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

316
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's, look, but he's not trying to do a diagnosis.

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He only met the guy once.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's why I'm insisting to this.

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But he's explaining literally what your dad said to him.

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, but that's the disconnect, David, because we know that there was absolutely no reason

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
for him to be culpable any of these in Liber or in Forex trading or any of the scams that

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Deutsche Bank was running.

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,660
We know that this was a paradox that he had, fear of being culpable, but knowing he was

324
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
not culpable.

325
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,000
That's by definition what the test refers to.

326
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Okay.

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I mean, and again, it's not.

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No one else said this.

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No, it's not true.

330
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Who else said it?

331
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The doctor said the physician.

332
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No.

333
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean, none of his friends.

334
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We'll get there, because yes, they do.

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They do?

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah.

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay.

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And look, we've already gone over this yesterday, but the Martin Loat had a very similar type.

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I mean, it wasn't about this specifically, but it was, and that's even closer.

340
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's in December 2013.

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's just a month before your dad dies.

342
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So we know that from a number of sources at this point, we know from the physician, we

343
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
know from the psychologist, we know from Martin Loat, and we know from the Paul Weiss lawyers

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
who visited, remember who visited in London and sensed that he was really upset and terrified

345
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
about this investigation.

346
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So around the phone call in the airport.

347
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Right, exactly.

348
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So I mean, we have a pretty, that's four independent data sources that we now have that show that

349
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
one's leading up to his death.

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I just don't know if that equates to suicide.

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean, I, there's, my dad was 50.

352
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
58.

353
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
57, actually.

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He turned 58.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He turned 58.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He turned 58.

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah.

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So.

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, okay.

362
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Sorry.

363
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But my point is, he has been through this before.

364
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He's been in these positions of stress.

365
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is what he chose for his life, his work to be in his stressful positions, because

366
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
he managed it very well.

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He's a risk fucking manager.

368
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He could just substitute the word stress for risk.

369
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Right.

370
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's what he did.

371
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So I mean, I don't see.

372
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That is one of the things I find interesting.

373
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, but we know he did commit suicide.

374
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So it's, there's, but there's a possibility of false equivalency.

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What do you mean?

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He just says, you know, I don't equivocate, equivocate that to suicide.

377
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He said, but we know he did commit suicide.

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Right.

379
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're right.

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That doesn't automatically mean that that's what caused it.

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But there's, let's keep going.

382
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I understand.

383
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You know what I mean?

384
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I do.

385
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've been resisting to this since 2014.

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I know you have.

387
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And that's really interesting to me because there's, I mean, look, just to be like personal

388
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
about this, like I come from a family.

389
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
My mom's a psychologist.

390
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Like, you know, I've seen therapists over the years.

391
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I, to me, that's not, there's no like stigma in my brain about people who need help because

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
they're going through a struggle.

393
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They're struggling.

394
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Like sometimes it's an illness.

395
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Sometimes it's just like a tough time to go through.

396
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There's overwhelming evidence here that your dad was going through a really tough time

397
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and that he was what he was like communicating to the people around him was that the, a lot,

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,000
maybe not all of the toughness, but a lot of it was because he was really anxious about

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
stuff that was going on at work.

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And I mean, again, that's really clear.

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I mean, yes, I don't disregard that.

402
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't disregard that.

403
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I accept that.

404
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Holy, but I just don't, I just, there's something that has to cross the line to suicide.

405
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Clearly.

406
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't see that yet.

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

408
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So, okay, well, let's keep going.

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I mean, I think your theory is that it's just compounds and compounds and compounds and

410
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
at some point there's a line that crosses or something breaks and then the suicide.

411
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And then you lead the path to suicide.

412
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I just don't see the breaking point yet.

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I haven't found it.

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean, maybe it's the work stuff compounding with family stuff.

415
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You know, maybe, because my mom, of course, is not the easiest person to deal with either.

416
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think you're thinking about this.

417
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't look too literal away.

418
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Or, you know, I'm not the easiest person to deal with.

419
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You know, my sister, there could be a bunch of shit compounded, but I just don't see the

420
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
line.

421
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't see where it broke.

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And if you're bringing up in August of 2013, he's asking Scott Mitchell about estate planning.

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I mean, you're alluding to the fact that he's already considering suicide at this point.

424
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't know about that.

425
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Why are you bringing it up?

426
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I didn't bring it up.

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're dead.

428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You brought it up in the book.

429
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why else did you put it into the book?

430
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Because it seems relevant.

431
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It seems relevant.

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It seems relevant.

433
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Right.

434
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because you are alluding to the fact that he's considering ending his life by this point in

435
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
time.

436
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He's thinking about his demise.

437
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't think he's necessary.

438
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I mean, I don't know what is going on.

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I said, all I know, I unfortunately never met your dad.

440
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And there's, so all I can do is look at the available evidence that people have talked

441
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to and the documentary evidence that you've compiled and shared with me.

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Anyway, so let's keep, I understand what you're saying.

443
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's fine.

444
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We don't need to go into resolution numbers.

445
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Okay.

446
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, okay.

447
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
To me actually, obviously it's very interesting that the glimpse of a right into your dad's

448
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
state of mind.

449
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But what's more interesting to me, where I was kind of heading with this, is that it's

450
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Deutsche Bank's efforts to cover up what actually happened.

451
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay.

452
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So the coroner schedules this inquest for March 25th.

453
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

454
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
A few days beforehand, she informs the bank and its lawyers and the lawyers that the bank

455
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
has hired for your family.

456
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And she says how she's going to conduct the hearing.

457
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And among other things, she's going to read aloud portions of the doctor's letters to

458
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
both the physician and-

459
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And you were there this year?

460
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, I wasn't at the coroner's.

461
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, Jenny was there?

462
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No, I can't remember who was there.

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But it doesn't matter.

464
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is all coming from documents that you've showed me.

465
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay.

466
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So we know that she is planning to read aloud portions of these letters about the include,

467
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that are primarily about the anxiety of your dad's suffering.

468
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh, right.

469
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Relate to the government.

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There was a controversy because he said the coroner revealed the history of depression

471
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
in the family.

472
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, but that's, again, that's not really what I'm interested in.

473
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What I'm interested in, I'll tell you.

474
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So noon on March 24th, so this is the day before the hearing that's supposed to occur, someone

475
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
in the coroner's office, her name is Fiona Wilkner, someone in her office calls one of the lawyers

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that the bank has hired, informs the lawyer that there will be no reference whatsoever

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
to Bill being under investigation.

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's a quote.

479
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Say that one more time.

480
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There will be, quote, no reference whatsoever to Bill being under investigation.

481
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Okay.

482
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So that night, March 24th, Wilcox, who's a coroner, she spends the evening looking at

483
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the files, going over the inquest files, and she concludes that her obligation is to the

484
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
truth and not to the bank and not to the family, and that therefore she needs to tell the court

485
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
everything that's known about the circumstances of his death.

486
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And that includes the fact that he was very scared about these investigations.

487
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And so the next morning, she arrives at the Royal Court of Justice, meets with the lawyers

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
for your family and for Deutsche Bank, and tells them that she is in fact going to be

489
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
quoted from the doctor's letters extensively.

490
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay.

491
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So the lawyers, and seems like they went kind of bananas and they protest that we had just

492
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
been told the opposite the previous day, and quote, she reminded, so one of the lawyers

493
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
there sums this up.

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
She says she, being the coroner, reminded me that by law she was under a duty to investigate

495
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
all deaths, fearlessly and without favor.

496
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Ultimately, though, it seems that the lawyers kind of wore her down because she agrees

497
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
to a compromise.

498
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And the compromise is that she's going to read the doctor's letters aloud in court,

499
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
but she's going to read a censored or modified edited version.

500
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Right.

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And so what the lawyers do-

502
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The redacted one, I see.

503
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, well, it's like weird.

504
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
They take a pink highlighter and they cross stuff out.

505
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And so-

506
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I see in both versions.

507
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
They're unredacted.

508
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Absolutely in both versions.

509
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So let me just go through how this looks to someone who hasn't been immersed in this.

510
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So he told the psychologists they had been named as a person of interest.

511
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's cut.

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay.

513
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Where Mitchell had written that Bill, quote, imagined being investigated, being prosecuted,

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
losing his wealth in his reputation, those words get crossed out and they're replaced

515
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
with, he imagined, various issues.

516
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay.

517
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Moore's letter, so Moore's the physician.

518
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's described that Bill had, quote, was worried about going to prison or going to bankrupt

519
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
even though he knew he was innocent.

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He kept on thinking back over all the thousands of emails he sent over the years.

521
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He knew how lawyers can twist things around and was worried that they would take extract from

522
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
emails.

523
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So that's a quote from Moore's letter.

524
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's all deleted and replaced with the following sentences.

525
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, okay.

526
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Quote, he told me that he'd been extremely anxious.

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He explained he was retiring in September.

528
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So in other words, these fairly clear explanations about what had been going on inside or what

529
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
your dad had told the doctor and the psychologist or crossed out and it basically replaced with

530
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
this very sterile language that just says he was anxious.

531
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
As if the bank, as if the bank got in there with that pink highlighter.

532
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The bank do get in there with the highlighter.

533
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah.

534
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Those were lawyers hired by the bank.

535
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
To do that.

536
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Well, I don't know.

537
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
She caved, she caved.

538
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah, she caved.

539
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And so the...

540
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I didn't know that.

541
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I didn't know that the bank commissioned that pink highlighter.

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes.

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I didn't know that.

544
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I mean, the lawyers are ostensibly, some of them are ostensibly working on your family's

545
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
behalf and they're paid for it by the bank.

546
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Christian suit, saving.

547
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What was that?

548
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Suit.

549
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Seven.

550
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What about him though?

551
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Once he's suing.

552
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Because he was the lead lawyer at that time.

553
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah, but well, was he at that time?

554
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm not sure he was at that.

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't think he had...

556
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Remember the memo?

557
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No, but that's a year later.

558
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay.

559
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And we're going to get there, don't worry.

560
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay.

561
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But so to me, put this in bucket one, which is that this is pretty clear evidence of...

562
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes.

563
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

564
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean, it really is.

565
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They're taking this very clear language from two doctors who say this is what you got.

566
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, I got it.

567
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You're right.

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I didn't know that they did that.

569
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I thought that was something that the...

570
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I thought they wanted to stay neutral, the corner, and like they didn't want to...

571
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They just wanted...

572
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The point was he killed himself and they were just trying to say he's dead and this is our

573
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
report, nothing to do with the reasons why they didn't want to get into that.

574
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If you go through these emails that went back and forth, they explained in great detail exactly

575
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
how this went down.

576
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I didn't know that.

577
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay.

578
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, show me that.

579
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You forgot.

580
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
No, no.

581
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Between the bank and Wilcox.

582
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
No, no, no.

583
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's not.

584
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's the memos that go back and forth that you fished out of your mom's files.

585
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh, I thought you had something between the bank and Wilcox.

586
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The lawyers are hired by the bank.

587
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I know about communications between Wilcox and the bank.

588
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We have reports that you showed me that show the lawyer.

589
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I know those reports.

590
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I mean something additional to that.

591
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No, that's from there, man.

592
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Oh, I know.

593
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay.

594
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So next, let's move on.

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So why was your dad so worried about the live one investigation?

596
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It is an obvious question, right?

597
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
He said this to both doctors and the bank obviously seems like it does not want that coming out

598
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
in the court.

599
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So why?

600
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why was he so scared?

601
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So this brings us to Mark Stein.

602
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So you found in your dad's files an email from Mark Stein.

603
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He's the lawyer at Simpson Thatcher, which is a very high price corporate law firm.

604
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And you can tell that your father is pretty worried.

605
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He keeps asking or at least on one or two occasions asks Stein what's going on with DOJ.

606
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Stein replies total silence.

607
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He's a slippery fuck.

608
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That guy called me a few times.

609
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, tell him.

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I told you, remember?

611
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I did not.

612
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I called him a few times and I asked to talk to him.

613
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I said, hello.

614
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Very sorry to hear about your dad.

615
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
There was absolutely nothing going on with him.

616
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He wasn't under any investigations.

617
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
When we called him in, it was just sort of like a cattle call.

618
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You know, sometimes these regulators, they're calling thousands of bankers at a time.

619
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
They're looking for stuff.

620
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And that's all that this was about.

621
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And I said to him, excuse me, but I have fucking emails between you two saying, please send me this file

622
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
because it's important.

623
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And then he stopped communicating.

624
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And then he never calls me back.

625
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Wait, no.

626
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And then I call him again and I say, well, can we talk about Faisola and Mikaela Faisola?

627
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And he says, yes, I'd love to talk about this.

628
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Let's set up a date and time.

629
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Phone tag for three fucking months.

630
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
No response.

631
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Emails.

632
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, he clearly did not want to talk to you.

633
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So I think you already know this, but the reason your dad was involved in this live or investigation

634
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
is not that he had done anything.

635
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
He hadn't participated in any fraud or manipulation.

636
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Chief risk guy.

637
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
No, it's that he missed something.

638
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, really?

639
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah.

640
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So back in 2009, Christian Bittar, who was a big live or trader.

641
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I remember this from your book.

642
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah.

643
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Well, I don't think this was actually in the book.

644
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
There's another Deutsche Bank guy, Gio Madoff.

645
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh, no, I remember this from your search terms.

646
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes.

647
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yes.

648
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That's right.

649
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So Bittar back in 2009 was due.

650
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And Anshu Jain had agreed.

651
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Wasn't he recently arrested?

652
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He was recently sentenced to jail.

653
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Sent to jail?

654
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

655
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So he pleaded guilty to fraud.

656
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So he, at the time, though, Anshu Jain had worked at a very lucrative contract for Christian Bittar.

657
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This is, again, back 10 years ago.

658
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He was the one from his desk when it was like 500 million?

659
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

660
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
They were making an absolute killing.

661
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Anshu had agreed to a compensation arrangement where Bittar would basically take home a portion of his winnings.

662
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And so he won a lot.

663
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
In part, Bittar's obviously was manipulating.

664
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
What's his percentage?

665
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't know what the percentage was off the top of my head, but I do know what he was owed, roughly.

666
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So he was due to get a bonus in the neighborhood of 50 or 60 or 70 million dollars.

667
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Wow.

668
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's about 5%.

669
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That was...

670
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It was about 500 million, wasn't it?

671
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, so that'd be 10%.

672
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think it probably was about 10%.

673
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But I'm not certain about that.

674
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
In any case, that's a huge amount of money to just hand out to a trader.

675
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And so there were a couple of reviews that were started internally into...

676
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
People were kind of dispatched to look at how he had made all that money.

677
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So there's one review called a review by the Business Integrity Review Group, which was a loan employee at Deutsche

678
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
sent to go through Bittar's emails.

679
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And Bittar's friend, or I think it was from Senegal.

680
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So he's a native French speaker.

681
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And the guy who was assigned to go through this doesn't even speak French, so they can't understand any of the communications.

682
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But Anshu asked your dad to take a look as well.

683
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And your dad did what's called a look-back.

684
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And he's supposed to go in there and figure out if everything was above board,

685
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and the profits were legitimate as opposed to being the result of fraud or manipulation or something like that.

686
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And so your dad spent a couple of weeks going through all the financial data and interviewing traders on Bittar's team.

687
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And his conclusion is a very narrowly crafted conclusion.

688
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It was that Bittar and his traders had a plausible strategy to make money off of interest rates moving in very specific directions,

689
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
by very specific amounts.

690
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And he stopped short of addressing the question of whether Bittar was manipulated live,

691
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
or he basically gave a blessing for this bonus to get paid for Bittar to be able to continue doing business.

692
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And this turns in as a huge mistake in retrospect.

693
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Bittar is engaged in what turns out to be a large, very lucrative criminal conspiracy.

694
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And that's going to result in the bank paying billions of dollars in penalties.

695
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And then people going to jail.

696
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And the Justice Department at that point, so this is now in 2013,

697
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
so four years later, has started this, a number of investigations, including into Deutsche,

698
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
which was in the process of drawing a criminal charge against people.

699
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And so there, your dad was under the impression he was a person of interest in this investigation.

700
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And, you know, there's no reason to think he was going to have really good in trouble,

701
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
but could his reputation be severely damaged?

702
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Could he have huge legal fees? That's not impossible.

703
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So that is my understanding of why your dad was so worried about live war.

704
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So why did he make this mistake?

705
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Is there anybody, if you've spoken to anyone that said maybe he didn't look at all the documents,

706
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
did he have some sort of...

707
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
One theory I have, and we'll get to this later, is that,

708
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and we know now what your dad wrote in his note to auction, right?

709
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh, right.

710
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
He talks about carelessness, and sloppiness, and betraying his trust.

711
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Betraying his trust, yeah.

712
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And it, I don't know. I mean, it's, I don't know what those words mean,

713
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
but this is one possibility.

714
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It seems like.

715
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay.

716
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Okay.

717
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So, a year later, so this is now early 2015, a guy named Victor Rocco.

718
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's just a Deutsche Bank's office at 60 Wall Street.

719
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And Rocco is someone who had been introduced to your mom a couple weeks after your dad's death.

720
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And he's a lawyer. He's a former federal prosecutor, turned private lawyer.

721
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And he is going there to have this meeting with Christian Seven and Simon Dodds,

722
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
who's another very senior lawyer at the bank, about this internal review that they had conducted

723
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
into the circumstances of your dad's death.

724
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And it, again, you know this already, but there's, there turns out there's a very, like,

725
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you know, kind of narrative explanation of what went on in that meeting.

726
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay.

727
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And it, and again, this is something you've shared with me, so you can know this already,

728
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,000
but Seven starts off by noting that he had been at the farewell lunch that Antje had hosted for Bill

729
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
back in November of 2013, and that Bill had seemed happy.

730
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No signs of him being a guy who's going to kill himself in two months.

731
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And then Seven and Dodds walk the lawyer, Rocco, through this review,

732
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and they acknowledge that the LIBOR investigation might have caused him some heartburn,

733
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and he might have had some legal exposure there.

734
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
We're talking about the memo.

735
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yes, this is the memo.

736
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And then the guy breathes through this laundry list of other issues that Bill had been dealing with,

737
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and there's DBTCA and the huge mess there.

738
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
They oddly assert that Bill, quote, was not responsible for DBTCA,

739
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
even though he was a member of the oversight board.

740
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
In which scam was this referring to?

741
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The basket trades?

742
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
DBTCA?

743
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah.

744
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Well, DBTCA, the biggest issue there was that the Federal Reserve was,

745
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I mean, DBTCA was kind of a dumping ground for all these problems,

746
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and so basket trades were there.

747
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The Russian mirror trades, which have another separate investigation, are there.

748
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The biggest concern, though, is that the financial data that DBTCA has produced into the Fed,

749
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
the New York Fed, is just like sloppy and wrong,

750
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and the Fed, they're kind of pulling the wool over the regulator's eyes on the stress tests.

751
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So there's a lot of problems there.

752
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The review also looks at what impact, if any, Boffin's rejection of Bill for those promotions,

753
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
what effect those had on him, and the conclusion is that it didn't affect him at all.

754
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It turns out, so the bank produces a report that is kind of summarizing conclusions,

755
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and the report is very sensitive.

756
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's only shared with a few members of the bank's board of directors.

757
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
A number of board members complained to the bank's chairman that they were not allowed to see the report into the death,

758
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and one of them told me that, quote, I was very suspicious.

759
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And when Rocco goes there, he doesn't get to see it either.

760
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He gets kind of a snippet of, he gets kind of a summary of what it found,

761
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and the summary is that, quote, nothing that shows a direct link between Bill's death and his work at Deutsche Bank.

762
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Of course you're going to say that.

763
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And aren't you commissioned this?

764
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah.

765
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You did?

766
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah.

767
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And so one of the kind of things they used to validate, just kind of questionable premise,

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
is that seven notes that in the months since the internal review wrapped up,

769
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Bill's name hadn't come up in public, connected to any of these investigations.

770
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And, of course, that's not true, because he had been named publicly in the Senate report into the basket options.

771
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And so Rocco notes, when he summarizes this meaning to your mom,

772
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that this suggests the Deutsche Investigation, quote, was not as exhaustive,

773
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
not as dynamic as both Dodd and Seven had described it.

774
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
He notes that it, quote, it seemed carefully scripted,

775
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and certainly both Simon and Christian were very careful in what they said to me.

776
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Down played his involvement in a bunch of things,

777
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and Simon, Seven and Dodd's, quote, could not explain the coroner's findings

778
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
or the medical records that established that Bill was fearful of civil liability

779
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and perhaps even prosecution because of his work at the bank.

780
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So now we've got, from my perspective, at least two data points that point to the bank really not being,

781
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
at best not being very transparent about what happened at worst, participating in a whitewash.

782
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, I know you're right.

783
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah.

784
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And then in the memo, they also randomly bring up

785
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that they did not take these files from my father's computer.

786
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, and I'm just not even addressing that in the book, honestly.

787
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Like, there's...

788
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Why?

789
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Well, I'm addressing that they did take them.

790
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But why not address the fact that they claim they did not?

791
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I mean, that's very odd.

792
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It is odd, right?

793
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It is odd.

794
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It is odd.

795
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I agree.

796
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I mean, is that not another data point for you?

797
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, maybe it is.

798
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Maybe it is.

799
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah.

800
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I mean, we have witnesses that this guy came.

801
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There's many...

802
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
No, I know.

803
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And Beth...

804
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It wasn't just me.

805
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
No, I know.

806
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Dude, if it was just you, I probably wouldn't be trusting your memory at that point.

807
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
No, because you were just like, it was very traumatic for you.

808
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes, it was traumatic.

809
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Beth confirms it.

810
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I remember Beth confirms it.

811
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Michael Morandi, he'll confirm it for you as well.

812
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
He was there.

813
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Beth confirms it.

814
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That's all I need.

815
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay.

816
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And there's...

817
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah.

818
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah.

819
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So...

820
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But why not put that in the book?

821
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah, I hear you.

822
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

823
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
No particular reason.

824
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Okay.

825
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah.

826
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We'll make a note there, David.

827
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Put it in the book.

828
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This is all being recorded, man.

829
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Clickety-clack into your fingers.

830
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Clickety-clack.

831
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Clickety-clack.

832
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Chop, chop.

833
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Come on.

834
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
All right.

835
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Okay, so you know what?

836
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm actually just going to pause this for a sec.

837
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah.

838
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And...

839
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Should I pause this, too?

840
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You don't matter.

841
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I just want to break up these files a little bit.

842
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Right.

843
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's too big.

844
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah.

845
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Okay.

846
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Um...

847
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Well, Marie just texted.

848
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
She's on her way.

849
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
She's going to clean the car.

850
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You doing okay?

851
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Uh, she's sick, so she bombed in the car.

852
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Who did?

853
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Marie.

854
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Marie bombed it in the car.

855
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

856
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
No, I mean, she pulled over to vomit.

857
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Wow.

858
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That's not good.

859
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Do you have this...

860
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Stomach logo on there?

861
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I don't know.

862
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Okay.

863
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay.

864
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay.

865
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Okay.

866
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Okay.

867
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Okay.

868
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Okay.

869
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay.

870
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Okay.

871
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay.

872
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay.

873
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay.

874
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Okay.

875
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Okay.

876
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay.

877
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Okay.

878
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't know.

879
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Bomber to the street.

880
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I feel better.

881
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I ate something and I didn't vomit.

882
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Um, she's going to go clean the car.

883
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
She'll be right back.

884
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,060
She'll be back looking 30 minutes.

885
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
Okay.

886
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't know, if she's okay.

887
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,500
I think she'll be okay.

888
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:56,000
It must have been food poisoning, or...

889
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You want me to go?

890
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

891
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Let's go already, alright.

892
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Okay.

893
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Um, that's interesting.

894
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Yeah, that's kind of fun.

895
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,440
It's interesting, I just think that-

896
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,680
Wait, can we wait and turn this on before you start?

897
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Yeah, right, yeah.

898
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,080
Yeah, David, I think it's,

899
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,480
it is a good data points,

900
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,640
but I really think it's important to add this bit here.

901
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,000
Because not only they're accusing me of lying,

902
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,800
but they're trying to cover something up

903
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,360
that is absurd to do so

904
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,120
when there are witnesses that can verify this guy's existence.

905
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,600
Okay, so now, yeah, no, I hear,

906
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,280
I mean, I'm not sure how important it is,

907
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,240
but I definitely see your point,

908
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,680
and there's no particular reason that's not in there.

909
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,960
Why are you saying you're not sure how important it is?

910
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,280
It's just that they are just-

911
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,840
It's like-

912
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,920
To me, what's the important part

913
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,000
is that they took the files, not that they're,

914
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,840
I don't know.

915
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,680
I hear what you're saying.

916
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,520
I don't feel strongly about this.

917
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
Let's not bicker about this,

918
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,520
because there's, I definitely see what you're saying.

919
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,360
I don't want to bicker.

920
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,680
There's no particular reason why not.

921
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,800
I just honestly want to understand

922
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,040
why you think it's not a big deal.

923
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,280
Because to me, it is a big deal.

924
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm not saying that it is,

925
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,800
I'm fighting with you to say what it is.

926
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,640
I just want to know in your head, why is it not-

927
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
That they're denying that they took it?

928
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,980
Yeah, yeah.

929
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,760
Because I don't know why they denied it.

930
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,600
Like, maybe Kristen Southern just didn't know, for example.

931
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,680
Like, I mean, I don't know.

932
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,520
There's, the important part from my perspective

933
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,360
is that they took it.

934
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,480
And there's plenty of evidence at this point.

935
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,240
But if you didn't know why we put it into the,

936
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,280
why even take the time to put it into this very heavily-

937
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,360
But that memo is not what they produced, right?

938
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,640
That's what the lawyer for your mom produced.

939
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,520
And so we don't know how much emphasis they gave it.

940
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,720
Again, I don't really disagree with you to be honest with you.

941
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,320
So there's, maybe it does belong in there.

942
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,600
So, okay.

943
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,440
So, we now switch over to Mododipasky for a moment.

944
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,280
Great.

945
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,200
And so, the way I've framed this here,

946
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,880
that you're about to discover another reason that your dad

947
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,520
isn't feeling bad about stuff from the non-affected bank.

948
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,520
So, and one of the things you find in your father's Yahoo account

949
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,680
is that Bill had repeatedly warned his colleagues

950
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,000
that these Mododipasky transactions were very risky.

951
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,720
And it's not like financial risk,

952
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
so much as reputational risk for the bank.

953
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,960
And he had, like one time after another, cautioned Faisola.

954
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,160
He'd asked that this be elevated to Anshu.

955
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,240
And just no one listened.

956
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,920
By the way, I've learned that,

957
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
I should have mentioned this earlier.

958
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,120
So, you're going to kick it out of this.

959
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:45,400
Anshu had a nephew who worked at Deutsche Bank.

960
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,720
And you know, the guy, some of Anshu's colleagues

961
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,920
felt quite a bit of pressure to find jobs for this guy inside the bank.

962
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,320
Guess what job he landed on, actually.

963
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:02,640
He was one of the guys exporting this Mododipasky style transaction

964
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,120
to other banks around the world.

965
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,640
Really?

966
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah.

967
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,440
So, they use Mododipasky transactions.

968
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,000
One of the reasons this is so lucrative, right?

969
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,160
They use it as a model for things they could do with other banks.

970
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,680
What?

971
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,840
How is that, what, just to overpay?

972
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,920
Well, no, they're basically the...

973
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,480
To buy up the debt and overpay for something?

974
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,240
No, no, no, no.

975
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,600
The MoneyDipasky transaction at its heart is,

976
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,000
and again, I think you probably know this already,

977
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,320
but there is, it's...

978
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,360
So, MoneyDipasky is facing really big losses on these derivatives

979
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,720
that Deutsche Bank had cooked up years earlier.

980
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,800
And so, they create these new class of derivatives

981
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,520
that in the very short term,

982
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,200
is going to send a bunch of money to Mododipasky,

983
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,440
which allows them to pretend to kind of conceal the losses

984
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,520
that they would otherwise be facing.

985
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,400
Is the Antivenet apart?

986
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,240
No, Antivenet...

987
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,600
That's Santorini.

988
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,480
That's Santorini.

989
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,520
Antivenet, just get that out of your head.

990
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,000
There's the...

991
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,200
So, it gives a short-term cash infusion to MoneyDipasky

992
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,400
so that they can pretend they didn't actually lose all this money

993
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,920
that they really did lost.

994
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,400
But then, over the next several years,

995
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,640
they have to pay back that money to Deutsche Bank

996
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,320
through these other transactions.

997
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,600
And as long as they're very profitable,

998
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,160
no one will overnet.

999
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,640
Obviously, that doesn't work out that way.

1000
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,080
Anyway, that means the debt just sort of floats

1001
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,320
without being landing on any books for a while.

1002
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,360
Yeah, kind of.

1003
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,800
So, it now becomes clear inside the bank

1004
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,240
that they're using similar transactions,

1005
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,120
model in the Mododipasky one, for other banks

1006
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,680
in places like Brazil and, I forget where else,

1007
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
but a couple other places.

1008
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,960
I'm using nephew.

1009
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,800
Yeah.

1010
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,040
And your dad warns that these, quote,

1011
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,520
may be a rounding error at this point,

1012
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,000
but they're growing quickly.

1013
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,240
Well, that's strange, also,

1014
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,000
because Anshu claims that he never signed off on this deal,

1015
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,840
or this...

1016
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,680
Yeah, that's...

1017
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,400
I don't know if Anshu signed off on it or not,

1018
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,720
that he certainly was aware of it.

1019
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,560
Right.

1020
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,200
And he had the concerns escalated to him.

1021
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,040
Yeah.

1022
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,200
I don't know if he's actually said he was not aware of it.

1023
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,320
I think that's what Dirk told me.

1024
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,080
But, you know, that's not, that's...

1025
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,920
Right.

1026
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,760
That's not...

1027
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,600
Okay.

1028
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,560
Okay.

1029
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,560
Sorry, Dirk.

1030
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,000
And so this, I note here, is,

1031
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,720
this is a very reminiscent of Warren's County.

1032
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,560
Yeah.

1033
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,160
Where your dad sees these derivative transactions

1034
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,880
piling up, they look really bad to him.

1035
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,720
Yeah.

1036
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,680
He, like, warns in writing repeatedly,

1037
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,600
and no one listens.

1038
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,120
And, sure enough, this, as you know,

1039
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,640
blows up in Deutsche Bank's face.

1040
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,600
And one of the pieces of evidence that's then used

1041
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,680
against the bank and against Faisola

1042
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,760
is the fact that your dad had warned in writing.

1043
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,600
His memories.

1044
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,440
Yeah.

1045
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,280
Exactly.

1046
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,480
It's very similar to Warren's County in that regard.

1047
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,320
And how does that, and Faisola and his wife

1048
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,480
are obviously close friends of your father and mother.

1049
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,080
And your dad's gotta be feeling

1050
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,960
like a little bit guilty about that, I imagine,

1051
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,120
because he, he...

1052
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,960
But he told Faisola, no.

1053
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,800
He wrote.

1054
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,640
He told Faisola, no.

1055
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,480
Yeah, right.

1056
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,400
But now the thing that he put in writing

1057
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,560
is being used to gin up criminal charges

1058
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,640
against his good friend.

1059
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,320
You know, the criminal charges came way later after his death.

1060
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,080
That's true, but the criminal investigation

1061
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,880
was well underway, and it was clear at that point

1062
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,720
that these emails that your dad had sent

1063
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,840
warning were going to be a problem.

1064
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,520
They were a crucial piece of evidence.

1065
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,240
That showed that not only was the bank doing something naughty,

1066
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,800
but the bank knew that what it was doing was naughty.

1067
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,760
I mean, that's...

1068
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,600
Okay.

1069
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,600
Look, that doesn't mean,

1070
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,120
that doesn't mean that could prove anything to us.

1071
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,280
No, I don't, my brain goes directly

1072
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,680
just Faisola's showing up today.

1073
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,520
My mother's saying, call McKaley, call McKaley.

1074
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,360
So...

1075
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,440
Yeah, I'm not sure there's anything to that other than

1076
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,920
that they were friends and lived nearby.

1077
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,680
Just putting out there, this is a tangent

1078
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,280
that my mind went to.

1079
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,560
Well, the tangent my mind goes to is that

1080
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,600
you around this time, having found all the stuff

1081
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,920
in both of your parents' emails, you emailed Faisola.

1082
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,840
And you asked him why he thought

1083
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,880
your dad had killed himself.

1084
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,240
And Faisola initially deflects the question

1085
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,680
and suggests that you not read too much

1086
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,400
into reports of Bill being under investigation.

1087
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,200
And he says, quote, unfortunately, we live in a world

1088
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,000
where banks are perceived as evil.

1089
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,880
And therefore, senior people are unfairly attacked

1090
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
by the media, politicians and regulators.

1091
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,600
And you keep pressing and Faisola eventually

1092
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,000
offers a more complete theory

1093
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,320
about what had been going on inside your dad's head.

1094
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,840
And it is, quote, I do not think that depression

1095
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,880
was caused by a specific work situation,

1096
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,080
but definitely work has contributed to it.

1097
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,920
And in the last few years, the whole industry

1098
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,280
has entered a very difficult and dark time.

1099
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,560
We all got attacked and vilified.

1100
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,640
I think he realized the end of his generation

1101
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,280
of managers was approaching.

1102
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,160
And maybe he could not deal with it.

1103
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,000
Definitely the fact that in the last two years,

1104
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,440
he did not have a clear job due to boffin opposition

1105
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,920
did not help.

1106
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,760
So...

1107
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,200
I just didn't like that he blamed boffin.

1108
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,480
He blamed that the thing that everyone else wants to blame

1109
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,040
is that he didn't get the, that they blocked him.

1110
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:10,880
I didn't like that.

1111
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,720
And I don't like the fact that he's vilified.

1112
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
I think this is a pretty...

1113
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,960
He's saying he's being vilified

1114
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,840
and he's saying my dad's being vilified.

1115
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,680
And that...

1116
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,920
Well, he's saying a lot more than that.

1117
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,520
He's saying bankers are being vilified.

1118
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,480
That's the first thing he says.

1119
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,960
That's not the second thing he's saying.

1120
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,080
He says that there's...

1121
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,680
He's really saying that, first of all, your dad was depressed.

1122
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,320
Second of all, there wasn't a specific thing.

1123
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,440
There was just all of this.

1124
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,680
There were all these investigations.

1125
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,360
He's saying, I think he realized

1126
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,880
the end of the generation of managers

1127
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,520
was approaching and maybe he could not deal with it.

1128
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,840
That's fine, Donna, I accept.

1129
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,160
Which reminds me a lot of what we talked about yesterday.

1130
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,560
Yeah, with the Dixon fuckers.

1131
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,480
The Troy Dixon gang of sheds.

1132
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,760
So this is all beginning to make a little bit more sense

1133
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,600
to me at this point.

1134
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,880
And honestly, I think it was making a little more sense

1135
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,920
to you at the time too, if I recall.

1136
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,520
This theory is, yes.

1137
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,800
Okay.

1138
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,640
So.

1139
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,000
This one theory, because there are others.

1140
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,480
But yes, it makes a little sense.

1141
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,720
Wait, sorry.

1142
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,760
What's one theory?

1143
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,960
That this isn't him feeling like it's out of control

1144
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
because he's a generational thing

1145
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,080
and now he doesn't...

1146
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,600
People aren't listening to him anymore.

1147
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,680
He's not the...

1148
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,640
The statue he had before is the voice of reason

1149
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,600
where everyone was worshiping him as he asked,

1150
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,440
Bill, what do we do here?

1151
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,280
What do we do here?

1152
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,200
He's being disrespected.

1153
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,760
He's being circumvented.

1154
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,840
You know, how have I missed this?

1155
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,360
I don't know.

1156
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,360
But I've missed here is your dad's notes.

1157
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,160
How did we...

1158
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,720
Because that's when you were at the university club.

1159
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,880
Yeah.

1160
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,040
Did we go over that yesterday?

1161
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,880
Yeah.

1162
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,720
Oh, we did, okay.

1163
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,320
Yeah, you were, I'm sorry.

1164
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,000
So just to reread Anshu's, his note to Anshu now,

1165
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,240
because I think that's helpful for Remake,

1166
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,720
continuing to keep in mind the framing of all this

1167
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,400
in his mind at the time.

1168
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,880
She says, Anshu, you were so good to me

1169
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,240
and I've repaid you with carelessness.

1170
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,480
I've betrayed your trust

1171
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,760
and hid my horrible nature from you.

1172
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,080
I can't even begin to fathom the damage I have done.

1173
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,400
I am eternally sorry and condemned.

1174
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,120
And then we combine that, take that,

1175
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,560
which raises obviously a ton of questions.

1176
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,560
Take that with this nugget from the note he left

1177
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,320
to your mom and it says, even my career,

1178
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,400
which was once a source of pride, ended anonymously.

1179
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,000
I look back at it with shame,

1180
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,080
another gift that I was careless with and poisoned.

1181
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,120
My role as a director of DBTCA is burdensome

1182
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,320
and something I'm not suited for.

1183
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,200
However, I have to pretend to enjoy it

1184
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,080
because it is my only remaining source of status.

1185
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,360
I can't look back, I can't look forward.

1186
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,240
So that's some heavy shit.

1187
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,200
But just fucking be careful with that

1188
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,040
because you're taking the ramblings of a guy

1189
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,960
that's kind of lost and gone over the edge

1190
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,160
just before he kills himself.

1191
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,040
And the self-deprecation and the self-annihilation.

1192
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,880
That's not self-deprecation.

1193
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah, the self-hatred is there.

1194
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,120
It's self-hatred, yeah.

1195
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,600
Yes, the self-hatred is there and it's present

1196
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,280
and it's clouding all his judgments, okay?

1197
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,560
And so it's seeping out into his words, his verbiage,

1198
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,520
everything.

1199
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,240
So be careful not to put too much stake in that

1200
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,600
because sometimes we all get down on ourselves

1201
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,440
and we hate ourselves and we only see bad shit.

1202
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,000
And that colors everything else.

1203
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,840
No.

1204
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,960
But if you focus on something, if it's not you

1205
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,600
and you're looking at someone else's...

1206
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,440
But to the extent that...

1207
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,840
No, if you're looking at someone else's vomit

1208
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,040
of self-hatred and you look through it

1209
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,160
and you find these little pieces

1210
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,240
that were eaten a long time ago, they're coming out,

1211
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,720
you can't focus on that as making a data point.

1212
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,680
That's, first of all, a disgusting analogy.

1213
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,680
And second of all, I completely,

1214
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,320
I think that's very smart what you're saying.

1215
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,280
But to the extent that our goal here

1216
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,680
is to better understand why your dad killed himself,

1217
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,920
looking at his self-hatred and how he expresses

1218
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,160
his self-hatred, I think is highly relevant

1219
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,480
when it's in the context of all these other data points.

1220
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,560
So...

1221
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,000
Right, but that's what I'm afraid of

1222
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
is that we're building a false context of data points,

1223
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,640
a false house, easily broken, a glass house,

1224
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,440
one little window could smash it.

1225
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,640
I'm just not thinking Billy Joel's album, Glass House.

1226
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,520
Anyway, this...

1227
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,360
Sorry, you lost me there.

1228
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,200
No, I just...

1229
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,040
My mind went on a thing.

1230
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:32,880
Okay, so...

1231
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,120
But no, no, no, but do you get what I'm saying?

1232
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,120
Just be careful because if you use that,

1233
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,080
if you use this self-hatred spewage

1234
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,600
for your data point to support your other theory,

1235
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,040
I think that it's very wobbly.

1236
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,760
I mean, you have, if you're going home

1237
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,800
and you have a terrible day at work

1238
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,520
and the wife is driving you nuts

1239
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,240
and the kids are going crazy

1240
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,080
and then your mom calls and your dad calls

1241
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,680
and you lost something, you're just like,

1242
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,520
oh, and then all of a sudden you take it inward

1243
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,760
and you maybe saw my fault, I'm an asshole, I'm an idiot.

1244
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,360
And you start writing all this stuff down

1245
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,040
about just to get it out of you.

1246
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,880
I'm an asshole, I'm an idiot,

1247
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,000
I can't believe I did this, it's all my fault.

1248
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,400
And then you go to sleep and then a few days later

1249
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,960
you wake up and you feel a lot better,

1250
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,600
you look back at the thing, you're like, oh my God.

1251
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,320
I can't believe I blame myself for all this.

1252
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,520
You know, how ridiculous, this obviously is not my fault.

1253
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,640
This obviously, my mom's the one that said this,

1254
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,080
so that's why I reacted like this.

1255
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,720
And you look back and you use your rational brain,

1256
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,080
you look through it and you realize

1257
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,440
this was you expaling an expulsion

1258
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,080
or expounding all these things

1259
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,680
that you were inside you at the time.

1260
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,240
But you don't go through them and use them

1261
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,440
as a data point to build a theory as to anything else.

1262
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,400
It's almost irrelevant in that sense.

1263
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,360
I disagree.

1264
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,400
Almost irrelevant.

1265
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,640
The most relevant is the self-hatred

1266
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,400
in the bigger picture, but the details of the self-hatred,

1267
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,680
I don't think are that relevant.

1268
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,320
Except that we know, first of all, they killed himself.

1269
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,640
And we know what he said to his psychologist,

1270
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,440
and to his doctor, and numerous of his friends,

1271
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,840
and his lawyer, and it all says the same thing, Val.

1272
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,760
Okay.

1273
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,520
You know what I mean, I agree with you

1274
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,360
that we shouldn't take these in isolation.

1275
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,400
We shouldn't. Yeah, yeah.

1276
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,400
But we're not.

1277
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,400
I mean, this is a lot of evidence.

1278
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,000
Okay.

1279
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,840
I hear you.

1280
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,240
But it isn't.

1281
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,360
Like when he says he betrayed Anshun.

1282
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,960
I don't think he didn't literally betray him.

1283
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,720
I think he thinks he failed him.

1284
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,520
Yeah, but why didn't he just say fail?

1285
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,200
Because he was, you know, obviously a very dark place.

1286
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,400
And he didn't betray Anshun.

1287
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,680
Like the...

1288
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,120
But to someone that doesn't know my father,

1289
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,520
there's no situation to read this and says betrayed.

1290
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,640
Oh, clearly, Bill is hiding something.

1291
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,280
Clearly, David's not writing something.

1292
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,000
Clearly, Val is holding back something he found in the emails

1293
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,520
because there's word betrayal in there.

1294
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,200
By the time I paid 281,

1295
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,680
Did you get my point?

1296
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,000
Yes, I understand.

1297
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,120
How strong that word can be missed.

1298
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,320
Well, but it's not my word.

1299
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,320
I know, but how, to a novice reader of this story,

1300
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,280
in this book, to just see that word and have that pop out,

1301
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,720
such a loaded word,

1302
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,680
that they can easily conspiracy theories arise.

1303
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,840
Val and David are leaving out something very important

1304
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,680
that Bill's guilty of.

1305
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,760
Why would he kill himself?

1306
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,320
Clearly, he did something wrong.

1307
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,960
Do you know, it's like the fallacy of saying,

1308
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,880
well, why is Val's mom treating him like this?

1309
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,520
Clearly, Val did something wrong.

1310
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,360
You know?

1311
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,640
The fallacy of, you know, do you get my point?

1312
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,640
Yeah, except that this is page 281 of a book

1313
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,680
that has your dad's rise and fall

1314
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,640
as one of its central narrative backbones.

1315
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,160
And I do not think anyone can be taking anything out of context

1316
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,000
to this one in the book.

1317
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I just wanted to let you see what your thoughts are on that.

1318
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,920
And express my thoughts.

1319
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,400
You know, it's a risk in my head, it's a risk.

1320
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,560
Well, but I'm trying to manage.

1321
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,400
Yeah, I hear you.

1322
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,120
But I mean, to me, like,

1323
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,440
I'm not bothered by that risk.

1324
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,440
I think the risk is there's no way to ignore what he wrote.

1325
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,440
And you put it in a lot of context

1326
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,560
and it belongs a lot.

1327
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,240
But you could add an opposing viewpoint.

1328
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,080
What's the opposing viewpoint?

1329
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,920
What I just told you.

1330
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,160
No one's suggesting he betrayed him.

1331
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,880
There's, I think in his head,

1332
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,320
he probably felt like he had failed, though.

1333
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,440
That makes more sense.

1334
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,960
But he didn't use the word fail.

1335
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,280
Well, he used the word carelessness.

1336
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,120
Yeah.

1337
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,960
And it.

1338
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,600
That leads to failure, I guess.

1339
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,440
Okay.

1340
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,240
So let's see.

1341
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,800
Am I going to Europe?

1342
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,920
Is that what's next?

1343
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,760
So what's next?

1344
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,120
Let's go to Europe.

1345
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,000
Off you go.

1346
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,840
Okay.

1347
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,600
So you decided to go to Europe

1348
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,440
a little bit after the second anniversary of your death.

1349
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,600
Are you going over the post thing?

1350
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,360
No.

1351
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,400
I'm mentioning, that's a good question, actually.

1352
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,680
Let me, we'll get there in two minutes.

1353
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,520
Okay.

1354
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,960
So you decided to go to Europe

1355
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,520
a little bit after the second anniversary of your death.

1356
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,320
So that's in early 2016.

1357
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,320
It's March, probably.

1358
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,160
Yeah.

1359
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,240
I'm noting that, and maybe this is wrong, actually,

1360
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
and I should fix this.

1361
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,320
But there is, at least the way it seemed to me

1362
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,440
and previous, our infinite conversations

1363
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,760
we've had about this.

1364
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,080
By this point, it seemed a bit clearer to you

1365
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,520
that your dad clearly had committed suicide,

1366
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:45,520
at least in part, because of fear and concern

1367
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,840
and shame about what had happened at the back.

1368
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,440
No, not yet.

1369
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,280
Not yet.

1370
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,440
This is a good thing you brought up.

1371
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,360
Because at this point, that's why I said,

1372
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,280
I'm going to go over the post part,

1373
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,600
because this is when Michael Gray comes in

1374
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,400
and plants it in my head that my dad was murdered.

1375
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,000
He puts this into my head,

1376
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,920
which I already kind of thought,

1377
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,200
he was toying with this idea that he was forced

1378
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,120
to kill himself or suicide by extortion.

1379
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,760
Like, if you don't kill yourself, we're gonna,

1380
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,240
the Hollywood version.

1381
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,520
In fact, the next paragraph here,

1382
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,800
we got into Michael Gray, so.

1383
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,200
Yeah, and when that seed was planted in my head,

1384
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,600
I went to, I wanted to meet David Rossi,

1385
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,840
when I learned the whole David Rossi story.

1386
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,240
But did you think at that point,

1387
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,680
that in a literally like way?

1388
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,360
I didn't want to believe that my dad killed himself.

1389
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,360
I did not want to believe that at all.

1390
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,560
And that's, tell me why.

1391
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:44,360
I just, it just didn't fit in my understanding of my father.

1392
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,720
It just didn't fit in anyone's understanding of him.

1393
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,560
As you can guess.

1394
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,740
Yeah, that's definitely true.

1395
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,320
So there's, in congruency there,

1396
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,280
I wanted to figure out what was wrong.

1397
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,280
And what was, maybe I have to examine all possibilities.

1398
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,560
And one of those possibilities is that it was

1399
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,000
some sort of shady mafia shit with Monty Duposky.

1400
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,080
And that's what Michael Gray planted in my head.

1401
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,080
And I ran with it.

1402
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,600
And I really took it to the end of its,

1403
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,160
I took it as far as I could go until I realized

1404
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,320
that that was ridiculous.

1405
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,760
But I had to examine it.

1406
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,600
No, I understand.

1407
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,000
And this is actually, in fact,

1408
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,680
basically the way I've written it.

1409
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,520
There's no indication of foul playing Bill's death,

1410
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,560
but after watching the Italian video,

1411
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,520
you couldn't help but wonder

1412
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,680
whether I'm going to uncover, et cetera, et cetera.

1413
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,160
So one thing I need to run by here or tell you

1414
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,360
is that I've got a footnote here.

1415
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,640
There aren't many footnotes in this book,

1416
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,360
but there's one right here.

1417
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,240
Which I say, exercising awful judgment,

1418
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,160
you shared with Michael Gray,

1419
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,000
one of the photos you've shown,

1420
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,320
or you've taken of your dad lying in the hallway.

1421
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,200
And I say that exhibiting even worse taste,

1422
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,400
the post then published that photo.

1423
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,720
And I'm saying that your family-

1424
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,400
I was saying the emails where I was upset about that.

1425
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,240
And I'm saying-

1426
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,600
The emails I said to Michael Gray,

1427
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,480
like, why did you do this to take it out?

1428
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,560
And they said it was too late

1429
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,400
because it's already-

1430
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,640
Well, they did edit it, ultimately.

1431
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,480
But there-

1432
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,320
They did.

1433
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,160
Ultimately, yeah, it's not like that.

1434
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,320
I haven't even looked.

1435
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,160
Yeah, it's gone.

1436
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,000
I mean-

1437
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,840
That's great.

1438
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,000
But in his, I mean, there is not much defense room.

1439
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,560
Like, you should not have published those photos,

1440
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,400
I don't think.

1441
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,440
But on the other hand, yeah, you like did,

1442
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,080
he's a journalist and you gave it to him, so.

1443
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,680
You should have asked me.

1444
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,440
Well, whatever, it doesn't matter.

1445
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,280
There is-

1446
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,120
No, it doesn't matter.

1447
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,520
I said, can I use this photo in the production?

1448
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,440
I said, yes or no, you know, you should have asked me.

1449
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,480
I'm noting that your family suspected

1450
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,400
you had sold the photo to the post,

1451
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,960
which was not the case,

1452
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,360
and they never forgave you for that.

1453
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,960
No, for something, never forgave you

1454
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,680
for something that never happened.

1455
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,240
Well, you did share it with the post.

1456
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,080
Yes, I did share it.

1457
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,200
Which was not in my, I don't think,

1458
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,600
you've not, this is a stupid move.

1459
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,440
It was stupid, yeah.

1460
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,280
Yeah, shit, yeah.

1461
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,200
Just wanted to know what it would be,

1462
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,040
what we want to be at the scene,

1463
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,880
what it would look like.

1464
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,920
And then I thought, you know,

1465
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,720
they could have gotten it from the police anyway,

1466
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,240
it's like handed everything over to them,

1467
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,880
so why not save them some fucking time?

1468
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,840
It's not like they couldn't get it in my head,

1469
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,600
so I thought, I don't know.

1470
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,440
Okay.

1471
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,960
It was, yes, but yes, it was a terrible move,

1472
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,000
and it's fine to put that in there.

1473
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,840
Okay.

1474
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,160
Okay, so you, maybe you've already done this,

1475
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,320
but you go into your mom's email,

1476
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,960
you find the details for AMX.

1477
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,800
And...

1478
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,440
I think also, if I could just go back for a minute,

1479
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,800
instead of just a footnote saying

1480
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,000
it was a ridiculously terrible move,

1481
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,960
can you explain that it became a huge

1482
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,320
incident between the family?

1483
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,160
Yeah, no, I say that.

1484
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,880
I say, Val family suspected that he had sold

1485
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,240
the photo to the post, which was not the case,

1486
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,680
and they never forgave him.

1487
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,640
Okay, I mean, you think it's only worth a footnote?

1488
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,720
Yeah, I do.

1489
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,000
Um...

1490
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,760
Okay, so you get your mom's AMX number,

1491
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,840
you buy a bunch of new computer equipment

1492
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,880
for the trip to Europe,

1493
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,360
you load all this stuff onto one of the new laptops,

1494
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,840
you get a business class ticket to Paris,

1495
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,440
and you fly in March of 2016.

1496
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,360
You land at Charles de Gaulle,

1497
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,920
and things immediately go off course.

1498
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,360
You're in the bathroom,

1499
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,480
briefly to snort a few lines of coke,

1500
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,600
and you leave your bags unattended.

1501
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,440
Yeah.

1502
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,880
And when you come out,

1503
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,280
a bunch of the new computer stuff is gone.

1504
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,000
The laptop with all the stuff on it.

1505
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,440
I'd go, and it was snorting heroin, not coke, but...

1506
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,280
That's good.

1507
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,120
Let me...

1508
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:31,960
That somehow fits right now.

1509
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,160
Yeah, and I was doing that on the flight, too.

1510
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,520
And I had gone to the bathroom,

1511
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,480
yes, but I did not leave my bags unattended.

1512
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,520
I had them all in that silly little push cart

1513
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,560
they have brought into the bathroom with me.

1514
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,120
I specifically chose one of those big disabled bathrooms,

1515
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,640
so I could put it all in there.

1516
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,080
Took it all back out, everything was in my line of sight,

1517
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,760
and I go to buy a SIM card,

1518
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,280
and it's the only time I could not take it

1519
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,520
into the kiosk area.

1520
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,480
I had to leave it next to the cashier.

1521
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,320
Got it, okay.

1522
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,680
That's when I would have lost my line of sight

1523
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,880
for just a few minutes.

1524
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,960
Yeah, okay.

1525
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,720
So computer equipment gets stolen,

1526
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,560
except for the laptop with all the stuff

1527
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,800
you'd got taken from your dad's files.

1528
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,960
There were two iParents,

1529
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,760
and two possibly,

1530
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,120
whatever it was in the police car, I can't remember,

1531
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,160
it was two hard drives, the big G drives,

1532
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,360
like those two terabytes worth.

1533
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,160
Two of those are gone, and the iPads are missing.

1534
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,000
Yeah, okay.

1535
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,800
And the backpacks I had on my,

1536
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,520
I was wearing them so they couldn't have taken those.

1537
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,360
Okay.

1538
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,680
Nothing else was taken, no passport,

1539
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,000
everything else was, nothing else was stolen,

1540
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,600
but those specific drives.

1541
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,440
Okay, you called Larry Meltzer from the airport,

1542
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,280
told him what had happened.

1543
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,960
I called him at the hotel, but not at the airport.

1544
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,960
You sure about that?

1545
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,200
I'm pretty sure you called him from the airport.

1546
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,400
Did I call him from the airport?

1547
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,240
I may have.

1548
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,280
If he says I did, I probably didn't.

1549
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,880
Okay, so he told you.

1550
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,240
I called him many times, I just can't remember.

1551
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,240
Yeah, he told you that it was possible

1552
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,880
that you were being followed,

1553
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,040
perhaps at least I'm from Deutsche,

1554
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,280
and he just warned you to be careful.

1555
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,120
Yeah.

1556
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,760
So you then rent an Audi from Avis?

1557
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,320
No, Nissan Cascua, Cascai.

1558
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,240
Really?

1559
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,080
Yeah, yeah.

1560
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:25,920
What did he?

1561
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,760
It's a bit later.

1562
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,440
I spent about three weeks detoxing off the heroin.

1563
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,120
Unfortunately, in France, there's a lot of coding

1564
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,000
over the counter, so that was very helpful.

1565
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,440
But when you drive to Amsterdam,

1566
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,440
you drive an Audi from Avis?

1567
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,720
No, no, no, no.

1568
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,880
When I drive to Amsterdam, I drive a Nissan Cascai.

1569
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,720
You sure?

1570
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,360
That's what, in Amsterdam, your car gets smashed.

1571
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,760
Yeah, that's the Cascai, the Cascai.

1572
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,280
Are you 100% certain about that?

1573
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,800
Because you showed me a photo of this.

1574
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,800
Yeah, I'm 100% certain.

1575
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,920
I'm saying this, but it looks like an Audi, but it's not.

1576
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,200
Okay, so what is it?

1577
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,400
It's a Nissan QUA.

1578
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,240
I don't care.

1579
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,080
I'll just say Nissan.

1580
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:01,920
QUAI.

1581
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,120
Okay, Nissan.

1582
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,320
I'll share the photos.

1583
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,960
Okay, so one evening, someone smashes the car's window,

1584
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,480
steals the remaining laptop,

1585
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,640
which was hidden under the passenger seat,

1586
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,760
and yet your wallet, password, guitar,

1587
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,760
which were all in plain view weren't stolen.

1588
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,600
This is in Amsterdam.

1589
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,440
Yes.

1590
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,280
Yeah.

1591
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,600
And that's it for you.

1592
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,000
You concluded at this point, and as does Larry Meltzer,

1593
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,480
that there's a conspiracy afoot.

1594
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,480
A conspiracy afoot.

1595
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,840
And, you know, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to

1596
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,800
And Meltzer is further convinced of this

1597
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,960
because he, at one time when you're talking,

1598
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,200
hears some odd clicking sounds on the line,

1599
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,440
and another time you call him,

1600
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,560
but end up getting connected to his wife's cell phone.

1601
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,400
Very weird.

1602
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,240
Yeah.

1603
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,640
And then not only that, I mean,

1604
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,120
computers would turn off restart on their own.

1605
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,040
The phones would turn off restart on their own.

1606
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,200
Very strange things happen.

1607
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,120
Very odd buggy behavior.

1608
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,320
We're both convinced.

1609
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,680
Well, he convinced me that I was being hacked.

1610
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,760
I didn't want to believe it, because I had,

1611
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,280
remember, I had just been through this terrible experience

1612
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,120
of paranoia and delusion.

1613
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,040
I did not want to ever go back there again.

1614
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,400
So any hint of you're being followed was like,

1615
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,800
I don't want to believe this.

1616
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,040
I'm not being followed.

1617
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,400
I'm perfectly normal.

1618
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,880
Everything's normal, you know?

1619
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,600
And Larry had to keep beating it into me

1620
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,640
that be careful, be careful, be careful.

1621
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,480
Yeah.

1622
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,120
I mean, some people might argue that that is not

1623
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,640
the most constructive rule for a therapist,

1624
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,720
I know, I know, I know.

1625
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,280
It's funny that the therapist is telling me

1626
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,520
to be more paranoid.

1627
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,880
Yes, funny is the word for it.

1628
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,440
It's ironic, ironic.

1629
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,880
Okay, so you check into a suite in the Steigenberger,

1630
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,800
Airbird of Tallinn, Amsterdam.

1631
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:54,080
Wait, but what about the whole time in the Camping

1632
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:54,920
of Ligambos?

1633
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,760
That was a whole...

1634
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,440
No, that's afterwards.

1635
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,360
No, no, no, no, no.

1636
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,480
I check into, I can see it in my head.

1637
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,760
This is the campground you're talking about?

1638
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,200
Yes, before the campground, I check into

1639
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,280
the Hotel New Hampshire, New Hampshire Hotels

1640
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,880
right in Rembrandt Square.

1641
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,880
Tell them the name of it if I can find it for you.

1642
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,880
And I stay there for about 12-ish days

1643
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,000
before I'm going to go to Siena.

1644
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,800
And we also passed up to me trying to get back

1645
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,320
into the country, back into England.

1646
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
Yeah, I don't care about that.

1647
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,160
Okay.

1648
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,240
Now, are you sure about this

1649
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,480
because I've looked at the receipts

1650
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,880
from the airport hotel.

1651
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,040
Yeah, no, I definitely stayed there,

1652
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:41,040
but that was after the Camping of Ligambos.

1653
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,640
It was a Hampshire hotel in Rembrandt Square.

1654
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,840
I'm going to call it Hotel New Hampshire,

1655
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,960
but it's not, that's a book by John Irving.

1656
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,720
It was something, something, and it had a nice suite.

1657
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,320
Don't worry about, what are you doing right now, by the way?

1658
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,560
I'm trying to find the photo of the car,

1659
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,200
of the Nissan Cache Quarry.

1660
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,920
And I'll show you the picture of the hotel as well,

1661
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,000
the actual name of the hotel in Amsterdam.

1662
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,560
Okay, so you stay at another hotel in Amsterdam.

1663
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,400
Yes.

1664
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,640
Then, using your mom's AmEx,

1665
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,640
and then you, she or her guy figures out

1666
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,360
that there's theft going on.

1667
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,520
Not yet.

1668
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,000
Why do you end up at the campground then?

1669
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,440
So I'm at the campground.

1670
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,280
No, no, no, no.

1671
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,160
You're in a hotel.

1672
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,000
Yeah.

1673
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,520
Why do you go from a hotel to a campground?

1674
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,320
So I met this lady in a bar in Amsterdam,

1675
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,680
and she said, you got to come to this place

1676
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,800
called Fliegenboos, where there's like a hippie dream.

1677
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,480
You know, everyone's jamming all the time,

1678
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,480
and people from all over the world are here,

1679
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,400
and it's just like the coolest place in Amsterdam.

1680
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,320
And come on Saturday night, especially,

1681
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,760
you know, I want you to come play with us.

1682
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,840
You brought your guitars, you know,

1683
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,520
come jam and play a show here.

1684
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,160
And I'm like, okay, fine, why not?

1685
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,760
You know, I haven't played music in a while.

1686
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,840
It'll be good to meet some, some cool people in Amsterdam,

1687
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,440
and go.

1688
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,120
So I drive down there,

1689
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,880
and it turns out it was not the hippie dream she mentioned.

1690
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,520
She just was running this music show,

1691
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,040
this music night at the place,

1692
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,800
and just wanted me to play for free.

1693
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,640
So I was like, okay, fine.

1694
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,240
So when I played, I rented a cabin,

1695
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,600
and I stayed there for two nights,

1696
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,200
and the night before I was going to leave,

1697
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,400
I think it was a Sunday,

1698
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,360
I go into Amsterdam, into Thalstra,

1699
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,400
to go buy some cigarettes in the center of Amsterdam.

1700
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,760
I leave the car in a cobblestone fucking street

1701
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,760
to go buy cigarettes.

1702
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,320
I've gone for five fucking minutes.

1703
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,880
I get back into the car,

1704
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,480
I get back toward the car, I see the strewn glass,

1705
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,640
and I'm like, oh shit,

1706
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,000
somebody's car just got broken into,

1707
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,800
I feel terrible over it.

1708
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,120
This happened too.

1709
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,560
I get closer to my car, and underneath the fucking lamp,

1710
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,360
you know, there's just windows gone smashed.

1711
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,360
I'm like, fuck it's me, you know?

1712
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,640
I go in, I check to see what's missing.

1713
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,040
Only thing that's missing is the black laptop.

1714
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,720
Just exactly like this, I use this exact same cover.

1715
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,360
In the darkness of night,

1716
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,960
under cover of the fucking night,

1717
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,200
in Amsterdam, under one streetlight,

1718
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,760
underneath the passenger side seat,

1719
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,720
you had to know where it was.

1720
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:14,640
My passport, right here, right here,

1721
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,760
nothing else was taken.

1722
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,360
Guitars, in the back, my strat, in the back,

1723
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,640
all my luggage, in the back.

1724
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,480
I'm just starting to lose it.

1725
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,120
Can we just focus on the chronology for a second though?

1726
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,840
There's, okay, so you're at this New Hampshire hotel,

1727
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,960
whatever it's called.

1728
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,680
You then go and spend a couple nights at the campground,

1729
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,200
then your car that's broken into,

1730
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,760
and they steal the laptop, and then what?

1731
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,520
And then, I file a police report,

1732
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,520
I go to the Amsterdam police,

1733
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,120
we call Avis, tell them what happened.

1734
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,520
They said they're gonna send a tow truck the next day

1735
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,200
and swap out cars for me, you know,

1736
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,720
don't worry about it, et cetera, et cetera.

1737
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,560
You might have to pay a little bit for the window,

1738
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,240
whatever you're based on your insurance.

1739
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,480
I'm like, great, I got full insurance, you know?

1740
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,920
At least I thought I did, I turned out I didn't.

1741
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,120
I go back to the campground, I sleep, I wake up,

1742
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,320
I go to check out with my card,

1743
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,360
and the, I can't remember his name anymore,

1744
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,640
but the guy's like, your card's not working,

1745
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,480
I was like, what do you mean it's not working,

1746
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,840
it's not working, so your card's not working.

1747
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,720
So I call the bank, and I look at the app,

1748
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,360
sorry, I didn't call the bank, I look at the app,

1749
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,040
and I'm negative $15,000.

1750
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:17,880
It's like, what the fuck?

1751
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:22,200
And it's from Avis, I fetch Avis, and so then I'm stuck.

1752
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,920
And so then you just stay at the campground

1753
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,120
for a while, and I just stay at the campground.

1754
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,560
Okay.

1755
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,920
There were, yes, the reason I couldn't get out,

1756
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,080
because I could not.

1757
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,280
Wait, so then were you using your mom's credit card,

1758
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,360
or was that another credit card?

1759
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,000
I was using, no, for the,

1760
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Vleganbos was not very expensive,

1761
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,640
so I could use my card for that.

1762
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,120
But what about for Avis?

1763
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,680
For Avis, I used my mom's card,

1764
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,120
but I paid with my, I used my mom's card as the,

1765
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,240
because you can't do it with a debit card in that country,

1766
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,520
but I can use the credit card number

1767
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,680
and put it on my card,

1768
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,720
because it could not charge remotely only on digits.

1769
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,000
I had to show up with an actual thing,

1770
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,560
but on the reservation online, you can use just digits,

1771
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,440
but you have to show up with a proper car

1772
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,280
that they can take money from in person.

1773
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,320
So they couldn't take money off my mom's card,

1774
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,720
they can only take it off my card.

1775
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,880
So I used it to establish that there is credit,

1776
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,920
and that if anything happens,

1777
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,160
you can go to this credit card company.

1778
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:19,560
That's the way they did it in fucking Avis Charles DeGaulle.

1779
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,440
Do you understand what I mean?

1780
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,320
Yes.

1781
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,800
What I'm confused about a little bit is-

1782
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,120
And I had to use my money,

1783
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,400
otherwise I would have got a much better card.

1784
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,360
At the Hampshire Hotel,

1785
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:33,360
you are staying on for 12 nights on your mom's card.

1786
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,760
Yes.

1787
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,600
Okay.

1788
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,000
So why once your bank account gets drained by Avis,

1789
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,400
why don't you just go somewhere else

1790
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,600
and put it on your mom's card?

1791
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,440
Because that, yeah, that card, I couldn't use it.

1792
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,520
I couldn't use that anymore.

1793
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,640
Because your mom had figured it out.

1794
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,040
She had canceled that card, yeah.

1795
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,080
That specific card, and I hadn't gone back

1796
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,400
to the emails to find other cards.

1797
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,600
Right, and she had figured out, okay.

1798
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,440
And I did try.

1799
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,640
So what I've gotten wrong here is not,

1800
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,240
it's really just that I got wrong in the name of the hotel.

1801
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,080
Right.

1802
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,880
So, okay.

1803
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,360
And the Audi.

1804
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,200
Yeah, and the Audi.

1805
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,040
Yeah, and the Audi.

1806
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,280
Believe me, if I could have used my mom's card,

1807
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,560
I would have gotten a much nicer car.

1808
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,600
Okay, I'm quoting you saying

1809
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,800
that you didn't feel guilty stealing from her.

1810
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,720
Not at all.

1811
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,000
And I'm quoting you saying,

1812
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,440
this is the only way I can get at her.

1813
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,760
This is the only jab I can take at her.

1814
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,160
Yeah, but that's just, you know, that's silly.

1815
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,600
I mean, again, like I told you outside,

1816
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,680
I have no home.

1817
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,040
I'm living in rental cars in hotels.

1818
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,400
And so I really have no sympathy for her

1819
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,680
to take her money, to stay alive and eat.

1820
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,240
Good.

1821
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,280
No sympathy, to have shelter and eat.

1822
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,200
And yes, you know, I didn't get the basics.

1823
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,840
I didn't go to a shitty fucking roadway in.

1824
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,160
I went to the best hotels I could.

1825
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,000
So fuck her out.

1826
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,520
Just, it'd be nice to have some little bit of luxury

1827
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,680
for that I missed for a very long time.

1828
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,040
You know, why not?

1829
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,200
And it wasn't a fuck you.

1830
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,520
It wasn't like, oh, I'm gonna,

1831
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,520
this is my fuck you to her.

1832
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,440
This is me staying alive and surviving

1833
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,280
and get through this trip.

1834
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,720
So I can get to fucking Sienna

1835
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,720
and find out what's going on with David Rossi.

1836
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,560
Okay.

1837
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,680
And get to UBS and find and meet Sergio Armani.

1838
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,760
That was the other part of the thing.

1839
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,640
But that happened later.

1840
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,120
Yes, indeed.

1841
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,920
Okay, so at the campground, you mean?

1842
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,000
I would take out, this is my only way of getting back.

1843
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,400
Maybe yes, that's part of it.

1844
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,240
There was some anger there,

1845
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,360
but that wasn't the basic need.

1846
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,040
The basic need was to eat and have shelter.

1847
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:24,880
I hear you.

1848
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,480
But you're not clicky clacky, you know.

1849
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,240
Because we're recording this.

1850
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,920
There's, and also I'm not guaranteeing

1851
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,760
I'm taking stuff out.

1852
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,040
So there's, but I definitely hear what you're saying.

1853
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,600
And I will, I'm gonna, lucky me,

1854
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,840
I'm gonna get to spend, you know,

1855
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,000
how many, we're probably about seven hours now total.

1856
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,640
I'm gonna get to go through this all again.

1857
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:50,200
Relive this minus the cigarette smoke.

1858
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,200
So minus like the fucking lung cancer you're giving me.

1859
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,640
I got the fan blowing and went into the door's open.

1860
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,480
Disgusting.

1861
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,240
Okay, so.

1862
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,040
David, prove what, David.

1863
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,880
Yeah, exactly.

1864
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,040
He sound like my wife.

1865
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,120
It's a best piece.

1866
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,960
Jesus, David.

1867
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:10,960
The Marie keeps telling me,

1868
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,440
it's like, David's like your ex-wife.

1869
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,280
He's like a wife.

1870
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,280
My ex-wife?

1871
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,680
No, David's like your wife.

1872
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,520
Sorry.

1873
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,160
Did you talk to David again today?

1874
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,000
Who are you talking to?

1875
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,820
Is it David?

1876
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,360
Kirsten gets sometimes,

1877
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,400
is both with you and with Tom Hayes.

1878
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,520
She like thinks, or has thought that,

1879
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,720
I don't think she's actually thought this,

1880
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,920
but I think it's like occurred to her at points

1881
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,400
that maybe I have a lover.

1882
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,280
Is this valve really a man?

1883
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,120
Is it male valve?

1884
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:39,960
Yeah, I don't.

1885
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,480
That's why she called,

1886
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,520
or she was on the phone the other night.

1887
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,640
No, I think she just like finds you fascinating actually.

1888
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,440
And she read the story, right?

1889
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,280
What story?

1890
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,120
She read your book.

1891
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,640
Yeah, she's read it, but also she's just like,

1892
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,520
you know, lived this with me for the past,

1893
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,800
what, five years, so.

1894
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,360
She is.

1895
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,200
I mean, it's more so.

1896
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,040
Do I anything?

1897
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,880
No, not at all.

1898
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,720
Yeah, I'll get some water.

1899
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,520
I'll pause this for a second, please.

1900
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,360
Bring it up.

1901
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,200
I think it's important.

1902
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,040
Oh, shit, dude.

1903
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,880
That's not an exposure.

1904
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,240
Oh my God, it's stop recording.

1905
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,080
What?

1906
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,840
Okay.

1907
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,560
No, like for a while, yeah.

1908
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,600
I just wanted to reiterate,

1909
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,560
I just think it's a,

1910
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,600
oh, you didn't record that last minute.

1911
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,760
Oh, yeah, I can understand you.

1912
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,600
No, I don't think it's.

1913
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,600
No, that's not gonna happen.

1914
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,600
You don't see this thing.

1915
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,880
All you have to do is to spend some time

1916
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,240
and you should look at it as opposed to

1917
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,080
what's not to be seen as many after you.

1918
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,220
