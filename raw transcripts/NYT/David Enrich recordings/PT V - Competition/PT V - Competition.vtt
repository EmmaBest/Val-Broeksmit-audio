00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Okay, can you hear me? David?

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
It's your station name?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
I think we're all good.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
A little louder?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
I don't want it louder.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Uh, January 26th, 2019.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
That is today.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Five years since your death, Seth.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Yeah.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
How are you feeling?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Uh, shitty.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
It's a terrible day, of course.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
So...

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
How about you?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
What is it that you ever experienced?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
I don't know.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I don't know what's been on your brain.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Five years.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Do you, like, think about the five years?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Like, these annual anniversaries are the most important days to you?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Of course.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Of course, I dread them.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
I don't like this day.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
It's a terrible day.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
It's not only because my dad's death,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
and I have to think about it all over again,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
because I know there's no one I can call or talk to.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
My sisters and my family are all doing something.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And they are, uh, you know, I'm excluded from all that.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
So I usually just go out and try and take my mind off of it various ways.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Like, tonight we have a party scheduled.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
So...

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Yes.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I remember on the first anniversary,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
uh, Andrew did something nice.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
He didn't know that his screening for the Jinx was on the 26th.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I mean, he didn't know the significance of the 26th,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
so he invited me to his screening.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
And I was during the Sony hack,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
and that was why I flew from San Francisco to LA to do that.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Just take my mind off of it.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
The next year, 2015, was pretty miserable.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Um, I spent that at this...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Uh, sorry, 2016 was pretty shitty,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
because I spent that in some hotel room in New York.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Pretty high.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Um, 2017, that was when I met Glenn on that day.

01:51.000 --> 02:03.000
And then in 2018, I was, I think, a hibernation point for most of January last year.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
And then here we are today.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
But around that same time is when we contact each other again to do this project.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
So that was something that always kind of happens around then.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Um, you were around.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You came out...

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I came out, I think it was like a week or two later last year.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
What was it?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I think it was early February, yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, I don't think, I think it was late January.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
But we'll...

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Maybe, it definitely wasn't the 26th,

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
because I think I would have remembered that.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
But I think it was around the 26th when you called and said something about the book.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
No, that was a bit later.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Um...

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Okay.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Anyway...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, it's just miserable time.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I mean, what do you want?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm just...

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, no, you mentioned it all.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
It's a reminder, I haven't solved the mystery as well.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
I haven't figured out what happened.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Um...

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, thank you for spending the day with me.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Thank you for flying out here to, to force it into me that this is definitely the day

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
my dad killed himself and wanted to be here and get this on camera for whatever you have

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
planned for this.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It's very, very kind of you.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I want to come out to see you.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
How about January 26th, pal?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
What do you think about that day?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I mean, it's kind of fun.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
But it's not, but it's fun.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, I like your smirk.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Don't worry.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Don't forget about the camera, dude.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm just...

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
You and I here.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
We're here, buddy.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Let's try and pretend that there's no camera.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
Although it's impossible to do so at some level.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
But if we don't like this, we can delete it.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Let me try again.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah, for sure, man.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
There's...

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Let me go get the computer.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Do you want any more coffee?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
No.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Okay.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No?

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
Let me find out when you came last time.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm pretty sure it was in January.

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
It was in January.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Dude, I'm Rick 2017.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Enrich.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Enrich, sorry, 2018.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I call you by your German proper pronunciation.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
I still say Mueller instead of Muller as well.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
January 18th, you came out...

04:44.000 --> 04:59.000
February 1st.

04:59.000 --> 05:11.000
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah, you came out actually around after my birthday.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Between the 26th and the 14th.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I sent you this on the 25th.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
The thugs.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Why am I...

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Why is this doing this?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
And yes.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
And then I sent you my dad's note to me on the 25th of last year.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
So that was after you came.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I don't think so.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Do you remember this?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
For some reason, my...

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Just doing this weird thing with the emails where they're stacking them up, cancel.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah, on the 25th of January, I sent you my dad's note to me.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah, but I think that was before I came out here.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Sure.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
No, I'm not sure.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
It doesn't really matter.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Okay.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, just for my sense of memory.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
All right, should we get going there?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Sorry?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Okay, so picking up basically where we left off.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Which was, what was the last thing we did?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yesterday.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
So you were in Maine at Sydney's Place and you recorded music.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
You recorded.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah, Sydney's got this great place, like a lair.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
It's not even an apartment.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
It's like this beautiful penthouse with the stairs going up to the...

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It's like an evil James Bond villain lair.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
It's incredible.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
And the great sound, great acoustics in there.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
But yeah, and Sydney was a sort of sweetheart, but she really was very, very kind.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
So she let me stay there and she wasn't there.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Okay, so at this point you've gotten into your mom's emails.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
And you've started, like, piecing stuff together.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
And it, so one of the things you find in there are all these email chains involving the

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
coroner's inquest.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Right.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
And your dad's death.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And this is pretty important.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
I'm not sure if you recognize how important it was at the time, but it's...

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So we find a few things.

07:16.000 --> 07:28.000
One is that we can see in there all of the, like, what the first doctor prescribed.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And we can also see...

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Is it the way they're in?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
I don't know.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
There's sleeping pills or Xanax.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Right.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
There's...

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
And he also refers him to the psychologist, Dr. Mitchell.

07:41.000 --> 07:51.000
And so the coroner said, or the coroner asks both the, like, the physician and the psychologist

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
what lay about his state of mind.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
And so we've got that he explained.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
He was being investigated by the U.S. and the European courts.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
He was extremely anxious.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
We've got...

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
So that's from Moore.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
But it's really Mitchell that is, in a lot of ways, more interesting.

08:10.000 --> 08:20.000
So it recounts how, what he had talked about when he visited and mentioned his career,

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
his problems, his anxieties, his love for his two daughters.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
And that, quote, he was suffering from high levels of anxiety related to investigations

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
into the LIBOR allegations by the U.S. and the U authorities.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
He was catastrophizing, imagining worst case outcomes, including prosecution,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
loss of his wealth, and reputation.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Allen Cloats.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
So that, yeah, he still wants Allen Cloats at his party.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh, yeah, no, but he still wants Allen Cloats at his party.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh, despite LIBOR?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Despite LIBOR.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah, okay, let's, yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
So he's catastrophizing, imagining worst case outcomes, including prosecution,

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
loss of his wealth, and reputation, he's sleeping badly.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And again, this is still quoted from the letter.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
He's constantly preoccupied by those concerns.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
His self-esteem and normal resilience have been greatly undermined as being named a person of interest

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
in the LIBOR case and in the EU investigation.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Okay.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
And then as he leaves Mitchell, Dr. Mitchell gives him his cell phone and asks him to call

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
and office, then calls, bills, several times that fall, try to submit an appointment,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and he never calls back.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
So, okay.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
There's a couple ways to look at it.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
If you look at it, face value, it can mean exactly that, right?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Now, if you know my father, he wasn't one for psychiatrists.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
He didn't go see psychiatrists.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
It wasn't his thing.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
He didn't go to therapy.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
He was not a therapy type person.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yep.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Very rarely he would go.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
And if he did, it was for a purpose.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
And that would be, in my own humble opinion, is to get Xanax, to get drugs.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Because he probably has some anxiety.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
This is a psychologist, not a psychiatrist.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Yes.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
This isn't the one the physician prescribed the drugs.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
This is not someone who would prescribe drugs.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
This is not a prescriber.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
This is a psychologist.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
So Mitchell is not the prescriber.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Moore is the prescriber.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Mitchell is a psychologist, so not someone who would prescribe anything.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Okay.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Well, then maybe take it at face value.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
I just don't understand why he would go and see this guy once or twice.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I mean, without.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
But sometimes you need to see a psychiatrist to get to the prescriber.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Right.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
But this isn't a psychiatrist.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
So I'm sorry.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Sometimes you need to see a therapist to get to the physician.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
No.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So Moore prescribes, Moore is the physician.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Sure.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
And prescribes a bunch of stuff.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Okay.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
And then refers him to a psychologist to kind of talk through his problems.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Okay.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
And, which he does.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Once.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Once.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Once.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
That's it.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
So he goes to the doctor, gets the medications, the doctor says,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
give you the medications on contingency that you go to the physician.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
No, we have no reason to think it was a contingency.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't understand what the issue is here.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Are you, you feel like.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
I don't see my dad going into a therapist once and laying all this upon this guy for.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
You think he just made it up?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
No, I don't think he made it up.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
I think he uses a tool for something else, which I suspect was to get sanics, but you're

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
telling me this is not the prescriber.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
So perhaps the doctor said on contingency of seeing the therapist, I will give you these

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
drugs.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
If you talk to someone else.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Why is it so hard to believe that maybe he just wanted someone to talk to him?

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
Because he would have gone back or he would have continued this relationship.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I mean, he has, I could see him.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
There's like, I don't, I don't negate that position that you're taking him.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Yes.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
Of course, it's good to have someone to talk to and the rest of the families are all

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
psychiatrist anyway, but he never did.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
But why go in for one day just to say this shit and then not come back?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I don't know.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
If he found it there, maybe he just didn't find a therapy at all.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Maybe he tried and thought it was ridiculous or maybe he heard himself say this stuff out

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
loud and thought, oh my God, I am catastrophizing.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
This is ridiculous.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
Well, except that we know that a few months later he kills himself.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
So it's not, I think we can probably stipulate that your dad was like really hurt inside.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
And I mean, I don't take any original discount.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
No, I don't.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Like he said, he's a psychologist.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I don't want to discount it.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
I just don't think it's a smoking gun.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Um, okay.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, do you know what I mean?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Yeah, I definitely know what you mean.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I mean, I don't know about a smoking gun, but it's like.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
If you've been treating this therapist for a year and this is the therapist, the summation

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
of his condition, then yes, okay, that could be more of a smoking gun.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
But if he goes in one time and says this shit.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I don't know, man.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
This isn't a diagnosis.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Come down with another guy for sanics at the same time and get some drugs.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
I mean, who knows?

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, but this isn't, he's not like diagnosing your dad and saying your dad was depressed

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
or your dad was, had an anxiety disorder.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
He's saying that your dad.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Because he can't diagnose.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
He's not.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Right, no.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
He's not a psychiatrist.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
He cannot.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
So he can only write.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
No, no, no.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I think this is his way of diagnosing without saying this is what I think.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Psychologists can make diagnoses.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
They just can't prescribe drugs.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
I also think this guy with psychology thinks he's like a therapist.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
No, he's a psychologist.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
He's a doctor.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
He's with a doctor?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Yes.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Okay.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
He has a PsyD, as they would call it in America, which is a doctorate in psychology.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Okay.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
He's a doctor.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Okay.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
He's, look, but he's not trying to do a diagnosis.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
He only met the guy once.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
That's why I'm insisting to this.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
But he's explaining literally what your dad said to him.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
No, but that's the disconnect, David, because we know that there was absolutely no reason

13:31.000 --> 13:40.000
for him to be culpable any of these in Liber or in Forex trading or any of the scams that

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Deutsche Bank was running.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.660
We know that this was a paradox that he had, fear of being culpable, but knowing he was

13:45.660 --> 13:46.660
not culpable.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.000
That's by definition what the test refers to.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Okay.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
I mean, and again, it's not.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
No one else said this.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
No, it's not true.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Who else said it?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
The doctor said the physician.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
No.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I mean, none of his friends.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We'll get there, because yes, they do.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
They do?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Okay.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
And look, we've already gone over this yesterday, but the Martin Loat had a very similar type.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
I mean, it wasn't about this specifically, but it was, and that's even closer.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
That's in December 2013.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
It's just a month before your dad dies.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
So we know that from a number of sources at this point, we know from the physician, we

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
know from the psychologist, we know from Martin Loat, and we know from the Paul Weiss lawyers

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
who visited, remember who visited in London and sensed that he was really upset and terrified

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
about this investigation.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So around the phone call in the airport.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Right, exactly.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.000
So I mean, we have a pretty, that's four independent data sources that we now have that show that

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
one's leading up to his death.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I just don't know if that equates to suicide.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I mean, I, there's, my dad was 50.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
58.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
57, actually.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
He turned 58.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
He turned 58.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
He turned 58.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
So.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
No, okay.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Sorry.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
But my point is, he has been through this before.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
He's been in these positions of stress.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
This is what he chose for his life, his work to be in his stressful positions, because

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
he managed it very well.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
He's a risk fucking manager.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
He could just substitute the word stress for risk.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Right.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
That's what he did.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
So I mean, I don't see.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
That is one of the things I find interesting.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Well, but we know he did commit suicide.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
So it's, there's, but there's a possibility of false equivalency.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
What do you mean?

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
He just says, you know, I don't equivocate, equivocate that to suicide.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
He said, but we know he did commit suicide.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Right.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
You're right.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
That doesn't automatically mean that that's what caused it.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
But there's, let's keep going.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
I understand.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
You know what I mean?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I do.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
I've been resisting to this since 2014.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
I know you have.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
And that's really interesting to me because there's, I mean, look, just to be like personal

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
about this, like I come from a family.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
My mom's a psychologist.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Like, you know, I've seen therapists over the years.

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
I, to me, that's not, there's no like stigma in my brain about people who need help because

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
they're going through a struggle.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
They're struggling.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Like sometimes it's an illness.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Sometimes it's just like a tough time to go through.

16:30.000 --> 16:38.000
There's overwhelming evidence here that your dad was going through a really tough time

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
and that he was what he was like communicating to the people around him was that the, a lot,

16:44.000 --> 16:53.000
maybe not all of the toughness, but a lot of it was because he was really anxious about

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
stuff that was going on at work.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
And I mean, again, that's really clear.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I mean, yes, I don't disregard that.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I don't disregard that.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
And I accept that.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
Holy, but I just don't, I just, there's something that has to cross the line to suicide.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Clearly.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't see that yet.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Okay.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So, okay, well, let's keep going.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
I mean, I think your theory is that it's just compounds and compounds and compounds and

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
at some point there's a line that crosses or something breaks and then the suicide.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And then you lead the path to suicide.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I just don't see the breaking point yet.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I haven't found it.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
I mean, maybe it's the work stuff compounding with family stuff.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
You know, maybe, because my mom, of course, is not the easiest person to deal with either.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I think you're thinking about this.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
I don't look too literal away.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Or, you know, I'm not the easiest person to deal with.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
You know, my sister, there could be a bunch of shit compounded, but I just don't see the

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
line.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I don't see where it broke.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
And if you're bringing up in August of 2013, he's asking Scott Mitchell about estate planning.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
I mean, you're alluding to the fact that he's already considering suicide at this point.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
I don't know about that.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Why are you bringing it up?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I didn't bring it up.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
You're dead.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
You brought it up in the book.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Why else did you put it into the book?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Because it seems relevant.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
It seems relevant.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
It seems relevant.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Right.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Because you are alluding to the fact that he's considering ending his life by this point in

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
time.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
He's thinking about his demise.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I don't think he's necessary.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I mean, I don't know what is going on.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
I said, all I know, I unfortunately never met your dad.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
And there's, so all I can do is look at the available evidence that people have talked

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
to and the documentary evidence that you've compiled and shared with me.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Anyway, so let's keep, I understand what you're saying.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
That's fine.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
We don't need to go into resolution numbers.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Okay.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
So, okay.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
To me actually, obviously it's very interesting that the glimpse of a right into your dad's

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
state of mind.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
But what's more interesting to me, where I was kind of heading with this, is that it's

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Deutsche Bank's efforts to cover up what actually happened.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Okay.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
So the coroner schedules this inquest for March 25th.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Okay.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
A few days beforehand, she informs the bank and its lawyers and the lawyers that the bank

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
has hired for your family.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
And she says how she's going to conduct the hearing.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
And among other things, she's going to read aloud portions of the doctor's letters to

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
both the physician and-

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
And you were there this year?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
No, I wasn't at the coroner's.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Oh, Jenny was there?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
No, I can't remember who was there.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
But it doesn't matter.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
This is all coming from documents that you've showed me.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Okay.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
So we know that she is planning to read aloud portions of these letters about the include,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
that are primarily about the anxiety of your dad's suffering.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Oh, right.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Relate to the government.

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
There was a controversy because he said the coroner revealed the history of depression

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
in the family.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah, but that's, again, that's not really what I'm interested in.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
What I'm interested in, I'll tell you.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
So noon on March 24th, so this is the day before the hearing that's supposed to occur, someone

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
in the coroner's office, her name is Fiona Wilkner, someone in her office calls one of the lawyers

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
that the bank has hired, informs the lawyer that there will be no reference whatsoever

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
to Bill being under investigation.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
That's a quote.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Say that one more time.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
There will be, quote, no reference whatsoever to Bill being under investigation.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Okay.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
So that night, March 24th, Wilcox, who's a coroner, she spends the evening looking at

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
the files, going over the inquest files, and she concludes that her obligation is to the

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
truth and not to the bank and not to the family, and that therefore she needs to tell the court

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
everything that's known about the circumstances of his death.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And that includes the fact that he was very scared about these investigations.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
And so the next morning, she arrives at the Royal Court of Justice, meets with the lawyers

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
for your family and for Deutsche Bank, and tells them that she is in fact going to be

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
quoted from the doctor's letters extensively.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Okay.

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
So the lawyers, and seems like they went kind of bananas and they protest that we had just

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
been told the opposite the previous day, and quote, she reminded, so one of the lawyers

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
there sums this up.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
She says she, being the coroner, reminded me that by law she was under a duty to investigate

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
all deaths, fearlessly and without favor.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Ultimately, though, it seems that the lawyers kind of wore her down because she agrees

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
to a compromise.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
And the compromise is that she's going to read the doctor's letters aloud in court,

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
but she's going to read a censored or modified edited version.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Right.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
And so what the lawyers do-

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
The redacted one, I see.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Yeah, well, it's like weird.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
They take a pink highlighter and they cross stuff out.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
And so-

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I see in both versions.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
They're unredacted.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Absolutely in both versions.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
So let me just go through how this looks to someone who hasn't been immersed in this.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
So he told the psychologists they had been named as a person of interest.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
That's cut.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Okay.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Where Mitchell had written that Bill, quote, imagined being investigated, being prosecuted,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
losing his wealth in his reputation, those words get crossed out and they're replaced

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
with, he imagined, various issues.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Okay.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Moore's letter, so Moore's the physician.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
It's described that Bill had, quote, was worried about going to prison or going to bankrupt

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
even though he knew he was innocent.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
He kept on thinking back over all the thousands of emails he sent over the years.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
He knew how lawyers can twist things around and was worried that they would take extract from

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
emails.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
So that's a quote from Moore's letter.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
That's all deleted and replaced with the following sentences.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Oh, okay.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Quote, he told me that he'd been extremely anxious.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
He explained he was retiring in September.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
So in other words, these fairly clear explanations about what had been going on inside or what

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
your dad had told the doctor and the psychologist or crossed out and it basically replaced with

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
this very sterile language that just says he was anxious.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
As if the bank, as if the bank got in there with that pink highlighter.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
The bank do get in there with the highlighter.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Yeah.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Those were lawyers hired by the bank.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
To do that.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Well, I don't know.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
She caved, she caved.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Yeah, she caved.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
And so the...

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I didn't know that.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
I didn't know that the bank commissioned that pink highlighter.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Yes.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I didn't know that.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
I mean, the lawyers are ostensibly, some of them are ostensibly working on your family's

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
behalf and they're paid for it by the bank.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Christian suit, saving.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
What was that?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Suit.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Seven.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
What about him though?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Once he's suing.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Because he was the lead lawyer at that time.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, but well, was he at that time?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm not sure he was at that.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I don't think he had...

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Remember the memo?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
No, but that's a year later.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
And we're going to get there, don't worry.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Okay.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
But so to me, put this in bucket one, which is that this is pretty clear evidence of...

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Yes.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Yes.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I mean, it really is.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
They're taking this very clear language from two doctors who say this is what you got.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Yeah, I got it.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
You're right.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
I didn't know that they did that.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I thought that was something that the...

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
I thought they wanted to stay neutral, the corner, and like they didn't want to...

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
They just wanted...

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
The point was he killed himself and they were just trying to say he's dead and this is our

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
report, nothing to do with the reasons why they didn't want to get into that.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
If you go through these emails that went back and forth, they explained in great detail exactly

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
how this went down.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
I didn't know that.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Okay.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah, show me that.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
You forgot.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
No, no.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Between the bank and Wilcox.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
No, no, no.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
It's not.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
It's the memos that go back and forth that you fished out of your mom's files.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Oh, I thought you had something between the bank and Wilcox.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
The lawyers are hired by the bank.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I know about communications between Wilcox and the bank.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
We have reports that you showed me that show the lawyer.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
I know those reports.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I mean something additional to that.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
No, that's from there, man.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Oh, I know.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Okay.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
So next, let's move on.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
So why was your dad so worried about the live one investigation?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
It is an obvious question, right?

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
He said this to both doctors and the bank obviously seems like it does not want that coming out

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
in the court.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
So why?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Why was he so scared?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
So this brings us to Mark Stein.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
So you found in your dad's files an email from Mark Stein.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
He's the lawyer at Simpson Thatcher, which is a very high price corporate law firm.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And you can tell that your father is pretty worried.

25:09.000 --> 25:16.000
He keeps asking or at least on one or two occasions asks Stein what's going on with DOJ.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Stein replies total silence.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
He's a slippery fuck.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
That guy called me a few times.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah, tell him.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I told you, remember?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
I did not.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I called him a few times and I asked to talk to him.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I said, hello.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Very sorry to hear about your dad.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
There was absolutely nothing going on with him.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
He wasn't under any investigations.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
When we called him in, it was just sort of like a cattle call.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
You know, sometimes these regulators, they're calling thousands of bankers at a time.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
They're looking for stuff.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
And that's all that this was about.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
And I said to him, excuse me, but I have fucking emails between you two saying, please send me this file

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
because it's important.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And then he stopped communicating.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And then he never calls me back.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Wait, no.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
And then I call him again and I say, well, can we talk about Faisola and Mikaela Faisola?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And he says, yes, I'd love to talk about this.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Let's set up a date and time.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Phone tag for three fucking months.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
No response.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Emails.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah, he clearly did not want to talk to you.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
So I think you already know this, but the reason your dad was involved in this live or investigation

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
is not that he had done anything.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
He hadn't participated in any fraud or manipulation.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Chief risk guy.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
No, it's that he missed something.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Oh, really?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
So back in 2009, Christian Bittar, who was a big live or trader.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I remember this from your book.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Yeah.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Well, I don't think this was actually in the book.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
There's another Deutsche Bank guy, Gio Madoff.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Oh, no, I remember this from your search terms.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Yes.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Yes.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
That's right.

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
So Bittar back in 2009 was due.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
And Anshu Jain had agreed.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Wasn't he recently arrested?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
He was recently sentenced to jail.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Sent to jail?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Yeah.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
So he pleaded guilty to fraud.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
So he, at the time, though, Anshu Jain had worked at a very lucrative contract for Christian Bittar.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
This is, again, back 10 years ago.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
He was the one from his desk when it was like 500 million?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Yeah.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
They were making an absolute killing.

27:20.000 --> 27:28.000
Anshu had agreed to a compensation arrangement where Bittar would basically take home a portion of his winnings.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
And so he won a lot.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
In part, Bittar's obviously was manipulating.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
What's his percentage?

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
I don't know what the percentage was off the top of my head, but I do know what he was owed, roughly.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
So he was due to get a bonus in the neighborhood of 50 or 60 or 70 million dollars.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Wow.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
It's about 5%.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
That was...

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It was about 500 million, wasn't it?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah, so that'd be 10%.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I think it probably was about 10%.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
But I'm not certain about that.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
In any case, that's a huge amount of money to just hand out to a trader.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
And so there were a couple of reviews that were started internally into...

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
People were kind of dispatched to look at how he had made all that money.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
So there's one review called a review by the Business Integrity Review Group, which was a loan employee at Deutsche

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
sent to go through Bittar's emails.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
And Bittar's friend, or I think it was from Senegal.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So he's a native French speaker.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
And the guy who was assigned to go through this doesn't even speak French, so they can't understand any of the communications.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
But Anshu asked your dad to take a look as well.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
And your dad did what's called a look-back.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
And he's supposed to go in there and figure out if everything was above board,

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
and the profits were legitimate as opposed to being the result of fraud or manipulation or something like that.

28:43.000 --> 28:50.000
And so your dad spent a couple of weeks going through all the financial data and interviewing traders on Bittar's team.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
And his conclusion is a very narrowly crafted conclusion.

28:55.000 --> 29:06.000
It was that Bittar and his traders had a plausible strategy to make money off of interest rates moving in very specific directions,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
by very specific amounts.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
And he stopped short of addressing the question of whether Bittar was manipulated live,

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
or he basically gave a blessing for this bonus to get paid for Bittar to be able to continue doing business.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
And this turns in as a huge mistake in retrospect.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
Bittar is engaged in what turns out to be a large, very lucrative criminal conspiracy.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
And that's going to result in the bank paying billions of dollars in penalties.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
And then people going to jail.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.000
And the Justice Department at that point, so this is now in 2013,

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
so four years later, has started this, a number of investigations, including into Deutsche,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
which was in the process of drawing a criminal charge against people.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
And so there, your dad was under the impression he was a person of interest in this investigation.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
And, you know, there's no reason to think he was going to have really good in trouble,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
but could his reputation be severely damaged?

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Could he have huge legal fees? That's not impossible.

30:14.000 --> 30:23.000
So that is my understanding of why your dad was so worried about live war.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So why did he make this mistake?

30:26.000 --> 30:33.000
Is there anybody, if you've spoken to anyone that said maybe he didn't look at all the documents,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
did he have some sort of...

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
One theory I have, and we'll get to this later, is that,

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
and we know now what your dad wrote in his note to auction, right?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Oh, right.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
He talks about carelessness, and sloppiness, and betraying his trust.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
Betraying his trust, yeah.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
And it, I don't know. I mean, it's, I don't know what those words mean,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
but this is one possibility.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
It seems like.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Okay.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Okay.

30:59.000 --> 31:06.000
So, a year later, so this is now early 2015, a guy named Victor Rocco.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
It's just a Deutsche Bank's office at 60 Wall Street.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
And Rocco is someone who had been introduced to your mom a couple weeks after your dad's death.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
And he's a lawyer. He's a former federal prosecutor, turned private lawyer.

31:19.000 --> 31:26.000
And he is going there to have this meeting with Christian Seven and Simon Dodds,

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
who's another very senior lawyer at the bank, about this internal review that they had conducted

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
into the circumstances of your dad's death.

31:34.000 --> 31:42.000
And it, again, you know this already, but there's, there turns out there's a very, like,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
you know, kind of narrative explanation of what went on in that meeting.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Okay.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
And it, and again, this is something you've shared with me, so you can know this already,

31:50.000 --> 31:59.000
but Seven starts off by noting that he had been at the farewell lunch that Antje had hosted for Bill

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
back in November of 2013, and that Bill had seemed happy.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
No signs of him being a guy who's going to kill himself in two months.

32:08.000 --> 32:15.000
And then Seven and Dodds walk the lawyer, Rocco, through this review,

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
and they acknowledge that the LIBOR investigation might have caused him some heartburn,

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
and he might have had some legal exposure there.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
We're talking about the memo.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Yes, this is the memo.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
And then the guy breathes through this laundry list of other issues that Bill had been dealing with,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
and there's DBTCA and the huge mess there.

32:34.000 --> 32:40.000
They oddly assert that Bill, quote, was not responsible for DBTCA,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
even though he was a member of the oversight board.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
In which scam was this referring to?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
The basket trades?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
DBTCA?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Yeah.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
Well, DBTCA, the biggest issue there was that the Federal Reserve was,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
I mean, DBTCA was kind of a dumping ground for all these problems,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
and so basket trades were there.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
The Russian mirror trades, which have another separate investigation, are there.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
The biggest concern, though, is that the financial data that DBTCA has produced into the Fed,

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
the New York Fed, is just like sloppy and wrong,

33:15.000 --> 33:21.000
and the Fed, they're kind of pulling the wool over the regulator's eyes on the stress tests.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
So there's a lot of problems there.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
The review also looks at what impact, if any, Boffin's rejection of Bill for those promotions,

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
what effect those had on him, and the conclusion is that it didn't affect him at all.

33:37.000 --> 33:44.000
It turns out, so the bank produces a report that is kind of summarizing conclusions,

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
and the report is very sensitive.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
It's only shared with a few members of the bank's board of directors.

33:51.000 --> 33:59.000
A number of board members complained to the bank's chairman that they were not allowed to see the report into the death,

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
and one of them told me that, quote, I was very suspicious.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
And when Rocco goes there, he doesn't get to see it either.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
He gets kind of a snippet of, he gets kind of a summary of what it found,

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
and the summary is that, quote, nothing that shows a direct link between Bill's death and his work at Deutsche Bank.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Of course you're going to say that.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
And aren't you commissioned this?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Yeah.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
You did?

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Yeah.

34:26.000 --> 34:34.000
And so one of the kind of things they used to validate, just kind of questionable premise,

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
is that seven notes that in the months since the internal review wrapped up,

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
Bill's name hadn't come up in public, connected to any of these investigations.

34:43.000 --> 34:51.000
And, of course, that's not true, because he had been named publicly in the Senate report into the basket options.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
And so Rocco notes, when he summarizes this meaning to your mom,

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
that this suggests the Deutsche Investigation, quote, was not as exhaustive,

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
not as dynamic as both Dodd and Seven had described it.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
He notes that it, quote, it seemed carefully scripted,

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
and certainly both Simon and Christian were very careful in what they said to me.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Down played his involvement in a bunch of things,

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
and Simon, Seven and Dodd's, quote, could not explain the coroner's findings

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
or the medical records that established that Bill was fearful of civil liability

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
and perhaps even prosecution because of his work at the bank.

35:25.000 --> 35:33.000
So now we've got, from my perspective, at least two data points that point to the bank really not being,

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
at best not being very transparent about what happened at worst, participating in a whitewash.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Yeah, I know you're right.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
And then in the memo, they also randomly bring up

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
that they did not take these files from my father's computer.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah, and I'm just not even addressing that in the book, honestly.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Like, there's...

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Why?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Well, I'm addressing that they did take them.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
But why not address the fact that they claim they did not?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
I mean, that's very odd.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
It is odd, right?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
It is odd.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
It is odd.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
I agree.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I mean, is that not another data point for you?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Yeah, maybe it is.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Maybe it is.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I mean, we have witnesses that this guy came.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
There's many...

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
No, I know.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
And Beth...

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
It wasn't just me.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
No, I know.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
Dude, if it was just you, I probably wouldn't be trusting your memory at that point.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
No, because you were just like, it was very traumatic for you.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Yes, it was traumatic.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Beth confirms it.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
I remember Beth confirms it.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Michael Morandi, he'll confirm it for you as well.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
He was there.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Beth confirms it.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
That's all I need.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Okay.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
And there's...

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Yeah.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Yeah.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
So...

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
But why not put that in the book?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Yeah, I hear you.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
No particular reason.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Okay.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
We'll make a note there, David.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Put it in the book.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
This is all being recorded, man.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Clickety-clack into your fingers.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Clickety-clack.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Clickety-clack.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Chop, chop.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Come on.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
All right.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Okay, so you know what?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
I'm actually just going to pause this for a sec.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Yeah.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
And...

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Should I pause this, too?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
You don't matter.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
I just want to break up these files a little bit.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Right.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
It's too big.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Okay.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Um...

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Well, Marie just texted.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
She's on her way.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
She's going to clean the car.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
You doing okay?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Uh, she's sick, so she bombed in the car.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Who did?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Marie.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Marie bombed it in the car.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
No, I mean, she pulled over to vomit.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Wow.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
That's not good.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Do you have this...

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Stomach logo on there?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
I don't know.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Okay.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Okay.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Okay.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Okay.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Okay.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Okay.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Okay.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Okay.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Okay.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Okay.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Okay.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Okay.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Okay.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Okay.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Okay.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Okay.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
I don't know.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Bomber to the street.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
I feel better.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
I ate something and I didn't vomit.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Um, she's going to go clean the car.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
She'll be right back.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.060
She'll be back looking 30 minutes.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.060
Okay.

37:47.060 --> 37:48.000
I don't know, if she's okay.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.500
I think she'll be okay.

37:49.500 --> 37:56.000
It must have been food poisoning, or...

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
You want me to go?

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Let's go already, alright.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Okay.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Um, that's interesting.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Yeah, that's kind of fun.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.440
It's interesting, I just think that-

38:04.440 --> 38:06.680
Wait, can we wait and turn this on before you start?

38:06.680 --> 38:07.680
Yeah, right, yeah.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.080
Yeah, David, I think it's,

38:16.120 --> 38:18.480
it is a good data points,

38:18.480 --> 38:22.640
but I really think it's important to add this bit here.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.000
Because not only they're accusing me of lying,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.800
but they're trying to cover something up

38:27.800 --> 38:30.360
that is absurd to do so

38:30.360 --> 38:34.120
when there are witnesses that can verify this guy's existence.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.600
Okay, so now, yeah, no, I hear,

38:37.600 --> 38:39.280
I mean, I'm not sure how important it is,

38:39.280 --> 38:40.240
but I definitely see your point,

38:40.240 --> 38:41.680
and there's no particular reason that's not in there.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.960
Why are you saying you're not sure how important it is?

38:43.960 --> 38:45.280
It's just that they are just-

38:45.280 --> 38:46.840
It's like-

38:46.840 --> 38:47.920
To me, what's the important part

38:47.920 --> 38:52.000
is that they took the files, not that they're,

38:52.000 --> 38:52.840
I don't know.

38:52.840 --> 38:53.680
I hear what you're saying.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.520
I don't feel strongly about this.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.600
Let's not bicker about this,

38:55.600 --> 38:57.520
because there's, I definitely see what you're saying.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.360
I don't want to bicker.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.680
There's no particular reason why not.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.800
I just honestly want to understand

39:00.800 --> 39:04.040
why you think it's not a big deal.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.280
Because to me, it is a big deal.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.480
I'm not saying that it is,

39:06.480 --> 39:07.800
I'm fighting with you to say what it is.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.640
I just want to know in your head, why is it not-

39:10.640 --> 39:12.640
That they're denying that they took it?

39:12.640 --> 39:13.980
Yeah, yeah.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.760
Because I don't know why they denied it.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.600
Like, maybe Kristen Southern just didn't know, for example.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.680
Like, I mean, I don't know.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.520
There's, the important part from my perspective

39:23.520 --> 39:24.360
is that they took it.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.480
And there's plenty of evidence at this point.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.240
But if you didn't know why we put it into the,

39:28.240 --> 39:32.280
why even take the time to put it into this very heavily-

39:32.280 --> 39:34.360
But that memo is not what they produced, right?

39:34.360 --> 39:37.640
That's what the lawyer for your mom produced.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.520
And so we don't know how much emphasis they gave it.

39:39.520 --> 39:42.720
Again, I don't really disagree with you to be honest with you.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.320
So there's, maybe it does belong in there.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.600
So, okay.

39:47.600 --> 39:52.440
So, we now switch over to Mododipasky for a moment.

39:52.440 --> 39:53.280
Great.

39:53.920 --> 39:58.200
And so, the way I've framed this here,

39:58.200 --> 40:00.880
that you're about to discover another reason that your dad

40:00.880 --> 40:03.520
isn't feeling bad about stuff from the non-affected bank.

40:03.520 --> 40:09.520
So, and one of the things you find in your father's Yahoo account

40:09.520 --> 40:13.680
is that Bill had repeatedly warned his colleagues

40:13.680 --> 40:17.000
that these Mododipasky transactions were very risky.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.720
And it's not like financial risk,

40:18.720 --> 40:20.720
so much as reputational risk for the bank.

40:20.720 --> 40:27.960
And he had, like one time after another, cautioned Faisola.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.160
He'd asked that this be elevated to Anshu.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.240
And just no one listened.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.920
By the way, I've learned that,

40:35.920 --> 40:37.520
I should have mentioned this earlier.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.120
So, you're going to kick it out of this.

40:39.120 --> 40:45.400
Anshu had a nephew who worked at Deutsche Bank.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.720
And you know, the guy, some of Anshu's colleagues

40:48.720 --> 40:52.920
felt quite a bit of pressure to find jobs for this guy inside the bank.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.320
Guess what job he landed on, actually.

40:55.320 --> 41:02.640
He was one of the guys exporting this Mododipasky style transaction

41:02.640 --> 41:04.120
to other banks around the world.

41:04.120 --> 41:04.640
Really?

41:04.640 --> 41:05.240
Yeah.

41:05.240 --> 41:09.440
So, they use Mododipasky transactions.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.000
One of the reasons this is so lucrative, right?

41:11.000 --> 41:14.160
They use it as a model for things they could do with other banks.

41:14.160 --> 41:14.680
What?

41:14.680 --> 41:17.840
How is that, what, just to overpay?

41:17.840 --> 41:20.920
Well, no, they're basically the...

41:20.920 --> 41:23.480
To buy up the debt and overpay for something?

41:23.480 --> 41:24.240
No, no, no, no.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.600
The MoneyDipasky transaction at its heart is,

41:26.600 --> 41:28.000
and again, I think you probably know this already,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.320
but there is, it's...

41:30.320 --> 41:33.360
So, MoneyDipasky is facing really big losses on these derivatives

41:33.360 --> 41:35.720
that Deutsche Bank had cooked up years earlier.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.800
And so, they create these new class of derivatives

41:37.800 --> 41:39.520
that in the very short term,

41:39.520 --> 41:42.200
is going to send a bunch of money to Mododipasky,

41:42.200 --> 41:45.440
which allows them to pretend to kind of conceal the losses

41:45.440 --> 41:46.520
that they would otherwise be facing.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.400
Is the Antivenet apart?

41:48.400 --> 41:49.240
No, Antivenet...

41:49.240 --> 41:50.600
That's Santorini.

41:50.600 --> 41:51.480
That's Santorini.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.520
Antivenet, just get that out of your head.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.000
There's the...

41:56.000 --> 42:00.200
So, it gives a short-term cash infusion to MoneyDipasky

42:00.200 --> 42:02.400
so that they can pretend they didn't actually lose all this money

42:02.400 --> 42:03.920
that they really did lost.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.400
But then, over the next several years,

42:05.400 --> 42:08.640
they have to pay back that money to Deutsche Bank

42:08.640 --> 42:10.320
through these other transactions.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.600
And as long as they're very profitable,

42:12.600 --> 42:14.160
no one will overnet.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.640
Obviously, that doesn't work out that way.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.080
Anyway, that means the debt just sort of floats

42:18.080 --> 42:21.320
without being landing on any books for a while.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.360
Yeah, kind of.

42:25.320 --> 42:29.800
So, it now becomes clear inside the bank

42:29.800 --> 42:32.240
that they're using similar transactions,

42:32.240 --> 42:35.120
model in the Mododipasky one, for other banks

42:35.120 --> 42:38.680
in places like Brazil and, I forget where else,

42:38.680 --> 42:39.680
but a couple other places.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.960
I'm using nephew.

42:40.960 --> 42:41.800
Yeah.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.040
And your dad warns that these, quote,

42:46.040 --> 42:47.520
may be a rounding error at this point,

42:47.520 --> 42:49.000
but they're growing quickly.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.240
Well, that's strange, also,

42:50.240 --> 42:54.000
because Anshu claims that he never signed off on this deal,

42:54.000 --> 42:54.840
or this...

42:54.840 --> 42:55.680
Yeah, that's...

42:55.680 --> 42:57.400
I don't know if Anshu signed off on it or not,

42:57.400 --> 42:58.720
that he certainly was aware of it.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.560
Right.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.200
And he had the concerns escalated to him.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.040
Yeah.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.200
I don't know if he's actually said he was not aware of it.

43:04.200 --> 43:06.320
I think that's what Dirk told me.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.080
But, you know, that's not, that's...

43:08.080 --> 43:08.920
Right.

43:08.920 --> 43:09.760
That's not...

43:09.760 --> 43:10.600
Okay.

43:10.720 --> 43:11.560
Okay.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.560
Sorry, Dirk.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.000
And so this, I note here, is,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.720
this is a very reminiscent of Warren's County.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.560
Yeah.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.160
Where your dad sees these derivative transactions

43:23.160 --> 43:26.880
piling up, they look really bad to him.

43:26.880 --> 43:27.720
Yeah.

43:27.720 --> 43:29.680
He, like, warns in writing repeatedly,

43:29.680 --> 43:30.600
and no one listens.

43:30.600 --> 43:33.120
And, sure enough, this, as you know,

43:33.120 --> 43:34.640
blows up in Deutsche Bank's face.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.600
And one of the pieces of evidence that's then used

43:37.600 --> 43:39.680
against the bank and against Faisola

43:39.720 --> 43:42.760
is the fact that your dad had warned in writing.

43:42.760 --> 43:43.600
His memories.

43:43.600 --> 43:44.440
Yeah.

43:44.440 --> 43:45.280
Exactly.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.480
It's very similar to Warren's County in that regard.

43:46.480 --> 43:51.320
And how does that, and Faisola and his wife

43:51.320 --> 43:55.480
are obviously close friends of your father and mother.

43:55.480 --> 43:59.080
And your dad's gotta be feeling

44:00.200 --> 44:01.960
like a little bit guilty about that, I imagine,

44:01.960 --> 44:04.120
because he, he...

44:04.120 --> 44:04.960
But he told Faisola, no.

44:04.960 --> 44:05.800
He wrote.

44:05.800 --> 44:06.640
He told Faisola, no.

44:06.640 --> 44:07.480
Yeah, right.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.400
But now the thing that he put in writing

44:09.400 --> 44:13.560
is being used to gin up criminal charges

44:13.560 --> 44:14.640
against his good friend.

44:16.320 --> 44:21.320
You know, the criminal charges came way later after his death.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.080
That's true, but the criminal investigation

44:24.080 --> 44:25.880
was well underway, and it was clear at that point

44:25.880 --> 44:28.720
that these emails that your dad had sent

44:28.720 --> 44:30.840
warning were going to be a problem.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.520
They were a crucial piece of evidence.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.240
That showed that not only was the bank doing something naughty,

44:36.240 --> 44:38.800
but the bank knew that what it was doing was naughty.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.760
I mean, that's...

44:40.760 --> 44:41.600
Okay.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.600
Look, that doesn't mean,

44:43.600 --> 44:45.120
that doesn't mean that could prove anything to us.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.280
No, I don't, my brain goes directly

44:47.280 --> 44:48.680
just Faisola's showing up today.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.520
My mother's saying, call McKaley, call McKaley.

44:51.520 --> 44:52.360
So...

44:52.360 --> 44:54.440
Yeah, I'm not sure there's anything to that other than

44:54.440 --> 44:55.920
that they were friends and lived nearby.

44:55.920 --> 44:57.680
Just putting out there, this is a tangent

44:57.680 --> 44:59.280
that my mind went to.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.560
Well, the tangent my mind goes to is that

45:01.560 --> 45:03.600
you around this time, having found all the stuff

45:03.600 --> 45:06.920
in both of your parents' emails, you emailed Faisola.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.840
And you asked him why he thought

45:09.840 --> 45:10.880
your dad had killed himself.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.240
And Faisola initially deflects the question

45:14.240 --> 45:16.680
and suggests that you not read too much

45:16.680 --> 45:20.400
into reports of Bill being under investigation.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.200
And he says, quote, unfortunately, we live in a world

45:23.200 --> 45:25.000
where banks are perceived as evil.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.880
And therefore, senior people are unfairly attacked

45:26.880 --> 45:29.440
by the media, politicians and regulators.

45:29.440 --> 45:33.600
And you keep pressing and Faisola eventually

45:33.600 --> 45:35.000
offers a more complete theory

45:35.000 --> 45:37.320
about what had been going on inside your dad's head.

45:37.320 --> 45:40.840
And it is, quote, I do not think that depression

45:40.840 --> 45:42.880
was caused by a specific work situation,

45:42.880 --> 45:45.080
but definitely work has contributed to it.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.920
And in the last few years, the whole industry

45:46.920 --> 45:49.280
has entered a very difficult and dark time.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.560
We all got attacked and vilified.

45:51.560 --> 45:53.640
I think he realized the end of his generation

45:53.640 --> 45:55.280
of managers was approaching.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.160
And maybe he could not deal with it.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.000
Definitely the fact that in the last two years,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.440
he did not have a clear job due to boffin opposition

46:01.440 --> 46:02.920
did not help.

46:02.920 --> 46:03.760
So...

46:03.800 --> 46:05.200
I just didn't like that he blamed boffin.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.480
He blamed that the thing that everyone else wants to blame

46:07.480 --> 46:10.040
is that he didn't get the, that they blocked him.

46:10.040 --> 46:10.880
I didn't like that.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.720
And I don't like the fact that he's vilified.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.720
I think this is a pretty...

46:13.720 --> 46:14.960
He's saying he's being vilified

46:14.960 --> 46:16.840
and he's saying my dad's being vilified.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.680
And that...

46:17.680 --> 46:18.920
Well, he's saying a lot more than that.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.520
He's saying bankers are being vilified.

46:20.520 --> 46:21.480
That's the first thing he says.

46:21.480 --> 46:22.960
That's not the second thing he's saying.

46:22.960 --> 46:27.080
He says that there's...

46:27.080 --> 46:29.680
He's really saying that, first of all, your dad was depressed.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.320
Second of all, there wasn't a specific thing.

46:31.320 --> 46:32.440
There was just all of this.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.680
There were all these investigations.

46:34.680 --> 46:36.360
He's saying, I think he realized

46:36.360 --> 46:37.880
the end of the generation of managers

46:37.880 --> 46:39.520
was approaching and maybe he could not deal with it.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.840
That's fine, Donna, I accept.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.160
Which reminds me a lot of what we talked about yesterday.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.560
Yeah, with the Dixon fuckers.

46:46.560 --> 46:49.480
The Troy Dixon gang of sheds.

46:49.480 --> 46:52.760
So this is all beginning to make a little bit more sense

46:52.760 --> 46:53.600
to me at this point.

46:53.600 --> 46:55.880
And honestly, I think it was making a little more sense

46:55.880 --> 46:56.920
to you at the time too, if I recall.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.520
This theory is, yes.

46:59.680 --> 47:00.800
Okay.

47:00.800 --> 47:01.640
So.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.000
This one theory, because there are others.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.480
But yes, it makes a little sense.

47:07.480 --> 47:08.720
Wait, sorry.

47:08.720 --> 47:09.760
What's one theory?

47:11.000 --> 47:14.960
That this isn't him feeling like it's out of control

47:14.960 --> 47:16.960
because he's a generational thing

47:16.960 --> 47:18.080
and now he doesn't...

47:18.080 --> 47:19.600
People aren't listening to him anymore.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.680
He's not the...

47:23.400 --> 47:25.640
The statue he had before is the voice of reason

47:25.640 --> 47:27.600
where everyone was worshiping him as he asked,

47:27.600 --> 47:28.440
Bill, what do we do here?

47:28.440 --> 47:29.280
What do we do here?

47:29.280 --> 47:31.200
He's being disrespected.

47:31.200 --> 47:34.760
He's being circumvented.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.840
You know, how have I missed this?

47:39.840 --> 47:41.360
I don't know.

47:41.360 --> 47:46.360
But I've missed here is your dad's notes.

47:48.320 --> 47:49.160
How did we...

47:50.240 --> 47:51.720
Because that's when you were at the university club.

47:51.720 --> 47:52.880
Yeah.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.040
Did we go over that yesterday?

47:54.040 --> 47:54.880
Yeah.

47:54.880 --> 47:55.720
Oh, we did, okay.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.320
Yeah, you were, I'm sorry.

47:58.360 --> 48:01.000
So just to reread Anshu's, his note to Anshu now,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.240
because I think that's helpful for Remake,

48:03.240 --> 48:05.720
continuing to keep in mind the framing of all this

48:05.720 --> 48:07.400
in his mind at the time.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.880
She says, Anshu, you were so good to me

48:09.880 --> 48:12.240
and I've repaid you with carelessness.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.480
I've betrayed your trust

48:13.480 --> 48:15.760
and hid my horrible nature from you.

48:15.760 --> 48:19.080
I can't even begin to fathom the damage I have done.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.400
I am eternally sorry and condemned.

48:21.400 --> 48:24.120
And then we combine that, take that,

48:24.120 --> 48:26.560
which raises obviously a ton of questions.

48:26.560 --> 48:30.560
Take that with this nugget from the note he left

48:30.560 --> 48:33.320
to your mom and it says, even my career,

48:33.320 --> 48:37.400
which was once a source of pride, ended anonymously.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.000
I look back at it with shame,

48:39.000 --> 48:42.080
another gift that I was careless with and poisoned.

48:42.080 --> 48:45.120
My role as a director of DBTCA is burdensome

48:45.120 --> 48:47.320
and something I'm not suited for.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.200
However, I have to pretend to enjoy it

48:49.200 --> 48:52.080
because it is my only remaining source of status.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.360
I can't look back, I can't look forward.

48:56.760 --> 48:58.240
So that's some heavy shit.

48:58.240 --> 49:00.200
But just fucking be careful with that

49:00.200 --> 49:02.040
because you're taking the ramblings of a guy

49:02.040 --> 49:03.960
that's kind of lost and gone over the edge

49:03.960 --> 49:06.160
just before he kills himself.

49:06.160 --> 49:09.040
And the self-deprecation and the self-annihilation.

49:09.040 --> 49:09.880
That's not self-deprecation.

49:09.880 --> 49:13.000
Yeah, the self-hatred is there.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.120
It's self-hatred, yeah.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.600
Yes, the self-hatred is there and it's present

49:16.600 --> 49:20.280
and it's clouding all his judgments, okay?

49:20.280 --> 49:23.560
And so it's seeping out into his words, his verbiage,

49:23.560 --> 49:24.520
everything.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.240
So be careful not to put too much stake in that

49:27.240 --> 49:29.600
because sometimes we all get down on ourselves

49:29.600 --> 49:32.440
and we hate ourselves and we only see bad shit.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.000
And that colors everything else.

49:34.000 --> 49:34.840
No.

49:34.840 --> 49:36.960
But if you focus on something, if it's not you

49:36.960 --> 49:38.600
and you're looking at someone else's...

49:38.600 --> 49:39.440
But to the extent that...

49:39.440 --> 49:41.840
No, if you're looking at someone else's vomit

49:41.840 --> 49:44.040
of self-hatred and you look through it

49:44.040 --> 49:45.160
and you find these little pieces

49:45.160 --> 49:48.240
that were eaten a long time ago, they're coming out,

49:48.240 --> 49:50.720
you can't focus on that as making a data point.

49:50.720 --> 49:53.680
That's, first of all, a disgusting analogy.

49:53.720 --> 49:55.680
And second of all, I completely,

49:55.680 --> 49:57.320
I think that's very smart what you're saying.

49:57.320 --> 50:00.280
But to the extent that our goal here

50:00.280 --> 50:03.680
is to better understand why your dad killed himself,

50:03.680 --> 50:06.920
looking at his self-hatred and how he expresses

50:06.920 --> 50:09.160
his self-hatred, I think is highly relevant

50:09.160 --> 50:11.480
when it's in the context of all these other data points.

50:11.480 --> 50:12.560
So...

50:12.560 --> 50:14.000
Right, but that's what I'm afraid of

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
is that we're building a false context of data points,

50:19.560 --> 50:22.640
a false house, easily broken, a glass house,

50:22.680 --> 50:24.440
one little window could smash it.

50:24.440 --> 50:27.640
I'm just not thinking Billy Joel's album, Glass House.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.520
Anyway, this...

50:29.520 --> 50:30.360
Sorry, you lost me there.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.200
No, I just...

50:31.200 --> 50:32.040
My mind went on a thing.

50:32.040 --> 50:32.880
Okay, so...

50:32.880 --> 50:34.120
But no, no, no, but do you get what I'm saying?

50:34.120 --> 50:37.120
Just be careful because if you use that,

50:37.120 --> 50:40.080
if you use this self-hatred spewage

50:40.080 --> 50:42.600
for your data point to support your other theory,

50:42.600 --> 50:46.040
I think that it's very wobbly.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.760
I mean, you have, if you're going home

50:47.760 --> 50:49.800
and you have a terrible day at work

50:49.800 --> 50:51.520
and the wife is driving you nuts

50:51.560 --> 50:53.240
and the kids are going crazy

50:53.240 --> 50:55.080
and then your mom calls and your dad calls

50:55.080 --> 50:56.680
and you lost something, you're just like,

50:56.680 --> 50:58.520
oh, and then all of a sudden you take it inward

50:58.520 --> 51:01.760
and you maybe saw my fault, I'm an asshole, I'm an idiot.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.360
And you start writing all this stuff down

51:03.360 --> 51:05.040
about just to get it out of you.

51:05.040 --> 51:05.880
I'm an asshole, I'm an idiot,

51:05.880 --> 51:08.000
I can't believe I did this, it's all my fault.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.400
And then you go to sleep and then a few days later

51:10.400 --> 51:11.960
you wake up and you feel a lot better,

51:11.960 --> 51:14.600
you look back at the thing, you're like, oh my God.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.320
I can't believe I blame myself for all this.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.520
You know, how ridiculous, this obviously is not my fault.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.640
This obviously, my mom's the one that said this,

51:21.640 --> 51:23.080
so that's why I reacted like this.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.720
And you look back and you use your rational brain,

51:25.720 --> 51:27.080
you look through it and you realize

51:27.080 --> 51:30.440
this was you expaling an expulsion

51:30.440 --> 51:33.080
or expounding all these things

51:33.080 --> 51:34.680
that you were inside you at the time.

51:34.680 --> 51:36.240
But you don't go through them and use them

51:36.240 --> 51:40.440
as a data point to build a theory as to anything else.

51:40.440 --> 51:43.400
It's almost irrelevant in that sense.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.360
I disagree.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.400
Almost irrelevant.

51:45.400 --> 51:47.640
The most relevant is the self-hatred

51:47.640 --> 51:50.400
in the bigger picture, but the details of the self-hatred,

51:50.400 --> 51:52.680
I don't think are that relevant.

51:52.680 --> 51:56.320
Except that we know, first of all, they killed himself.

51:56.320 --> 51:59.640
And we know what he said to his psychologist,

51:59.640 --> 52:03.440
and to his doctor, and numerous of his friends,

52:03.440 --> 52:06.840
and his lawyer, and it all says the same thing, Val.

52:06.840 --> 52:07.760
Okay.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.520
You know what I mean, I agree with you

52:09.520 --> 52:11.360
that we shouldn't take these in isolation.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.400
We shouldn't. Yeah, yeah.

52:12.400 --> 52:13.400
But we're not.

52:13.400 --> 52:18.400
I mean, this is a lot of evidence.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.000
Okay.

52:20.000 --> 52:20.840
I hear you.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.240
But it isn't.

52:24.240 --> 52:26.360
Like when he says he betrayed Anshun.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.960
I don't think he didn't literally betray him.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.720
I think he thinks he failed him.

52:29.720 --> 52:31.520
Yeah, but why didn't he just say fail?

52:31.520 --> 52:35.200
Because he was, you know, obviously a very dark place.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.400
And he didn't betray Anshun.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.680
Like the...

52:38.680 --> 52:42.120
But to someone that doesn't know my father,

52:42.160 --> 52:44.520
there's no situation to read this and says betrayed.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.640
Oh, clearly, Bill is hiding something.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.280
Clearly, David's not writing something.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.000
Clearly, Val is holding back something he found in the emails

52:51.000 --> 52:52.520
because there's word betrayal in there.

52:52.520 --> 52:55.200
By the time I paid 281,

52:55.200 --> 52:56.680
Did you get my point?

52:56.680 --> 52:58.000
Yes, I understand.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.120
How strong that word can be missed.

53:01.120 --> 53:03.320
Well, but it's not my word.

53:03.320 --> 53:08.320
I know, but how, to a novice reader of this story,

53:08.760 --> 53:11.280
in this book, to just see that word and have that pop out,

53:11.360 --> 53:12.720
such a loaded word,

53:12.720 --> 53:15.680
that they can easily conspiracy theories arise.

53:15.680 --> 53:17.840
Val and David are leaving out something very important

53:17.840 --> 53:18.680
that Bill's guilty of.

53:18.680 --> 53:20.760
Why would he kill himself?

53:20.760 --> 53:22.320
Clearly, he did something wrong.

53:22.320 --> 53:23.960
Do you know, it's like the fallacy of saying,

53:23.960 --> 53:25.880
well, why is Val's mom treating him like this?

53:25.880 --> 53:27.520
Clearly, Val did something wrong.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.360
You know?

53:28.360 --> 53:32.640
The fallacy of, you know, do you get my point?

53:32.640 --> 53:37.640
Yeah, except that this is page 281 of a book

53:37.680 --> 53:42.680
that has your dad's rise and fall

53:43.040 --> 53:45.640
as one of its central narrative backbones.

53:45.640 --> 53:48.160
And I do not think anyone can be taking anything out of context

53:48.160 --> 53:49.000
to this one in the book.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
I just wanted to let you see what your thoughts are on that.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.920
And express my thoughts.

53:53.920 --> 53:58.400
You know, it's a risk in my head, it's a risk.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.560
Well, but I'm trying to manage.

54:00.560 --> 54:01.400
Yeah, I hear you.

54:01.400 --> 54:03.120
But I mean, to me, like,

54:03.560 --> 54:08.440
I'm not bothered by that risk.

54:08.440 --> 54:13.440
I think the risk is there's no way to ignore what he wrote.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.440
And you put it in a lot of context

54:15.440 --> 54:16.560
and it belongs a lot.

54:16.560 --> 54:19.240
But you could add an opposing viewpoint.

54:19.240 --> 54:20.080
What's the opposing viewpoint?

54:20.080 --> 54:21.920
What I just told you.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.160
No one's suggesting he betrayed him.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.880
There's, I think in his head,

54:25.880 --> 54:28.320
he probably felt like he had failed, though.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.440
That makes more sense.

54:29.440 --> 54:30.960
But he didn't use the word fail.

54:30.960 --> 54:34.280
Well, he used the word carelessness.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.120
Yeah.

54:35.120 --> 54:35.960
And it.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.600
That leads to failure, I guess.

54:38.600 --> 54:39.440
Okay.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.240
So let's see.

54:44.960 --> 54:46.800
Am I going to Europe?

54:46.800 --> 54:47.920
Is that what's next?

54:47.920 --> 54:48.760
So what's next?

54:48.760 --> 54:50.120
Let's go to Europe.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.000
Off you go.

54:51.000 --> 54:51.840
Okay.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.600
So you decided to go to Europe

54:53.600 --> 54:55.440
a little bit after the second anniversary of your death.

54:55.440 --> 54:57.600
Are you going over the post thing?

54:58.520 --> 54:59.360
No.

54:59.360 --> 55:02.400
I'm mentioning, that's a good question, actually.

55:02.400 --> 55:06.680
Let me, we'll get there in two minutes.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.520
Okay.

55:07.520 --> 55:08.960
So you decided to go to Europe

55:10.480 --> 55:12.520
a little bit after the second anniversary of your death.

55:12.520 --> 55:15.320
So that's in early 2016.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.320
It's March, probably.

55:18.320 --> 55:19.160
Yeah.

55:22.080 --> 55:26.240
I'm noting that, and maybe this is wrong, actually,

55:26.240 --> 55:27.240
and I should fix this.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.320
But there is, at least the way it seemed to me

55:29.320 --> 55:32.440
and previous, our infinite conversations

55:32.440 --> 55:33.760
we've had about this.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.080
By this point, it seemed a bit clearer to you

55:38.080 --> 55:40.520
that your dad clearly had committed suicide,

55:40.520 --> 55:45.520
at least in part, because of fear and concern

55:45.720 --> 55:48.840
and shame about what had happened at the back.

55:48.840 --> 55:50.440
No, not yet.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.280
Not yet.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.440
This is a good thing you brought up.

55:53.440 --> 55:56.360
Because at this point, that's why I said,

55:56.360 --> 55:57.280
I'm going to go over the post part,

55:57.280 --> 56:00.600
because this is when Michael Gray comes in

56:00.600 --> 56:04.400
and plants it in my head that my dad was murdered.

56:04.400 --> 56:06.000
He puts this into my head,

56:06.000 --> 56:07.920
which I already kind of thought,

56:07.920 --> 56:10.200
he was toying with this idea that he was forced

56:10.200 --> 56:13.120
to kill himself or suicide by extortion.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.760
Like, if you don't kill yourself, we're gonna,

56:15.760 --> 56:17.240
the Hollywood version.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.520
In fact, the next paragraph here,

56:18.520 --> 56:19.800
we got into Michael Gray, so.

56:19.800 --> 56:23.200
Yeah, and when that seed was planted in my head,

56:23.200 --> 56:26.600
I went to, I wanted to meet David Rossi,

56:26.600 --> 56:28.840
when I learned the whole David Rossi story.

56:28.840 --> 56:30.240
But did you think at that point,

56:30.240 --> 56:32.680
that in a literally like way?

56:32.680 --> 56:34.360
I didn't want to believe that my dad killed himself.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.360
I did not want to believe that at all.

56:37.720 --> 56:39.560
And that's, tell me why.

56:39.560 --> 56:44.360
I just, it just didn't fit in my understanding of my father.

56:44.360 --> 56:46.720
It just didn't fit in anyone's understanding of him.

56:46.720 --> 56:47.560
As you can guess.

56:47.560 --> 56:48.740
Yeah, that's definitely true.

56:48.740 --> 56:51.320
So there's, in congruency there,

56:51.360 --> 56:53.280
I wanted to figure out what was wrong.

56:53.280 --> 56:57.280
And what was, maybe I have to examine all possibilities.

56:57.280 --> 57:00.560
And one of those possibilities is that it was

57:00.560 --> 57:04.000
some sort of shady mafia shit with Monty Duposky.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.080
And that's what Michael Gray planted in my head.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.080
And I ran with it.

57:07.080 --> 57:09.600
And I really took it to the end of its,

57:09.600 --> 57:12.160
I took it as far as I could go until I realized

57:12.160 --> 57:14.320
that that was ridiculous.

57:14.320 --> 57:15.760
But I had to examine it.

57:15.760 --> 57:16.600
No, I understand.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.000
And this is actually, in fact,

57:18.000 --> 57:19.680
basically the way I've written it.

57:19.720 --> 57:21.520
There's no indication of foul playing Bill's death,

57:21.520 --> 57:23.560
but after watching the Italian video,

57:23.560 --> 57:24.520
you couldn't help but wonder

57:24.520 --> 57:26.680
whether I'm going to uncover, et cetera, et cetera.

57:26.680 --> 57:30.160
So one thing I need to run by here or tell you

57:30.160 --> 57:33.360
is that I've got a footnote here.

57:33.360 --> 57:34.640
There aren't many footnotes in this book,

57:34.640 --> 57:36.360
but there's one right here.

57:36.360 --> 57:40.240
Which I say, exercising awful judgment,

57:40.240 --> 57:42.160
you shared with Michael Gray,

57:42.160 --> 57:44.000
one of the photos you've shown,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.320
or you've taken of your dad lying in the hallway.

57:46.320 --> 57:49.200
And I say that exhibiting even worse taste,

57:49.200 --> 57:51.400
the post then published that photo.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.720
And I'm saying that your family-

57:52.720 --> 57:55.400
I was saying the emails where I was upset about that.

57:55.400 --> 57:56.240
And I'm saying-

57:56.240 --> 57:57.600
The emails I said to Michael Gray,

57:57.600 --> 57:59.480
like, why did you do this to take it out?

57:59.480 --> 58:00.560
And they said it was too late

58:00.560 --> 58:01.400
because it's already-

58:01.400 --> 58:02.640
Well, they did edit it, ultimately.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.480
But there-

58:03.480 --> 58:04.320
They did.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.160
Ultimately, yeah, it's not like that.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.320
I haven't even looked.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.160
Yeah, it's gone.

58:07.160 --> 58:08.000
I mean-

58:08.000 --> 58:08.840
That's great.

58:08.840 --> 58:11.000
But in his, I mean, there is not much defense room.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.560
Like, you should not have published those photos,

58:12.560 --> 58:13.400
I don't think.

58:13.400 --> 58:16.440
But on the other hand, yeah, you like did,

58:16.440 --> 58:18.080
he's a journalist and you gave it to him, so.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.680
You should have asked me.

58:19.680 --> 58:21.440
Well, whatever, it doesn't matter.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.280
There is-

58:22.280 --> 58:23.120
No, it doesn't matter.

58:23.120 --> 58:24.520
I said, can I use this photo in the production?

58:24.520 --> 58:27.440
I said, yes or no, you know, you should have asked me.

58:29.160 --> 58:31.480
I'm noting that your family suspected

58:31.480 --> 58:33.400
you had sold the photo to the post,

58:33.400 --> 58:34.960
which was not the case,

58:34.960 --> 58:36.360
and they never forgave you for that.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.960
No, for something, never forgave you

58:38.960 --> 58:40.680
for something that never happened.

58:40.680 --> 58:42.240
Well, you did share it with the post.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.080
Yes, I did share it.

58:43.080 --> 58:46.200
Which was not in my, I don't think,

58:46.200 --> 58:47.600
you've not, this is a stupid move.

58:47.600 --> 58:48.440
It was stupid, yeah.

58:48.440 --> 58:49.280
Yeah, shit, yeah.

58:49.280 --> 58:50.200
Just wanted to know what it would be,

58:50.200 --> 58:51.040
what we want to be at the scene,

58:51.040 --> 58:51.880
what it would look like.

58:51.880 --> 58:52.920
And then I thought, you know,

58:52.920 --> 58:54.720
they could have gotten it from the police anyway,

58:54.720 --> 58:56.240
it's like handed everything over to them,

58:56.240 --> 58:58.880
so why not save them some fucking time?

59:00.480 --> 59:03.840
It's not like they couldn't get it in my head,

59:03.840 --> 59:05.600
so I thought, I don't know.

59:05.600 --> 59:06.440
Okay.

59:06.440 --> 59:07.960
It was, yes, but yes, it was a terrible move,

59:07.960 --> 59:10.000
and it's fine to put that in there.

59:10.000 --> 59:10.840
Okay.

59:13.320 --> 59:16.160
Okay, so you, maybe you've already done this,

59:16.160 --> 59:18.320
but you go into your mom's email,

59:18.320 --> 59:20.960
you find the details for AMX.

59:20.960 --> 59:21.800
And...

59:21.800 --> 59:24.440
I think also, if I could just go back for a minute,

59:24.440 --> 59:25.800
instead of just a footnote saying

59:25.800 --> 59:28.000
it was a ridiculously terrible move,

59:28.000 --> 59:31.960
can you explain that it became a huge

59:31.960 --> 59:34.320
incident between the family?

59:34.320 --> 59:35.160
Yeah, no, I say that.

59:35.160 --> 59:37.880
I say, Val family suspected that he had sold

59:37.880 --> 59:40.240
the photo to the post, which was not the case,

59:40.240 --> 59:41.680
and they never forgave him.

59:41.680 --> 59:44.640
Okay, I mean, you think it's only worth a footnote?

59:44.640 --> 59:45.720
Yeah, I do.

59:46.160 --> 59:47.000
Um...

59:52.080 --> 59:54.760
Okay, so you get your mom's AMX number,

59:54.760 --> 59:56.840
you buy a bunch of new computer equipment

59:56.840 --> 59:57.880
for the trip to Europe,

59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.360
you load all this stuff onto one of the new laptops,

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.840
you get a business class ticket to Paris,

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.440
and you fly in March of 2016.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.360
You land at Charles de Gaulle,

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.920
and things immediately go off course.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.360
You're in the bathroom,

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.480
briefly to snort a few lines of coke,

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.600
and you leave your bags unattended.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.440
Yeah.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.880
And when you come out,

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.280
a bunch of the new computer stuff is gone.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.000
The laptop with all the stuff on it.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.440
I'd go, and it was snorting heroin, not coke, but...

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.280
That's good.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.120
Let me...

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:31.960
That somehow fits right now.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.160
Yeah, and I was doing that on the flight, too.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.520
And I had gone to the bathroom,

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.480
yes, but I did not leave my bags unattended.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.520
I had them all in that silly little push cart

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.560
they have brought into the bathroom with me.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.120
I specifically chose one of those big disabled bathrooms,

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.640
so I could put it all in there.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.080
Took it all back out, everything was in my line of sight,

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.760
and I go to buy a SIM card,

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.280
and it's the only time I could not take it

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.520
into the kiosk area.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.480
I had to leave it next to the cashier.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.320
Got it, okay.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.680
That's when I would have lost my line of sight

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.880
for just a few minutes.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.960
Yeah, okay.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.720
So computer equipment gets stolen,

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.560
except for the laptop with all the stuff

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.800
you'd got taken from your dad's files.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.960
There were two iParents,

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.760
and two possibly,

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.120
whatever it was in the police car, I can't remember,

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.160
it was two hard drives, the big G drives,

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.360
like those two terabytes worth.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.160
Two of those are gone, and the iPads are missing.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.000
Yeah, okay.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.800
And the backpacks I had on my,

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.520
I was wearing them so they couldn't have taken those.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.360
Okay.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.680
Nothing else was taken, no passport,

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.000
everything else was, nothing else was stolen,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.600
but those specific drives.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.440
Okay, you called Larry Meltzer from the airport,

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.280
told him what had happened.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.960
I called him at the hotel, but not at the airport.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960
You sure about that?

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.200
I'm pretty sure you called him from the airport.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.400
Did I call him from the airport?

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.240
I may have.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.280
If he says I did, I probably didn't.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.880
Okay, so he told you.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.240
I called him many times, I just can't remember.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.240
Yeah, he told you that it was possible

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.880
that you were being followed,

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.040
perhaps at least I'm from Deutsche,

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.280
and he just warned you to be careful.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.120
Yeah.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.760
So you then rent an Audi from Avis?

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.320
No, Nissan Cascua, Cascai.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.240
Really?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:25.920
What did he?

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.760
It's a bit later.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.440
I spent about three weeks detoxing off the heroin.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.120
Unfortunately, in France, there's a lot of coding

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.000
over the counter, so that was very helpful.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.440
But when you drive to Amsterdam,

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.440
you drive an Audi from Avis?

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.720
No, no, no, no.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.880
When I drive to Amsterdam, I drive a Nissan Cascai.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.720
You sure?

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.360
That's what, in Amsterdam, your car gets smashed.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.760
Yeah, that's the Cascai, the Cascai.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.280
Are you 100% certain about that?

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.800
Because you showed me a photo of this.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800
Yeah, I'm 100% certain.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.920
I'm saying this, but it looks like an Audi, but it's not.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.200
Okay, so what is it?

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.400
It's a Nissan QUA.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.240
I don't care.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.080
I'll just say Nissan.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:01.920
QUAI.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.120
Okay, Nissan.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.320
I'll share the photos.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.960
Okay, so one evening, someone smashes the car's window,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.480
steals the remaining laptop,

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.640
which was hidden under the passenger seat,

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.760
and yet your wallet, password, guitar,

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.760
which were all in plain view weren't stolen.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.600
This is in Amsterdam.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.440
Yes.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.280
Yeah.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.600
And that's it for you.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.000
You concluded at this point, and as does Larry Meltzer,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.480
that there's a conspiracy afoot.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.480
A conspiracy afoot.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.840
And, you know, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.800
And Meltzer is further convinced of this

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.960
because he, at one time when you're talking,

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.200
hears some odd clicking sounds on the line,

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.440
and another time you call him,

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.560
but end up getting connected to his wife's cell phone.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.400
Very weird.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.240
Yeah.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.640
And then not only that, I mean,

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.120
computers would turn off restart on their own.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.040
The phones would turn off restart on their own.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.200
Very strange things happen.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.120
Very odd buggy behavior.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.320
We're both convinced.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.680
Well, he convinced me that I was being hacked.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.760
I didn't want to believe it, because I had,

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.280
remember, I had just been through this terrible experience

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.120
of paranoia and delusion.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.040
I did not want to ever go back there again.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.400
So any hint of you're being followed was like,

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.800
I don't want to believe this.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.040
I'm not being followed.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.400
I'm perfectly normal.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.880
Everything's normal, you know?

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.600
And Larry had to keep beating it into me

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.640
that be careful, be careful, be careful.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.480
Yeah.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.120
I mean, some people might argue that that is not

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.640
the most constructive rule for a therapist,

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.720
I know, I know, I know.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.280
It's funny that the therapist is telling me

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.520
to be more paranoid.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.880
Yes, funny is the word for it.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.440
It's ironic, ironic.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.880
Okay, so you check into a suite in the Steigenberger,

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.800
Airbird of Tallinn, Amsterdam.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.080
Wait, but what about the whole time in the Camping

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:54.920
of Ligambos?

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.760
That was a whole...

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.440
No, that's afterwards.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.360
No, no, no, no, no.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.480
I check into, I can see it in my head.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.760
This is the campground you're talking about?

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.200
Yes, before the campground, I check into

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.280
the Hotel New Hampshire, New Hampshire Hotels

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.880
right in Rembrandt Square.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.880
Tell them the name of it if I can find it for you.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.880
And I stay there for about 12-ish days

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.000
before I'm going to go to Siena.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.800
And we also passed up to me trying to get back

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.320
into the country, back into England.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320
Yeah, I don't care about that.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.160
Okay.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240
Now, are you sure about this

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.480
because I've looked at the receipts

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.880
from the airport hotel.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.040
Yeah, no, I definitely stayed there,

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.040
but that was after the Camping of Ligambos.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.640
It was a Hampshire hotel in Rembrandt Square.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.840
I'm going to call it Hotel New Hampshire,

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.960
but it's not, that's a book by John Irving.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.720
It was something, something, and it had a nice suite.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.320
Don't worry about, what are you doing right now, by the way?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.560
I'm trying to find the photo of the car,

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.200
of the Nissan Cache Quarry.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.920
And I'll show you the picture of the hotel as well,

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.000
the actual name of the hotel in Amsterdam.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.560
Okay, so you stay at another hotel in Amsterdam.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.400
Yes.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.640
Then, using your mom's AmEx,

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.640
and then you, she or her guy figures out

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.360
that there's theft going on.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.520
Not yet.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.000
Why do you end up at the campground then?

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.440
So I'm at the campground.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.280
No, no, no, no.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.160
You're in a hotel.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.000
Yeah.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.520
Why do you go from a hotel to a campground?

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.320
So I met this lady in a bar in Amsterdam,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.680
and she said, you got to come to this place

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.800
called Fliegenboos, where there's like a hippie dream.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.480
You know, everyone's jamming all the time,

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.480
and people from all over the world are here,

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.400
and it's just like the coolest place in Amsterdam.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.320
And come on Saturday night, especially,

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.760
you know, I want you to come play with us.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.840
You brought your guitars, you know,

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.520
come jam and play a show here.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.160
And I'm like, okay, fine, why not?

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.760
You know, I haven't played music in a while.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.840
It'll be good to meet some, some cool people in Amsterdam,

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.440
and go.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.120
So I drive down there,

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.880
and it turns out it was not the hippie dream she mentioned.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.520
She just was running this music show,

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.040
this music night at the place,

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.800
and just wanted me to play for free.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.640
So I was like, okay, fine.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.240
So when I played, I rented a cabin,

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.600
and I stayed there for two nights,

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.200
and the night before I was going to leave,

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.400
I think it was a Sunday,

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.360
I go into Amsterdam, into Thalstra,

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.400
to go buy some cigarettes in the center of Amsterdam.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.760
I leave the car in a cobblestone fucking street

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.760
to go buy cigarettes.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.320
I've gone for five fucking minutes.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.880
I get back into the car,

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.480
I get back toward the car, I see the strewn glass,

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.640
and I'm like, oh shit,

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.000
somebody's car just got broken into,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.800
I feel terrible over it.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.120
This happened too.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.560
I get closer to my car, and underneath the fucking lamp,

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.360
you know, there's just windows gone smashed.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.360
I'm like, fuck it's me, you know?

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.640
I go in, I check to see what's missing.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.040
Only thing that's missing is the black laptop.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.720
Just exactly like this, I use this exact same cover.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.360
In the darkness of night,

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.960
under cover of the fucking night,

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.200
in Amsterdam, under one streetlight,

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.760
underneath the passenger side seat,

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.720
you had to know where it was.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.640
My passport, right here, right here,

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.760
nothing else was taken.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.360
Guitars, in the back, my strat, in the back,

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.640
all my luggage, in the back.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.480
I'm just starting to lose it.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.120
Can we just focus on the chronology for a second though?

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.840
There's, okay, so you're at this New Hampshire hotel,

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.960
whatever it's called.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.680
You then go and spend a couple nights at the campground,

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.200
then your car that's broken into,

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.760
and they steal the laptop, and then what?

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.520
And then, I file a police report,

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.520
I go to the Amsterdam police,

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.120
we call Avis, tell them what happened.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.520
They said they're gonna send a tow truck the next day

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.200
and swap out cars for me, you know,

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.720
don't worry about it, et cetera, et cetera.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.560
You might have to pay a little bit for the window,

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.240
whatever you're based on your insurance.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.480
I'm like, great, I got full insurance, you know?

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.920
At least I thought I did, I turned out I didn't.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.120
I go back to the campground, I sleep, I wake up,

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.320
I go to check out with my card,

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.360
and the, I can't remember his name anymore,

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.640
but the guy's like, your card's not working,

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.480
I was like, what do you mean it's not working,

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.840
it's not working, so your card's not working.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.720
So I call the bank, and I look at the app,

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.360
sorry, I didn't call the bank, I look at the app,

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.040
and I'm negative $15,000.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:17.880
It's like, what the fuck?

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:22.200
And it's from Avis, I fetch Avis, and so then I'm stuck.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.920
And so then you just stay at the campground

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.120
for a while, and I just stay at the campground.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.560
Okay.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.920
There were, yes, the reason I couldn't get out,

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.080
because I could not.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.280
Wait, so then were you using your mom's credit card,

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.360
or was that another credit card?

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.000
I was using, no, for the,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Vleganbos was not very expensive,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.640
so I could use my card for that.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.120
But what about for Avis?

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.680
For Avis, I used my mom's card,

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.120
but I paid with my, I used my mom's card as the,

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.240
because you can't do it with a debit card in that country,

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.520
but I can use the credit card number

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.680
and put it on my card,

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.720
because it could not charge remotely only on digits.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.000
I had to show up with an actual thing,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.560
but on the reservation online, you can use just digits,

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.440
but you have to show up with a proper car

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.280
that they can take money from in person.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.320
So they couldn't take money off my mom's card,

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.720
they can only take it off my card.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.880
So I used it to establish that there is credit,

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.920
and that if anything happens,

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.160
you can go to this credit card company.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.560
That's the way they did it in fucking Avis Charles DeGaulle.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.440
Do you understand what I mean?

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.320
Yes.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.800
What I'm confused about a little bit is-

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.120
And I had to use my money,

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.400
otherwise I would have got a much better card.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.360
At the Hampshire Hotel,

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.360
you are staying on for 12 nights on your mom's card.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.760
Yes.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.600
Okay.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:41.000
So why once your bank account gets drained by Avis,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.400
why don't you just go somewhere else

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.600
and put it on your mom's card?

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.440
Because that, yeah, that card, I couldn't use it.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.520
I couldn't use that anymore.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.640
Because your mom had figured it out.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.040
She had canceled that card, yeah.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.080
That specific card, and I hadn't gone back

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.400
to the emails to find other cards.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.600
Right, and she had figured out, okay.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.440
And I did try.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.640
So what I've gotten wrong here is not,

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.240
it's really just that I got wrong in the name of the hotel.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.080
Right.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.880
So, okay.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.360
And the Audi.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.200
Yeah, and the Audi.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.040
Yeah, and the Audi.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.280
Believe me, if I could have used my mom's card,

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.560
I would have gotten a much nicer car.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.600
Okay, I'm quoting you saying

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.800
that you didn't feel guilty stealing from her.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.720
Not at all.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.000
And I'm quoting you saying,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.440
this is the only way I can get at her.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.760
This is the only jab I can take at her.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.160
Yeah, but that's just, you know, that's silly.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.600
I mean, again, like I told you outside,

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.680
I have no home.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.040
I'm living in rental cars in hotels.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.400
And so I really have no sympathy for her

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.680
to take her money, to stay alive and eat.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.240
Good.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.280
No sympathy, to have shelter and eat.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.200
And yes, you know, I didn't get the basics.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.840
I didn't go to a shitty fucking roadway in.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.160
I went to the best hotels I could.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.000
So fuck her out.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.520
Just, it'd be nice to have some little bit of luxury

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.680
for that I missed for a very long time.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.040
You know, why not?

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.200
And it wasn't a fuck you.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.520
It wasn't like, oh, I'm gonna,

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520
this is my fuck you to her.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.440
This is me staying alive and surviving

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.280
and get through this trip.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.720
So I can get to fucking Sienna

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.720
and find out what's going on with David Rossi.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.560
Okay.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.680
And get to UBS and find and meet Sergio Armani.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.760
That was the other part of the thing.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.640
But that happened later.

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.120
Yes, indeed.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.920
Okay, so at the campground, you mean?

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.000
I would take out, this is my only way of getting back.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.400
Maybe yes, that's part of it.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.240
There was some anger there,

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.360
but that wasn't the basic need.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.040
The basic need was to eat and have shelter.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:24.880
I hear you.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.480
But you're not clicky clacky, you know.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.240
Because we're recording this.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.920
There's, and also I'm not guaranteeing

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.760
I'm taking stuff out.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.040
So there's, but I definitely hear what you're saying.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.600
And I will, I'm gonna, lucky me,

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.840
I'm gonna get to spend, you know,

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.000
how many, we're probably about seven hours now total.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.640
I'm gonna get to go through this all again.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.200
Relive this minus the cigarette smoke.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.200
So minus like the fucking lung cancer you're giving me.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.640
I got the fan blowing and went into the door's open.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.480
Disgusting.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.240
Okay, so.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.040
David, prove what, David.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:03.880
Yeah, exactly.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.040
He sound like my wife.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.120
It's a best piece.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.960
Jesus, David.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960
The Marie keeps telling me,

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.440
it's like, David's like your ex-wife.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.280
He's like a wife.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.280
My ex-wife?

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.680
No, David's like your wife.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.520
Sorry.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.160
Did you talk to David again today?

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.000
Who are you talking to?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:20.820
Is it David?

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.360
Kirsten gets sometimes,

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.400
is both with you and with Tom Hayes.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.520
She like thinks, or has thought that,

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.720
I don't think she's actually thought this,

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.920
but I think it's like occurred to her at points

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.400
that maybe I have a lover.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.280
Is this valve really a man?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.120
Is it male valve?

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.960
Yeah, I don't.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.480
That's why she called,

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.520
or she was on the phone the other night.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.640
No, I think she just like finds you fascinating actually.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.440
And she read the story, right?

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.280
What story?

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.120
She read your book.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.640
Yeah, she's read it, but also she's just like,

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.520
you know, lived this with me for the past,

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.800
what, five years, so.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.360
She is.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.200
I mean, it's more so.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.040
Do I anything?

01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.880
No, not at all.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.720
Yeah, I'll get some water.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.520
I'll pause this for a second, please.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.360
Bring it up.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.200
I think it's important.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.040
Oh, shit, dude.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.880
That's not an exposure.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.240
Oh my God, it's stop recording.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.080
What?

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.840
Okay.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.560
No, like for a while, yeah.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.600
I just wanted to reiterate,

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.560
I just think it's a,

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.600
oh, you didn't record that last minute.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.760
Oh, yeah, I can understand you.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.600
No, I don't think it's.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.600
No, that's not gonna happen.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.600
You don't see this thing.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.880
All you have to do is to spend some time

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.240
and you should look at it as opposed to

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.080
what's not to be seen as many after you.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.220
You have to do that.

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.740
You should have.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.040
You should have, that's funny.
