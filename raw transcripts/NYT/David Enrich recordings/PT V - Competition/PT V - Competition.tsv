0	3000	Okay, can you hear me? David?
3000	5000	It's your station name?
5000	6000	Hello.
6000	7000	I think we're all good.
7000	8000	A little louder?
8000	9000	I don't want it louder.
9000	10000	Okay.
10000	13000	Uh, January 26th, 2019.
13000	14000	That is today.
14000	16000	Five years since your death, Seth.
16000	17000	Yeah.
17000	18000	How are you feeling?
18000	19000	Uh, shitty.
19000	21000	It's a terrible day, of course.
21000	23000	So...
23000	25000	How about you?
25000	27000	What is it that you ever experienced?
27000	28000	I don't know.
28000	30000	I don't know what's been on your brain.
30000	31000	Five years.
31000	33000	Do you, like, think about the five years?
33000	36000	Like, these annual anniversaries are the most important days to you?
36000	37000	Of course.
37000	39000	Of course, I dread them.
39000	41000	I don't like this day.
41000	43000	It's a terrible day.
43000	46000	It's not only because my dad's death,
46000	48000	and I have to think about it all over again,
48000	51000	because I know there's no one I can call or talk to.
51000	54000	My sisters and my family are all doing something.
54000	57000	And they are, uh, you know, I'm excluded from all that.
57000	65000	So I usually just go out and try and take my mind off of it various ways.
65000	67000	Like, tonight we have a party scheduled.
67000	68000	So...
68000	69000	Yes.
69000	71000	I remember on the first anniversary,
71000	73000	uh, Andrew did something nice.
73000	77000	He didn't know that his screening for the Jinx was on the 26th.
77000	80000	I mean, he didn't know the significance of the 26th,
80000	81000	so he invited me to his screening.
81000	83000	And I was during the Sony hack,
83000	86000	and that was why I flew from San Francisco to LA to do that.
86000	88000	Just take my mind off of it.
88000	94000	The next year, 2015, was pretty miserable.
94000	97000	Um, I spent that at this...
97000	99000	Uh, sorry, 2016 was pretty shitty,
99000	104000	because I spent that in some hotel room in New York.
104000	106000	Pretty high.
106000	111000	Um, 2017, that was when I met Glenn on that day.
111000	123000	And then in 2018, I was, I think, a hibernation point for most of January last year.
123000	125000	And then here we are today.
125000	131000	But around that same time is when we contact each other again to do this project.
131000	134000	So that was something that always kind of happens around then.
134000	136000	Um, you were around.
136000	137000	You came out...
137000	140000	I came out, I think it was like a week or two later last year.
140000	141000	What was it?
141000	143000	I think it was early February, yeah.
143000	145000	Yeah, I don't think, I think it was late January.
145000	146000	But we'll...
146000	148000	Maybe, it definitely wasn't the 26th,
148000	149000	because I think I would have remembered that.
149000	154000	But I think it was around the 26th when you called and said something about the book.
154000	156000	No, that was a bit later.
156000	157000	Um...
157000	158000	Okay.
158000	159000	Anyway...
159000	160000	Yeah, it's just miserable time.
160000	161000	I mean, what do you want?
161000	162000	I'm just...
162000	164000	Yeah, no, you mentioned it all.
164000	169000	It's a reminder, I haven't solved the mystery as well.
169000	173000	I haven't figured out what happened.
173000	174000	Um...
174000	178000	Well, thank you for spending the day with me.
178000	185000	Thank you for flying out here to, to force it into me that this is definitely the day
185000	191000	my dad killed himself and wanted to be here and get this on camera for whatever you have
191000	192000	planned for this.
192000	194000	It's very, very kind of you.
194000	196000	I want to come out to see you.
196000	197000	How about January 26th, pal?
197000	199000	What do you think about that day?
199000	202000	I mean, it's kind of fun.
202000	204000	But it's not, but it's fun.
204000	205000	Yeah, I like your smirk.
205000	206000	Don't worry.
206000	207000	Don't forget about the camera, dude.
207000	208000	I'm just...
208000	209000	You and I here.
209000	210000	We're here, buddy.
210000	212000	Let's try and pretend that there's no camera.
212000	217000	Although it's impossible to do so at some level.
217000	219000	But if we don't like this, we can delete it.
219000	220000	Let me try again.
220000	221000	Yeah.
221000	222000	Yeah, for sure, man.
222000	223000	There's...
223000	224000	Let me go get the computer.
224000	225000	Okay.
226000	229000	Do you want any more coffee?
229000	230000	No.
230000	231000	Okay.
231000	232000	No?
232000	239000	Let me find out when you came last time.
239000	242000	I'm pretty sure it was in January.
242000	251000	It was in January.
251000	254000	Dude, I'm Rick 2017.
254000	255000	Enrich.
255000	256000	Enrich, sorry, 2018.
256000	258000	I call you by your German proper pronunciation.
258000	263000	I still say Mueller instead of Muller as well.
263000	268000	January 18th, you came out...
284000	299000	February 1st.
299000	311000	Okay.
311000	312000	Okay.
312000	316000	Yeah, you came out actually around after my birthday.
316000	322000	Between the 26th and the 14th.
322000	324000	I sent you this on the 25th.
324000	325000	The thugs.
325000	326000	Why am I...
326000	329000	Why is this doing this?
329000	330000	And yes.
330000	333000	And then I sent you my dad's note to me on the 25th of last year.
333000	335000	So that was after you came.
335000	336000	I don't think so.
336000	338000	Do you remember this?
338000	340000	For some reason, my...
340000	345000	Just doing this weird thing with the emails where they're stacking them up, cancel.
345000	349000	Yeah, on the 25th of January, I sent you my dad's note to me.
349000	351000	Yeah, but I think that was before I came out here.
351000	352000	Sure.
352000	353000	No, I'm not sure.
353000	354000	It doesn't really matter.
354000	355000	Okay.
355000	359000	Well, just for my sense of memory.
359000	364000	All right, should we get going there?
364000	365000	Sorry?
365000	366000	Yeah.
366000	372000	Okay, so picking up basically where we left off.
372000	375000	Which was, what was the last thing we did?
375000	376000	Yesterday.
376000	382000	So you were in Maine at Sydney's Place and you recorded music.
382000	383000	You recorded.
383000	385000	Yeah, Sydney's got this great place, like a lair.
385000	386000	It's not even an apartment.
386000	391000	It's like this beautiful penthouse with the stairs going up to the...
391000	393000	It's like an evil James Bond villain lair.
393000	394000	It's incredible.
394000	397000	And the great sound, great acoustics in there.
397000	402000	But yeah, and Sydney was a sort of sweetheart, but she really was very, very kind.
402000	405000	So she let me stay there and she wasn't there.
405000	410000	Okay, so at this point you've gotten into your mom's emails.
410000	411000	Yeah.
411000	415000	And you've started, like, piecing stuff together.
415000	416000	Yeah.
416000	423000	And it, so one of the things you find in there are all these email chains involving the
423000	424000	coroner's inquest.
424000	425000	Right.
425000	426000	And your dad's death.
426000	428000	And this is pretty important.
428000	433000	I'm not sure if you recognize how important it was at the time, but it's...
433000	434000	Yeah.
434000	436000	So we find a few things.
436000	448000	One is that we can see in there all of the, like, what the first doctor prescribed.
448000	450000	And we can also see...
450000	452000	Is it the way they're in?
452000	453000	I don't know.
453000	455000	There's sleeping pills or Xanax.
455000	456000	Right.
456000	457000	There's...
457000	461000	And he also refers him to the psychologist, Dr. Mitchell.
461000	471000	And so the coroner said, or the coroner asks both the, like, the physician and the psychologist
471000	474000	what lay about his state of mind.
474000	478000	And so we've got that he explained.
478000	481000	He was being investigated by the U.S. and the European courts.
481000	483000	He was extremely anxious.
483000	484000	We've got...
484000	485000	So that's from Moore.
485000	490000	But it's really Mitchell that is, in a lot of ways, more interesting.
490000	500000	So it recounts how, what he had talked about when he visited and mentioned his career,
500000	506000	his problems, his anxieties, his love for his two daughters.
506000	512000	And that, quote, he was suffering from high levels of anxiety related to investigations
512000	515000	into the LIBOR allegations by the U.S. and the U authorities.
515000	519000	He was catastrophizing, imagining worst case outcomes, including prosecution,
519000	521000	loss of his wealth, and reputation.
521000	522000	Allen Cloats.
522000	527000	So that, yeah, he still wants Allen Cloats at his party.
527000	530000	Oh, yeah, no, but he still wants Allen Cloats at his party.
530000	531000	Oh, despite LIBOR?
531000	532000	Despite LIBOR.
532000	535000	Yeah, okay, let's, yeah.
535000	539000	So he's catastrophizing, imagining worst case outcomes, including prosecution,
539000	542000	loss of his wealth, and reputation, he's sleeping badly.
542000	544000	And again, this is still quoted from the letter.
544000	546000	He's constantly preoccupied by those concerns.
546000	552000	His self-esteem and normal resilience have been greatly undermined as being named a person of interest
552000	554000	in the LIBOR case and in the EU investigation.
554000	555000	Okay.
555000	560000	And then as he leaves Mitchell, Dr. Mitchell gives him his cell phone and asks him to call
560000	564000	and office, then calls, bills, several times that fall, try to submit an appointment,
564000	566000	and he never calls back.
566000	567000	So, okay.
567000	568000	There's a couple ways to look at it.
568000	572000	If you look at it, face value, it can mean exactly that, right?
572000	575000	Now, if you know my father, he wasn't one for psychiatrists.
575000	576000	He didn't go see psychiatrists.
576000	577000	It wasn't his thing.
577000	579000	He didn't go to therapy.
579000	581000	He was not a therapy type person.
581000	582000	Yep.
582000	583000	Very rarely he would go.
583000	585000	And if he did, it was for a purpose.
585000	591000	And that would be, in my own humble opinion, is to get Xanax, to get drugs.
591000	593000	Because he probably has some anxiety.
593000	595000	This is a psychologist, not a psychiatrist.
595000	596000	Yes.
596000	599000	This isn't the one the physician prescribed the drugs.
599000	601000	This is not someone who would prescribe drugs.
601000	602000	This is not a prescriber.
602000	603000	This is a psychologist.
603000	605000	So Mitchell is not the prescriber.
605000	606000	Moore is the prescriber.
606000	607000	Yeah.
607000	611000	Mitchell is a psychologist, so not someone who would prescribe anything.
611000	612000	Okay.
612000	615000	Well, then maybe take it at face value.
615000	619000	I just don't understand why he would go and see this guy once or twice.
619000	620000	I mean, without.
620000	624000	But sometimes you need to see a psychiatrist to get to the prescriber.
624000	625000	Right.
625000	626000	But this isn't a psychiatrist.
626000	627000	So I'm sorry.
627000	629000	Sometimes you need to see a therapist to get to the physician.
629000	630000	No.
630000	632000	So Moore prescribes, Moore is the physician.
632000	633000	Sure.
633000	634000	And prescribes a bunch of stuff.
634000	635000	Okay.
635000	638000	And then refers him to a psychologist to kind of talk through his problems.
638000	639000	Okay.
639000	641000	And, which he does.
641000	642000	Once.
642000	643000	Yeah.
643000	644000	Once.
644000	645000	Once.
645000	646000	Yeah.
646000	647000	That's it.
647000	648000	Yeah.
648000	649000	So he goes to the doctor, gets the medications, the doctor says,
649000	651000	give you the medications on contingency that you go to the physician.
651000	654000	No, we have no reason to think it was a contingency.
654000	656000	I don't understand what the issue is here.
656000	657000	Are you, you feel like.
657000	662000	I don't see my dad going into a therapist once and laying all this upon this guy for.
662000	663000	You think he just made it up?
663000	665000	No, I don't think he made it up.
665000	669000	I think he uses a tool for something else, which I suspect was to get sanics, but you're
669000	670000	telling me this is not the prescriber.
670000	674000	So perhaps the doctor said on contingency of seeing the therapist, I will give you these
674000	675000	drugs.
675000	676000	If you talk to someone else.
676000	680000	Why is it so hard to believe that maybe he just wanted someone to talk to him?
680000	685000	Because he would have gone back or he would have continued this relationship.
685000	687000	I mean, he has, I could see him.
687000	691000	There's like, I don't, I don't negate that position that you're taking him.
691000	692000	Yes.
692000	697000	Of course, it's good to have someone to talk to and the rest of the families are all
697000	699000	psychiatrist anyway, but he never did.
699000	703000	But why go in for one day just to say this shit and then not come back?
703000	704000	I don't know.
704000	707000	If he found it there, maybe he just didn't find a therapy at all.
707000	711000	Maybe he tried and thought it was ridiculous or maybe he heard himself say this stuff out
711000	713000	loud and thought, oh my God, I am catastrophizing.
713000	714000	This is ridiculous.
714000	720000	Well, except that we know that a few months later he kills himself.
720000	726000	So it's not, I think we can probably stipulate that your dad was like really hurt inside.
726000	729000	And I mean, I don't take any original discount.
729000	730000	No, I don't.
730000	731000	Like he said, he's a psychologist.
731000	732000	I don't want to discount it.
732000	736000	I just don't think it's a smoking gun.
736000	737000	Um, okay.
737000	739000	Well, do you know what I mean?
739000	742000	Yeah, I definitely know what you mean.
742000	745000	I mean, I don't know about a smoking gun, but it's like.
745000	750000	If you've been treating this therapist for a year and this is the therapist, the summation
750000	754000	of his condition, then yes, okay, that could be more of a smoking gun.
754000	757000	But if he goes in one time and says this shit.
757000	758000	I don't know, man.
758000	759000	This isn't a diagnosis.
759000	763000	Come down with another guy for sanics at the same time and get some drugs.
763000	764000	I mean, who knows?
764000	768000	Yeah, but this isn't, he's not like diagnosing your dad and saying your dad was depressed
768000	770000	or your dad was, had an anxiety disorder.
770000	771000	He's saying that your dad.
771000	772000	Because he can't diagnose.
772000	773000	He's not.
773000	774000	Right, no.
774000	775000	He's not a psychiatrist.
775000	776000	He cannot.
776000	777000	So he can only write.
777000	778000	No, no, no.
778000	781000	I think this is his way of diagnosing without saying this is what I think.
781000	782000	Psychologists can make diagnoses.
782000	783000	They just can't prescribe drugs.
783000	786000	I also think this guy with psychology thinks he's like a therapist.
786000	787000	No, he's a psychologist.
787000	788000	He's a doctor.
788000	789000	He's with a doctor?
789000	790000	Yes.
790000	791000	Okay.
791000	794000	He has a PsyD, as they would call it in America, which is a doctorate in psychology.
794000	795000	Okay.
795000	796000	He's a doctor.
796000	797000	Okay.
797000	798000	He's, look, but he's not trying to do a diagnosis.
798000	799000	He only met the guy once.
799000	800000	That's why I'm insisting to this.
800000	807000	But he's explaining literally what your dad said to him.
807000	811000	No, but that's the disconnect, David, because we know that there was absolutely no reason
811000	820000	for him to be culpable any of these in Liber or in Forex trading or any of the scams that
820000	821000	Deutsche Bank was running.
821000	825660	We know that this was a paradox that he had, fear of being culpable, but knowing he was
825660	826660	not culpable.
826660	830000	That's by definition what the test refers to.
830000	831000	Okay.
831000	834000	I mean, and again, it's not.
834000	837000	No one else said this.
837000	839000	No, it's not true.
839000	840000	Who else said it?
840000	841000	The doctor said the physician.
841000	842000	No.
842000	844000	I mean, none of his friends.
844000	846000	We'll get there, because yes, they do.
846000	847000	They do?
847000	848000	Yeah.
848000	849000	Okay.
849000	856000	And look, we've already gone over this yesterday, but the Martin Loat had a very similar type.
856000	861000	I mean, it wasn't about this specifically, but it was, and that's even closer.
861000	862000	That's in December 2013.
862000	866000	It's just a month before your dad dies.
866000	871000	So we know that from a number of sources at this point, we know from the physician, we
871000	876000	know from the psychologist, we know from Martin Loat, and we know from the Paul Weiss lawyers
876000	883000	who visited, remember who visited in London and sensed that he was really upset and terrified
883000	885000	about this investigation.
885000	887000	So around the phone call in the airport.
887000	888000	Right, exactly.
888000	895000	So I mean, we have a pretty, that's four independent data sources that we now have that show that
895000	896000	one's leading up to his death.
896000	898000	I just don't know if that equates to suicide.
898000	902000	I mean, I, there's, my dad was 50.
902000	903000	58.
903000	904000	57, actually.
904000	905000	He turned 58.
905000	906000	Yeah.
906000	907000	He turned 58.
907000	908000	Yeah.
908000	909000	He turned 58.
909000	910000	Yeah.
910000	911000	So.
911000	912000	No, okay.
912000	913000	Sorry.
913000	917000	But my point is, he has been through this before.
917000	921000	He's been in these positions of stress.
921000	925000	This is what he chose for his life, his work to be in his stressful positions, because
925000	926000	he managed it very well.
926000	928000	He's a risk fucking manager.
928000	931000	He could just substitute the word stress for risk.
931000	932000	Right.
932000	934000	That's what he did.
934000	935000	So I mean, I don't see.
935000	937000	That is one of the things I find interesting.
937000	939000	Well, but we know he did commit suicide.
939000	944000	So it's, there's, but there's a possibility of false equivalency.
944000	945000	What do you mean?
945000	949000	He just says, you know, I don't equivocate, equivocate that to suicide.
949000	952000	He said, but we know he did commit suicide.
952000	953000	Right.
953000	954000	You're right.
954000	956000	That doesn't automatically mean that that's what caused it.
956000	958000	But there's, let's keep going.
958000	959000	I understand.
959000	960000	You know what I mean?
960000	961000	I do.
961000	962000	I've been resisting to this since 2014.
962000	963000	I know you have.
963000	969000	And that's really interesting to me because there's, I mean, look, just to be like personal
969000	971000	about this, like I come from a family.
971000	973000	My mom's a psychologist.
973000	976000	Like, you know, I've seen therapists over the years.
976000	984000	I, to me, that's not, there's no like stigma in my brain about people who need help because
984000	986000	they're going through a struggle.
986000	987000	They're struggling.
987000	988000	Like sometimes it's an illness.
988000	990000	Sometimes it's just like a tough time to go through.
990000	998000	There's overwhelming evidence here that your dad was going through a really tough time
998000	1004000	and that he was what he was like communicating to the people around him was that the, a lot,
1004000	1013000	maybe not all of the toughness, but a lot of it was because he was really anxious about
1013000	1015000	stuff that was going on at work.
1015000	1018000	And I mean, again, that's really clear.
1018000	1020000	I mean, yes, I don't disregard that.
1020000	1021000	I don't disregard that.
1021000	1022000	And I accept that.
1022000	1028000	Holy, but I just don't, I just, there's something that has to cross the line to suicide.
1028000	1029000	Clearly.
1029000	1030000	I don't see that yet.
1030000	1031000	Okay.
1031000	1033000	So, okay, well, let's keep going.
1033000	1037000	I mean, I think your theory is that it's just compounds and compounds and compounds and
1037000	1042000	at some point there's a line that crosses or something breaks and then the suicide.
1042000	1044000	And then you lead the path to suicide.
1044000	1046000	I just don't see the breaking point yet.
1046000	1048000	I haven't found it.
1048000	1052000	I mean, maybe it's the work stuff compounding with family stuff.
1052000	1056000	You know, maybe, because my mom, of course, is not the easiest person to deal with either.
1056000	1057000	I think you're thinking about this.
1057000	1058000	I don't look too literal away.
1058000	1061000	Or, you know, I'm not the easiest person to deal with.
1061000	1067000	You know, my sister, there could be a bunch of shit compounded, but I just don't see the
1067000	1068000	line.
1068000	1069000	I don't see where it broke.
1069000	1077000	And if you're bringing up in August of 2013, he's asking Scott Mitchell about estate planning.
1077000	1081000	I mean, you're alluding to the fact that he's already considering suicide at this point.
1081000	1082000	I don't know about that.
1082000	1084000	Why are you bringing it up?
1084000	1085000	I didn't bring it up.
1085000	1086000	You're dead.
1086000	1087000	You brought it up in the book.
1087000	1088000	Why else did you put it into the book?
1088000	1089000	Because it seems relevant.
1089000	1090000	It seems relevant.
1090000	1091000	It seems relevant.
1091000	1092000	Right.
1092000	1095000	Because you are alluding to the fact that he's considering ending his life by this point in
1095000	1096000	time.
1096000	1098000	He's thinking about his demise.
1098000	1099000	I don't think he's necessary.
1099000	1101000	I mean, I don't know what is going on.
1101000	1108000	I said, all I know, I unfortunately never met your dad.
1108000	1114000	And there's, so all I can do is look at the available evidence that people have talked
1114000	1118000	to and the documentary evidence that you've compiled and shared with me.
1118000	1119000	Anyway, so let's keep, I understand what you're saying.
1119000	1120000	That's fine.
1120000	1121000	We don't need to go into resolution numbers.
1121000	1122000	Okay.
1122000	1123000	So, okay.
1123000	1127000	To me actually, obviously it's very interesting that the glimpse of a right into your dad's
1127000	1128000	state of mind.
1128000	1132000	But what's more interesting to me, where I was kind of heading with this, is that it's
1132000	1135000	Deutsche Bank's efforts to cover up what actually happened.
1135000	1136000	Okay.
1136000	1139000	So the coroner schedules this inquest for March 25th.
1139000	1140000	Okay.
1140000	1145000	A few days beforehand, she informs the bank and its lawyers and the lawyers that the bank
1145000	1147000	has hired for your family.
1147000	1153000	And she says how she's going to conduct the hearing.
1153000	1157000	And among other things, she's going to read aloud portions of the doctor's letters to
1157000	1158000	both the physician and-
1158000	1159000	And you were there this year?
1159000	1161000	No, I wasn't at the coroner's.
1161000	1162000	Oh, Jenny was there?
1162000	1164000	No, I can't remember who was there.
1164000	1165000	But it doesn't matter.
1165000	1168000	This is all coming from documents that you've showed me.
1168000	1169000	Okay.
1169000	1174000	So we know that she is planning to read aloud portions of these letters about the include,
1174000	1176000	that are primarily about the anxiety of your dad's suffering.
1176000	1177000	Oh, right.
1177000	1178000	Relate to the government.
1178000	1185000	There was a controversy because he said the coroner revealed the history of depression
1185000	1186000	in the family.
1186000	1188000	Yeah, but that's, again, that's not really what I'm interested in.
1188000	1190000	What I'm interested in, I'll tell you.
1190000	1197000	So noon on March 24th, so this is the day before the hearing that's supposed to occur, someone
1197000	1202000	in the coroner's office, her name is Fiona Wilkner, someone in her office calls one of the lawyers
1202000	1207000	that the bank has hired, informs the lawyer that there will be no reference whatsoever
1207000	1208000	to Bill being under investigation.
1208000	1209000	That's a quote.
1209000	1210000	Say that one more time.
1210000	1214000	There will be, quote, no reference whatsoever to Bill being under investigation.
1214000	1215000	Okay.
1215000	1222000	So that night, March 24th, Wilcox, who's a coroner, she spends the evening looking at
1222000	1228000	the files, going over the inquest files, and she concludes that her obligation is to the
1228000	1233000	truth and not to the bank and not to the family, and that therefore she needs to tell the court
1233000	1236000	everything that's known about the circumstances of his death.
1236000	1239000	And that includes the fact that he was very scared about these investigations.
1239000	1244000	And so the next morning, she arrives at the Royal Court of Justice, meets with the lawyers
1244000	1249000	for your family and for Deutsche Bank, and tells them that she is in fact going to be
1249000	1251000	quoted from the doctor's letters extensively.
1251000	1252000	Okay.
1252000	1258000	So the lawyers, and seems like they went kind of bananas and they protest that we had just
1258000	1263000	been told the opposite the previous day, and quote, she reminded, so one of the lawyers
1263000	1264000	there sums this up.
1264000	1269000	She says she, being the coroner, reminded me that by law she was under a duty to investigate
1269000	1273000	all deaths, fearlessly and without favor.
1273000	1278000	Ultimately, though, it seems that the lawyers kind of wore her down because she agrees
1278000	1279000	to a compromise.
1279000	1283000	And the compromise is that she's going to read the doctor's letters aloud in court,
1283000	1289000	but she's going to read a censored or modified edited version.
1289000	1290000	Right.
1290000	1291000	And so what the lawyers do-
1291000	1292000	The redacted one, I see.
1292000	1293000	Yeah, well, it's like weird.
1293000	1295000	They take a pink highlighter and they cross stuff out.
1295000	1296000	And so-
1296000	1297000	I see in both versions.
1297000	1298000	They're unredacted.
1298000	1299000	Absolutely in both versions.
1299000	1304000	So let me just go through how this looks to someone who hasn't been immersed in this.
1304000	1308000	So he told the psychologists they had been named as a person of interest.
1309000	1310000	That's cut.
1310000	1311000	Okay.
1311000	1315000	Where Mitchell had written that Bill, quote, imagined being investigated, being prosecuted,
1315000	1319000	losing his wealth in his reputation, those words get crossed out and they're replaced
1319000	1322000	with, he imagined, various issues.
1322000	1324000	Okay.
1324000	1326000	Moore's letter, so Moore's the physician.
1326000	1331000	It's described that Bill had, quote, was worried about going to prison or going to bankrupt
1331000	1332000	even though he knew he was innocent.
1332000	1335000	He kept on thinking back over all the thousands of emails he sent over the years.
1335000	1339000	He knew how lawyers can twist things around and was worried that they would take extract from
1339000	1340000	emails.
1340000	1341000	So that's a quote from Moore's letter.
1341000	1345000	That's all deleted and replaced with the following sentences.
1345000	1346000	Oh, okay.
1346000	1348000	Quote, he told me that he'd been extremely anxious.
1348000	1350000	He explained he was retiring in September.
1350000	1355000	So in other words, these fairly clear explanations about what had been going on inside or what
1355000	1361000	your dad had told the doctor and the psychologist or crossed out and it basically replaced with
1361000	1364000	this very sterile language that just says he was anxious.
1364000	1367000	As if the bank, as if the bank got in there with that pink highlighter.
1367000	1368000	The bank do get in there with the highlighter.
1368000	1369000	Yeah.
1369000	1370000	Those were lawyers hired by the bank.
1370000	1371000	To do that.
1371000	1372000	Well, I don't know.
1372000	1373000	She caved, she caved.
1373000	1374000	Yeah, she caved.
1374000	1376000	And so the...
1376000	1377000	I didn't know that.
1377000	1380000	I didn't know that the bank commissioned that pink highlighter.
1380000	1381000	Yes.
1381000	1383000	I didn't know that.
1383000	1387000	I mean, the lawyers are ostensibly, some of them are ostensibly working on your family's
1387000	1389000	behalf and they're paid for it by the bank.
1389000	1390000	Christian suit, saving.
1390000	1391000	What was that?
1391000	1392000	Suit.
1392000	1393000	Seven.
1393000	1394000	What about him though?
1394000	1395000	Once he's suing.
1395000	1398000	Because he was the lead lawyer at that time.
1398000	1401000	Yeah, but well, was he at that time?
1401000	1402000	I'm not sure he was at that.
1402000	1403000	I don't think he had...
1403000	1404000	Remember the memo?
1404000	1405000	No, but that's a year later.
1405000	1406000	Okay.
1406000	1407000	And we're going to get there, don't worry.
1407000	1408000	Okay.
1408000	1414000	But so to me, put this in bucket one, which is that this is pretty clear evidence of...
1414000	1415000	Yes.
1415000	1416000	Yes.
1416000	1417000	I mean, it really is.
1417000	1422000	They're taking this very clear language from two doctors who say this is what you got.
1422000	1423000	Yeah, I got it.
1423000	1424000	You're right.
1424000	1425000	I didn't know that they did that.
1425000	1427000	I thought that was something that the...
1427000	1432000	I thought they wanted to stay neutral, the corner, and like they didn't want to...
1432000	1433000	They just wanted...
1433000	1436000	The point was he killed himself and they were just trying to say he's dead and this is our
1436000	1440000	report, nothing to do with the reasons why they didn't want to get into that.
1440000	1444000	If you go through these emails that went back and forth, they explained in great detail exactly
1444000	1445000	how this went down.
1445000	1446000	I didn't know that.
1446000	1447000	Okay.
1447000	1448000	Yeah, show me that.
1448000	1449000	You forgot.
1449000	1450000	No, no.
1450000	1451000	Between the bank and Wilcox.
1451000	1452000	No, no, no.
1452000	1453000	It's not.
1453000	1458000	It's the memos that go back and forth that you fished out of your mom's files.
1458000	1461000	Oh, I thought you had something between the bank and Wilcox.
1461000	1463000	The lawyers are hired by the bank.
1463000	1466000	I know about communications between Wilcox and the bank.
1466000	1471000	We have reports that you showed me that show the lawyer.
1471000	1472000	I know those reports.
1472000	1474000	I mean something additional to that.
1474000	1476000	No, that's from there, man.
1476000	1477000	Oh, I know.
1477000	1478000	Okay.
1479000	1480000	So next, let's move on.
1480000	1483000	So why was your dad so worried about the live one investigation?
1483000	1484000	It is an obvious question, right?
1484000	1490000	He said this to both doctors and the bank obviously seems like it does not want that coming out
1490000	1491000	in the court.
1491000	1492000	So why?
1492000	1494000	Why was he so scared?
1494000	1497000	So this brings us to Mark Stein.
1497000	1501000	So you found in your dad's files an email from Mark Stein.
1501000	1505000	He's the lawyer at Simpson Thatcher, which is a very high price corporate law firm.
1505000	1509000	And you can tell that your father is pretty worried.
1509000	1516000	He keeps asking or at least on one or two occasions asks Stein what's going on with DOJ.
1516000	1518000	Stein replies total silence.
1518000	1520000	He's a slippery fuck.
1520000	1524000	That guy called me a few times.
1524000	1526000	Yeah, tell him.
1526000	1527000	I told you, remember?
1527000	1528000	I did not.
1528000	1530000	I called him a few times and I asked to talk to him.
1530000	1531000	I said, hello.
1531000	1532000	Very sorry to hear about your dad.
1532000	1535000	There was absolutely nothing going on with him.
1535000	1538000	He wasn't under any investigations.
1538000	1541000	When we called him in, it was just sort of like a cattle call.
1541000	1546000	You know, sometimes these regulators, they're calling thousands of bankers at a time.
1546000	1547000	They're looking for stuff.
1547000	1549000	And that's all that this was about.
1549000	1554000	And I said to him, excuse me, but I have fucking emails between you two saying, please send me this file
1554000	1555000	because it's important.
1555000	1557000	And then he stopped communicating.
1557000	1559000	And then he never calls me back.
1559000	1560000	Wait, no.
1560000	1564000	And then I call him again and I say, well, can we talk about Faisola and Mikaela Faisola?
1564000	1566000	And he says, yes, I'd love to talk about this.
1566000	1568000	Let's set up a date and time.
1568000	1570000	Phone tag for three fucking months.
1570000	1571000	No response.
1571000	1572000	Emails.
1572000	1575000	Yeah, he clearly did not want to talk to you.
1575000	1580000	So I think you already know this, but the reason your dad was involved in this live or investigation
1580000	1582000	is not that he had done anything.
1582000	1585000	He hadn't participated in any fraud or manipulation.
1585000	1586000	Chief risk guy.
1586000	1588000	No, it's that he missed something.
1588000	1589000	Oh, really?
1589000	1590000	Yeah.
1590000	1595000	So back in 2009, Christian Bittar, who was a big live or trader.
1595000	1597000	I remember this from your book.
1597000	1598000	Yeah.
1598000	1600000	Well, I don't think this was actually in the book.
1600000	1603000	There's another Deutsche Bank guy, Gio Madoff.
1603000	1605000	Oh, no, I remember this from your search terms.
1605000	1606000	Yes.
1606000	1607000	Yes.
1607000	1608000	That's right.
1608000	1615000	So Bittar back in 2009 was due.
1615000	1616000	And Anshu Jain had agreed.
1616000	1617000	Wasn't he recently arrested?
1617000	1619000	He was recently sentenced to jail.
1619000	1620000	Sent to jail?
1620000	1621000	Yeah.
1621000	1624000	So he pleaded guilty to fraud.
1624000	1629000	So he, at the time, though, Anshu Jain had worked at a very lucrative contract for Christian Bittar.
1629000	1633000	This is, again, back 10 years ago.
1633000	1637000	He was the one from his desk when it was like 500 million?
1637000	1638000	Yeah.
1638000	1640000	They were making an absolute killing.
1640000	1648000	Anshu had agreed to a compensation arrangement where Bittar would basically take home a portion of his winnings.
1648000	1651000	And so he won a lot.
1651000	1654000	In part, Bittar's obviously was manipulating.
1654000	1655000	What's his percentage?
1655000	1659000	I don't know what the percentage was off the top of my head, but I do know what he was owed, roughly.
1659000	1664000	So he was due to get a bonus in the neighborhood of 50 or 60 or 70 million dollars.
1664000	1665000	Wow.
1665000	1666000	It's about 5%.
1666000	1667000	That was...
1667000	1669000	It was about 500 million, wasn't it?
1669000	1671000	Yeah, so that'd be 10%.
1671000	1674000	I think it probably was about 10%.
1674000	1675000	But I'm not certain about that.
1675000	1679000	In any case, that's a huge amount of money to just hand out to a trader.
1679000	1684000	And so there were a couple of reviews that were started internally into...
1684000	1688000	People were kind of dispatched to look at how he had made all that money.
1688000	1695000	So there's one review called a review by the Business Integrity Review Group, which was a loan employee at Deutsche
1695000	1697000	sent to go through Bittar's emails.
1697000	1700000	And Bittar's friend, or I think it was from Senegal.
1700000	1703000	So he's a native French speaker.
1703000	1709000	And the guy who was assigned to go through this doesn't even speak French, so they can't understand any of the communications.
1709000	1712000	But Anshu asked your dad to take a look as well.
1712000	1715000	And your dad did what's called a look-back.
1715000	1719000	And he's supposed to go in there and figure out if everything was above board,
1719000	1723000	and the profits were legitimate as opposed to being the result of fraud or manipulation or something like that.
1723000	1730000	And so your dad spent a couple of weeks going through all the financial data and interviewing traders on Bittar's team.
1730000	1735000	And his conclusion is a very narrowly crafted conclusion.
1735000	1746000	It was that Bittar and his traders had a plausible strategy to make money off of interest rates moving in very specific directions,
1746000	1748000	by very specific amounts.
1748000	1753000	And he stopped short of addressing the question of whether Bittar was manipulated live,
1753000	1759000	or he basically gave a blessing for this bonus to get paid for Bittar to be able to continue doing business.
1759000	1764000	And this turns in as a huge mistake in retrospect.
1764000	1770000	Bittar is engaged in what turns out to be a large, very lucrative criminal conspiracy.
1770000	1775000	And that's going to result in the bank paying billions of dollars in penalties.
1775000	1778000	And then people going to jail.
1778000	1785000	And the Justice Department at that point, so this is now in 2013,
1785000	1792000	so four years later, has started this, a number of investigations, including into Deutsche,
1792000	1795000	which was in the process of drawing a criminal charge against people.
1795000	1802000	And so there, your dad was under the impression he was a person of interest in this investigation.
1802000	1809000	And, you know, there's no reason to think he was going to have really good in trouble,
1809000	1811000	but could his reputation be severely damaged?
1811000	1814000	Could he have huge legal fees? That's not impossible.
1814000	1823000	So that is my understanding of why your dad was so worried about live war.
1824000	1826000	So why did he make this mistake?
1826000	1833000	Is there anybody, if you've spoken to anyone that said maybe he didn't look at all the documents,
1833000	1834000	did he have some sort of...
1834000	1837000	One theory I have, and we'll get to this later, is that,
1837000	1841000	and we know now what your dad wrote in his note to auction, right?
1841000	1842000	Oh, right.
1842000	1846000	He talks about carelessness, and sloppiness, and betraying his trust.
1846000	1849000	Betraying his trust, yeah.
1849000	1853000	And it, I don't know. I mean, it's, I don't know what those words mean,
1853000	1855000	but this is one possibility.
1855000	1857000	It seems like.
1857000	1858000	Okay.
1858000	1859000	Okay.
1859000	1866000	So, a year later, so this is now early 2015, a guy named Victor Rocco.
1866000	1869000	It's just a Deutsche Bank's office at 60 Wall Street.
1869000	1875000	And Rocco is someone who had been introduced to your mom a couple weeks after your dad's death.
1875000	1879000	And he's a lawyer. He's a former federal prosecutor, turned private lawyer.
1879000	1886000	And he is going there to have this meeting with Christian Seven and Simon Dodds,
1886000	1891000	who's another very senior lawyer at the bank, about this internal review that they had conducted
1891000	1894000	into the circumstances of your dad's death.
1894000	1902000	And it, again, you know this already, but there's, there turns out there's a very, like,
1902000	1905000	you know, kind of narrative explanation of what went on in that meeting.
1905000	1906000	Okay.
1906000	1910000	And it, and again, this is something you've shared with me, so you can know this already,
1910000	1919000	but Seven starts off by noting that he had been at the farewell lunch that Antje had hosted for Bill
1919000	1924000	back in November of 2013, and that Bill had seemed happy.
1924000	1928000	No signs of him being a guy who's going to kill himself in two months.
1928000	1935000	And then Seven and Dodds walk the lawyer, Rocco, through this review,
1935000	1939000	and they acknowledge that the LIBOR investigation might have caused him some heartburn,
1939000	1942000	and he might have had some legal exposure there.
1942000	1944000	We're talking about the memo.
1944000	1946000	Yes, this is the memo.
1946000	1951000	And then the guy breathes through this laundry list of other issues that Bill had been dealing with,
1951000	1954000	and there's DBTCA and the huge mess there.
1954000	1960000	They oddly assert that Bill, quote, was not responsible for DBTCA,
1960000	1963000	even though he was a member of the oversight board.
1963000	1965000	In which scam was this referring to?
1965000	1966000	The basket trades?
1966000	1967000	DBTCA?
1967000	1968000	Yeah.
1968000	1973000	Well, DBTCA, the biggest issue there was that the Federal Reserve was,
1973000	1976000	I mean, DBTCA was kind of a dumping ground for all these problems,
1976000	1979000	and so basket trades were there.
1979000	1985000	The Russian mirror trades, which have another separate investigation, are there.
1985000	1990000	The biggest concern, though, is that the financial data that DBTCA has produced into the Fed,
1990000	1995000	the New York Fed, is just like sloppy and wrong,
1995000	2001000	and the Fed, they're kind of pulling the wool over the regulator's eyes on the stress tests.
2001000	2004000	So there's a lot of problems there.
2004000	2010000	The review also looks at what impact, if any, Boffin's rejection of Bill for those promotions,
2010000	2017000	what effect those had on him, and the conclusion is that it didn't affect him at all.
2017000	2024000	It turns out, so the bank produces a report that is kind of summarizing conclusions,
2024000	2027000	and the report is very sensitive.
2027000	2030000	It's only shared with a few members of the bank's board of directors.
2031000	2039000	A number of board members complained to the bank's chairman that they were not allowed to see the report into the death,
2039000	2045000	and one of them told me that, quote, I was very suspicious.
2045000	2048000	And when Rocco goes there, he doesn't get to see it either.
2048000	2054000	He gets kind of a snippet of, he gets kind of a summary of what it found,
2054000	2059000	and the summary is that, quote, nothing that shows a direct link between Bill's death and his work at Deutsche Bank.
2059000	2061000	Of course you're going to say that.
2061000	2063000	And aren't you commissioned this?
2063000	2064000	Yeah.
2064000	2065000	You did?
2065000	2066000	Yeah.
2066000	2074000	And so one of the kind of things they used to validate, just kind of questionable premise,
2074000	2078000	is that seven notes that in the months since the internal review wrapped up,
2078000	2083000	Bill's name hadn't come up in public, connected to any of these investigations.
2083000	2091000	And, of course, that's not true, because he had been named publicly in the Senate report into the basket options.
2091000	2095000	And so Rocco notes, when he summarizes this meaning to your mom,
2095000	2100000	that this suggests the Deutsche Investigation, quote, was not as exhaustive,
2100000	2104000	not as dynamic as both Dodd and Seven had described it.
2104000	2107000	He notes that it, quote, it seemed carefully scripted,
2107000	2111000	and certainly both Simon and Christian were very careful in what they said to me.
2111000	2114000	Down played his involvement in a bunch of things,
2114000	2118000	and Simon, Seven and Dodd's, quote, could not explain the coroner's findings
2118000	2122000	or the medical records that established that Bill was fearful of civil liability
2122000	2125000	and perhaps even prosecution because of his work at the bank.
2125000	2133000	So now we've got, from my perspective, at least two data points that point to the bank really not being,
2133000	2138000	at best not being very transparent about what happened at worst, participating in a whitewash.
2138000	2139000	Yeah, I know you're right.
2139000	2140000	Yeah.
2140000	2145000	And then in the memo, they also randomly bring up
2145000	2149000	that they did not take these files from my father's computer.
2149000	2153000	Yeah, and I'm just not even addressing that in the book, honestly.
2153000	2154000	Like, there's...
2154000	2155000	Why?
2155000	2157000	Well, I'm addressing that they did take them.
2157000	2160000	But why not address the fact that they claim they did not?
2163000	2164000	I mean, that's very odd.
2164000	2165000	It is odd, right?
2165000	2166000	It is odd.
2166000	2167000	It is odd.
2167000	2168000	I agree.
2169000	2171000	I mean, is that not another data point for you?
2171000	2172000	Yeah, maybe it is.
2172000	2173000	Maybe it is.
2173000	2174000	Yeah.
2174000	2176000	I mean, we have witnesses that this guy came.
2176000	2177000	There's many...
2177000	2178000	No, I know.
2178000	2179000	And Beth...
2179000	2180000	It wasn't just me.
2180000	2181000	No, I know.
2181000	2184000	Dude, if it was just you, I probably wouldn't be trusting your memory at that point.
2184000	2186000	No, because you were just like, it was very traumatic for you.
2186000	2187000	Yes, it was traumatic.
2187000	2188000	Beth confirms it.
2188000	2189000	I remember Beth confirms it.
2189000	2191000	Michael Morandi, he'll confirm it for you as well.
2191000	2192000	He was there.
2192000	2193000	Beth confirms it.
2193000	2194000	That's all I need.
2194000	2195000	Okay.
2195000	2196000	And there's...
2196000	2197000	Yeah.
2197000	2198000	Yeah.
2198000	2199000	So...
2199000	2200000	But why not put that in the book?
2200000	2201000	Yeah, I hear you.
2201000	2202000	Yeah.
2202000	2203000	No particular reason.
2203000	2204000	Okay.
2204000	2205000	Yeah.
2205000	2206000	We'll make a note there, David.
2206000	2207000	Put it in the book.
2207000	2209000	This is all being recorded, man.
2209000	2210000	Clickety-clack into your fingers.
2210000	2211000	Clickety-clack.
2211000	2212000	Clickety-clack.
2212000	2213000	Chop, chop.
2213000	2214000	Come on.
2214000	2215000	All right.
2215000	2216000	Okay, so you know what?
2216000	2217000	I'm actually just going to pause this for a sec.
2217000	2218000	Yeah.
2218000	2219000	And...
2219000	2220000	Should I pause this, too?
2220000	2221000	You don't matter.
2221000	2222000	I just want to break up these files a little bit.
2222000	2223000	Right.
2223000	2224000	It's too big.
2224000	2225000	Yeah.
2225000	2226000	Okay.
2226000	2227000	Um...
2227000	2228000	Well, Marie just texted.
2228000	2229000	She's on her way.
2229000	2230000	She's going to clean the car.
2230000	2231000	You doing okay?
2231000	2232000	Uh, she's sick, so she bombed in the car.
2232000	2233000	Who did?
2233000	2234000	Marie.
2234000	2235000	Marie bombed it in the car.
2235000	2236000	Yeah.
2236000	2237000	No, I mean, she pulled over to vomit.
2237000	2238000	Wow.
2238000	2239000	That's not good.
2239000	2240000	Do you have this...
2240000	2241000	Stomach logo on there?
2241000	2242000	I don't know.
2242000	2243000	Okay.
2243000	2244000	Okay.
2244000	2245000	Okay.
2245000	2246000	Okay.
2246000	2247000	Okay.
2247000	2248000	Okay.
2248000	2249000	Okay.
2249000	2250000	Okay.
2250000	2251000	Okay.
2251000	2252000	Okay.
2252000	2253000	Okay.
2253000	2254000	Okay.
2254000	2255000	Okay.
2255000	2256000	Okay.
2256000	2257000	Okay.
2257000	2258000	Okay.
2258000	2259000	I don't know.
2259000	2260000	Bomber to the street.
2260000	2261000	I feel better.
2261000	2262000	I ate something and I didn't vomit.
2262000	2264000	Um, she's going to go clean the car.
2264000	2265000	She'll be right back.
2265000	2266060	She'll be back looking 30 minutes.
2266060	2267060	Okay.
2267060	2268000	I don't know, if she's okay.
2268000	2269500	I think she'll be okay.
2269500	2276000	It must have been food poisoning, or...
2276000	2277000	You want me to go?
2277000	2278000	Yeah.
2278000	2279000	Let's go already, alright.
2279000	2280000	Okay.
2280000	2281000	Um, that's interesting.
2281000	2283000	Yeah, that's kind of fun.
2283000	2284440	It's interesting, I just think that-
2284440	2286680	Wait, can we wait and turn this on before you start?
2286680	2287680	Yeah, right, yeah.
2292720	2294080	Yeah, David, I think it's,
2296120	2298480	it is a good data points,
2298480	2302640	but I really think it's important to add this bit here.
2302640	2305000	Because not only they're accusing me of lying,
2305000	2307800	but they're trying to cover something up
2307800	2310360	that is absurd to do so
2310360	2314120	when there are witnesses that can verify this guy's existence.
2314120	2317600	Okay, so now, yeah, no, I hear,
2317600	2319280	I mean, I'm not sure how important it is,
2319280	2320240	but I definitely see your point,
2320240	2321680	and there's no particular reason that's not in there.
2321680	2323960	Why are you saying you're not sure how important it is?
2323960	2325280	It's just that they are just-
2325280	2326840	It's like-
2326840	2327920	To me, what's the important part
2327920	2332000	is that they took the files, not that they're,
2332000	2332840	I don't know.
2332840	2333680	I hear what you're saying.
2333680	2334520	I don't feel strongly about this.
2334520	2335600	Let's not bicker about this,
2335600	2337520	because there's, I definitely see what you're saying.
2337520	2338360	I don't want to bicker.
2338360	2339680	There's no particular reason why not.
2339680	2340800	I just honestly want to understand
2340800	2344040	why you think it's not a big deal.
2344040	2345280	Because to me, it is a big deal.
2345280	2346480	I'm not saying that it is,
2346480	2347800	I'm fighting with you to say what it is.
2347800	2350640	I just want to know in your head, why is it not-
2350640	2352640	That they're denying that they took it?
2352640	2353980	Yeah, yeah.
2353980	2355760	Because I don't know why they denied it.
2355760	2359600	Like, maybe Kristen Southern just didn't know, for example.
2359600	2360680	Like, I mean, I don't know.
2360680	2363520	There's, the important part from my perspective
2363520	2364360	is that they took it.
2364360	2366480	And there's plenty of evidence at this point.
2366480	2368240	But if you didn't know why we put it into the,
2368240	2372280	why even take the time to put it into this very heavily-
2372280	2374360	But that memo is not what they produced, right?
2374360	2377640	That's what the lawyer for your mom produced.
2377640	2379520	And so we don't know how much emphasis they gave it.
2379520	2382720	Again, I don't really disagree with you to be honest with you.
2382720	2385320	So there's, maybe it does belong in there.
2385320	2387600	So, okay.
2387600	2392440	So, we now switch over to Mododipasky for a moment.
2392440	2393280	Great.
2393920	2398200	And so, the way I've framed this here,
2398200	2400880	that you're about to discover another reason that your dad
2400880	2403520	isn't feeling bad about stuff from the non-affected bank.
2403520	2409520	So, and one of the things you find in your father's Yahoo account
2409520	2413680	is that Bill had repeatedly warned his colleagues
2413680	2417000	that these Mododipasky transactions were very risky.
2417000	2418720	And it's not like financial risk,
2418720	2420720	so much as reputational risk for the bank.
2420720	2427960	And he had, like one time after another, cautioned Faisola.
2427960	2431160	He'd asked that this be elevated to Anshu.
2431160	2433240	And just no one listened.
2433240	2435920	By the way, I've learned that,
2435920	2437520	I should have mentioned this earlier.
2437520	2439120	So, you're going to kick it out of this.
2439120	2445400	Anshu had a nephew who worked at Deutsche Bank.
2445400	2448720	And you know, the guy, some of Anshu's colleagues
2448720	2452920	felt quite a bit of pressure to find jobs for this guy inside the bank.
2452920	2455320	Guess what job he landed on, actually.
2455320	2462640	He was one of the guys exporting this Mododipasky style transaction
2462640	2464120	to other banks around the world.
2464120	2464640	Really?
2464640	2465240	Yeah.
2465240	2469440	So, they use Mododipasky transactions.
2469440	2471000	One of the reasons this is so lucrative, right?
2471000	2474160	They use it as a model for things they could do with other banks.
2474160	2474680	What?
2474680	2477840	How is that, what, just to overpay?
2477840	2480920	Well, no, they're basically the...
2480920	2483480	To buy up the debt and overpay for something?
2483480	2484240	No, no, no, no.
2484240	2486600	The MoneyDipasky transaction at its heart is,
2486600	2488000	and again, I think you probably know this already,
2488000	2490320	but there is, it's...
2490320	2493360	So, MoneyDipasky is facing really big losses on these derivatives
2493360	2495720	that Deutsche Bank had cooked up years earlier.
2495720	2497800	And so, they create these new class of derivatives
2497800	2499520	that in the very short term,
2499520	2502200	is going to send a bunch of money to Mododipasky,
2502200	2505440	which allows them to pretend to kind of conceal the losses
2505440	2506520	that they would otherwise be facing.
2506640	2508400	Is the Antivenet apart?
2508400	2509240	No, Antivenet...
2509240	2510600	That's Santorini.
2510600	2511480	That's Santorini.
2511480	2513520	Antivenet, just get that out of your head.
2513520	2516000	There's the...
2516000	2520200	So, it gives a short-term cash infusion to MoneyDipasky
2520200	2522400	so that they can pretend they didn't actually lose all this money
2522400	2523920	that they really did lost.
2523920	2525400	But then, over the next several years,
2525400	2528640	they have to pay back that money to Deutsche Bank
2528640	2530320	through these other transactions.
2530320	2532600	And as long as they're very profitable,
2532600	2534160	no one will overnet.
2534160	2535640	Obviously, that doesn't work out that way.
2535640	2538080	Anyway, that means the debt just sort of floats
2538080	2541320	without being landing on any books for a while.
2541320	2542360	Yeah, kind of.
2545320	2549800	So, it now becomes clear inside the bank
2549800	2552240	that they're using similar transactions,
2552240	2555120	model in the Mododipasky one, for other banks
2555120	2558680	in places like Brazil and, I forget where else,
2558680	2559680	but a couple other places.
2559680	2560960	I'm using nephew.
2560960	2561800	Yeah.
2562800	2566040	And your dad warns that these, quote,
2566040	2567520	may be a rounding error at this point,
2567520	2569000	but they're growing quickly.
2569000	2570240	Well, that's strange, also,
2570240	2574000	because Anshu claims that he never signed off on this deal,
2574000	2574840	or this...
2574840	2575680	Yeah, that's...
2575680	2577400	I don't know if Anshu signed off on it or not,
2577400	2578720	that he certainly was aware of it.
2578720	2579560	Right.
2579560	2581200	And he had the concerns escalated to him.
2581200	2582040	Yeah.
2582040	2584200	I don't know if he's actually said he was not aware of it.
2584200	2586320	I think that's what Dirk told me.
2586320	2588080	But, you know, that's not, that's...
2588080	2588920	Right.
2588920	2589760	That's not...
2589760	2590600	Okay.
2590720	2591560	Okay.
2592720	2593560	Sorry, Dirk.
2595640	2598000	And so this, I note here, is,
2598000	2600720	this is a very reminiscent of Warren's County.
2600720	2601560	Yeah.
2601560	2603160	Where your dad sees these derivative transactions
2603160	2606880	piling up, they look really bad to him.
2606880	2607720	Yeah.
2607720	2609680	He, like, warns in writing repeatedly,
2609680	2610600	and no one listens.
2610600	2613120	And, sure enough, this, as you know,
2613120	2614640	blows up in Deutsche Bank's face.
2614640	2617600	And one of the pieces of evidence that's then used
2617600	2619680	against the bank and against Faisola
2619720	2622760	is the fact that your dad had warned in writing.
2622760	2623600	His memories.
2623600	2624440	Yeah.
2624440	2625280	Exactly.
2625280	2626480	It's very similar to Warren's County in that regard.
2626480	2631320	And how does that, and Faisola and his wife
2631320	2635480	are obviously close friends of your father and mother.
2635480	2639080	And your dad's gotta be feeling
2640200	2641960	like a little bit guilty about that, I imagine,
2641960	2644120	because he, he...
2644120	2644960	But he told Faisola, no.
2644960	2645800	He wrote.
2645800	2646640	He told Faisola, no.
2646640	2647480	Yeah, right.
2647480	2649400	But now the thing that he put in writing
2649400	2653560	is being used to gin up criminal charges
2653560	2654640	against his good friend.
2656320	2661320	You know, the criminal charges came way later after his death.
2662240	2664080	That's true, but the criminal investigation
2664080	2665880	was well underway, and it was clear at that point
2665880	2668720	that these emails that your dad had sent
2668720	2670840	warning were going to be a problem.
2670840	2672520	They were a crucial piece of evidence.
2672520	2676240	That showed that not only was the bank doing something naughty,
2676240	2678800	but the bank knew that what it was doing was naughty.
2679840	2680760	I mean, that's...
2680760	2681600	Okay.
2682440	2683600	Look, that doesn't mean,
2683600	2685120	that doesn't mean that could prove anything to us.
2685120	2687280	No, I don't, my brain goes directly
2687280	2688680	just Faisola's showing up today.
2688680	2691520	My mother's saying, call McKaley, call McKaley.
2691520	2692360	So...
2692360	2694440	Yeah, I'm not sure there's anything to that other than
2694440	2695920	that they were friends and lived nearby.
2695920	2697680	Just putting out there, this is a tangent
2697680	2699280	that my mind went to.
2699280	2701560	Well, the tangent my mind goes to is that
2701560	2703600	you around this time, having found all the stuff
2703600	2706920	in both of your parents' emails, you emailed Faisola.
2706920	2709840	And you asked him why he thought
2709840	2710880	your dad had killed himself.
2710880	2714240	And Faisola initially deflects the question
2714240	2716680	and suggests that you not read too much
2716680	2720400	into reports of Bill being under investigation.
2720400	2723200	And he says, quote, unfortunately, we live in a world
2723200	2725000	where banks are perceived as evil.
2725000	2726880	And therefore, senior people are unfairly attacked
2726880	2729440	by the media, politicians and regulators.
2729440	2733600	And you keep pressing and Faisola eventually
2733600	2735000	offers a more complete theory
2735000	2737320	about what had been going on inside your dad's head.
2737320	2740840	And it is, quote, I do not think that depression
2740840	2742880	was caused by a specific work situation,
2742880	2745080	but definitely work has contributed to it.
2745080	2746920	And in the last few years, the whole industry
2746920	2749280	has entered a very difficult and dark time.
2749280	2751560	We all got attacked and vilified.
2751560	2753640	I think he realized the end of his generation
2753640	2755280	of managers was approaching.
2755280	2757160	And maybe he could not deal with it.
2757160	2759000	Definitely the fact that in the last two years,
2759000	2761440	he did not have a clear job due to boffin opposition
2761440	2762920	did not help.
2762920	2763760	So...
2763800	2765200	I just didn't like that he blamed boffin.
2765200	2767480	He blamed that the thing that everyone else wants to blame
2767480	2770040	is that he didn't get the, that they blocked him.
2770040	2770880	I didn't like that.
2770880	2772720	And I don't like the fact that he's vilified.
2772720	2773720	I think this is a pretty...
2773720	2774960	He's saying he's being vilified
2774960	2776840	and he's saying my dad's being vilified.
2776840	2777680	And that...
2777680	2778920	Well, he's saying a lot more than that.
2778920	2780520	He's saying bankers are being vilified.
2780520	2781480	That's the first thing he says.
2781480	2782960	That's not the second thing he's saying.
2782960	2787080	He says that there's...
2787080	2789680	He's really saying that, first of all, your dad was depressed.
2789680	2791320	Second of all, there wasn't a specific thing.
2791320	2792440	There was just all of this.
2792560	2794680	There were all these investigations.
2794680	2796360	He's saying, I think he realized
2796360	2797880	the end of the generation of managers
2797880	2799520	was approaching and maybe he could not deal with it.
2799520	2800840	That's fine, Donna, I accept.
2800840	2803160	Which reminds me a lot of what we talked about yesterday.
2803160	2806560	Yeah, with the Dixon fuckers.
2806560	2809480	The Troy Dixon gang of sheds.
2809480	2812760	So this is all beginning to make a little bit more sense
2812760	2813600	to me at this point.
2813600	2815880	And honestly, I think it was making a little more sense
2815880	2816920	to you at the time too, if I recall.
2816920	2818520	This theory is, yes.
2819680	2820800	Okay.
2820800	2821640	So.
2823080	2825000	This one theory, because there are others.
2825000	2827480	But yes, it makes a little sense.
2827480	2828720	Wait, sorry.
2828720	2829760	What's one theory?
2831000	2834960	That this isn't him feeling like it's out of control
2834960	2836960	because he's a generational thing
2836960	2838080	and now he doesn't...
2838080	2839600	People aren't listening to him anymore.
2839600	2840680	He's not the...
2843400	2845640	The statue he had before is the voice of reason
2845640	2847600	where everyone was worshiping him as he asked,
2847600	2848440	Bill, what do we do here?
2848440	2849280	What do we do here?
2849280	2851200	He's being disrespected.
2851200	2854760	He's being circumvented.
2857200	2859840	You know, how have I missed this?
2859840	2861360	I don't know.
2861360	2866360	But I've missed here is your dad's notes.
2868320	2869160	How did we...
2870240	2871720	Because that's when you were at the university club.
2871720	2872880	Yeah.
2872880	2874040	Did we go over that yesterday?
2874040	2874880	Yeah.
2874880	2875720	Oh, we did, okay.
2876800	2878320	Yeah, you were, I'm sorry.
2878360	2881000	So just to reread Anshu's, his note to Anshu now,
2881000	2883240	because I think that's helpful for Remake,
2883240	2885720	continuing to keep in mind the framing of all this
2885720	2887400	in his mind at the time.
2887400	2889880	She says, Anshu, you were so good to me
2889880	2892240	and I've repaid you with carelessness.
2892240	2893480	I've betrayed your trust
2893480	2895760	and hid my horrible nature from you.
2895760	2899080	I can't even begin to fathom the damage I have done.
2899080	2901400	I am eternally sorry and condemned.
2901400	2904120	And then we combine that, take that,
2904120	2906560	which raises obviously a ton of questions.
2906560	2910560	Take that with this nugget from the note he left
2910560	2913320	to your mom and it says, even my career,
2913320	2917400	which was once a source of pride, ended anonymously.
2917400	2919000	I look back at it with shame,
2919000	2922080	another gift that I was careless with and poisoned.
2922080	2925120	My role as a director of DBTCA is burdensome
2925120	2927320	and something I'm not suited for.
2927320	2929200	However, I have to pretend to enjoy it
2929200	2932080	because it is my only remaining source of status.
2932080	2934360	I can't look back, I can't look forward.
2936760	2938240	So that's some heavy shit.
2938240	2940200	But just fucking be careful with that
2940200	2942040	because you're taking the ramblings of a guy
2942040	2943960	that's kind of lost and gone over the edge
2943960	2946160	just before he kills himself.
2946160	2949040	And the self-deprecation and the self-annihilation.
2949040	2949880	That's not self-deprecation.
2949880	2953000	Yeah, the self-hatred is there.
2953000	2954120	It's self-hatred, yeah.
2954120	2956600	Yes, the self-hatred is there and it's present
2956600	2960280	and it's clouding all his judgments, okay?
2960280	2963560	And so it's seeping out into his words, his verbiage,
2963560	2964520	everything.
2964960	2967240	So be careful not to put too much stake in that
2967240	2969600	because sometimes we all get down on ourselves
2969600	2972440	and we hate ourselves and we only see bad shit.
2972440	2974000	And that colors everything else.
2974000	2974840	No.
2974840	2976960	But if you focus on something, if it's not you
2976960	2978600	and you're looking at someone else's...
2978600	2979440	But to the extent that...
2979440	2981840	No, if you're looking at someone else's vomit
2981840	2984040	of self-hatred and you look through it
2984040	2985160	and you find these little pieces
2985160	2988240	that were eaten a long time ago, they're coming out,
2988240	2990720	you can't focus on that as making a data point.
2990720	2993680	That's, first of all, a disgusting analogy.
2993720	2995680	And second of all, I completely,
2995680	2997320	I think that's very smart what you're saying.
2997320	3000280	But to the extent that our goal here
3000280	3003680	is to better understand why your dad killed himself,
3003680	3006920	looking at his self-hatred and how he expresses
3006920	3009160	his self-hatred, I think is highly relevant
3009160	3011480	when it's in the context of all these other data points.
3011480	3012560	So...
3012560	3014000	Right, but that's what I'm afraid of
3014000	3019000	is that we're building a false context of data points,
3019560	3022640	a false house, easily broken, a glass house,
3022680	3024440	one little window could smash it.
3024440	3027640	I'm just not thinking Billy Joel's album, Glass House.
3028680	3029520	Anyway, this...
3029520	3030360	Sorry, you lost me there.
3030360	3031200	No, I just...
3031200	3032040	My mind went on a thing.
3032040	3032880	Okay, so...
3032880	3034120	But no, no, no, but do you get what I'm saying?
3034120	3037120	Just be careful because if you use that,
3037120	3040080	if you use this self-hatred spewage
3040080	3042600	for your data point to support your other theory,
3042600	3046040	I think that it's very wobbly.
3046040	3047760	I mean, you have, if you're going home
3047760	3049800	and you have a terrible day at work
3049800	3051520	and the wife is driving you nuts
3051560	3053240	and the kids are going crazy
3053240	3055080	and then your mom calls and your dad calls
3055080	3056680	and you lost something, you're just like,
3056680	3058520	oh, and then all of a sudden you take it inward
3058520	3061760	and you maybe saw my fault, I'm an asshole, I'm an idiot.
3061760	3063360	And you start writing all this stuff down
3063360	3065040	about just to get it out of you.
3065040	3065880	I'm an asshole, I'm an idiot,
3065880	3068000	I can't believe I did this, it's all my fault.
3068000	3070400	And then you go to sleep and then a few days later
3070400	3071960	you wake up and you feel a lot better,
3071960	3074600	you look back at the thing, you're like, oh my God.
3074600	3076320	I can't believe I blame myself for all this.
3076320	3079520	You know, how ridiculous, this obviously is not my fault.
3079560	3081640	This obviously, my mom's the one that said this,
3081640	3083080	so that's why I reacted like this.
3083080	3085720	And you look back and you use your rational brain,
3085720	3087080	you look through it and you realize
3087080	3090440	this was you expaling an expulsion
3090440	3093080	or expounding all these things
3093080	3094680	that you were inside you at the time.
3094680	3096240	But you don't go through them and use them
3096240	3100440	as a data point to build a theory as to anything else.
3100440	3103400	It's almost irrelevant in that sense.
3103400	3104360	I disagree.
3104360	3105400	Almost irrelevant.
3105400	3107640	The most relevant is the self-hatred
3107640	3110400	in the bigger picture, but the details of the self-hatred,
3110400	3112680	I don't think are that relevant.
3112680	3116320	Except that we know, first of all, they killed himself.
3116320	3119640	And we know what he said to his psychologist,
3119640	3123440	and to his doctor, and numerous of his friends,
3123440	3126840	and his lawyer, and it all says the same thing, Val.
3126840	3127760	Okay.
3127760	3129520	You know what I mean, I agree with you
3129520	3131360	that we shouldn't take these in isolation.
3131360	3132400	We shouldn't. Yeah, yeah.
3132400	3133400	But we're not.
3133400	3138400	I mean, this is a lot of evidence.
3138680	3140000	Okay.
3140000	3140840	I hear you.
3143080	3144240	But it isn't.
3144240	3146360	Like when he says he betrayed Anshun.
3146360	3147960	I don't think he didn't literally betray him.
3147960	3149720	I think he thinks he failed him.
3149720	3151520	Yeah, but why didn't he just say fail?
3151520	3155200	Because he was, you know, obviously a very dark place.
3155200	3157400	And he didn't betray Anshun.
3157400	3158680	Like the...
3158680	3162120	But to someone that doesn't know my father,
3162160	3164520	there's no situation to read this and says betrayed.
3164520	3166640	Oh, clearly, Bill is hiding something.
3166640	3168280	Clearly, David's not writing something.
3168280	3171000	Clearly, Val is holding back something he found in the emails
3171000	3172520	because there's word betrayal in there.
3172520	3175200	By the time I paid 281,
3175200	3176680	Did you get my point?
3176680	3178000	Yes, I understand.
3178000	3181120	How strong that word can be missed.
3181120	3183320	Well, but it's not my word.
3183320	3188320	I know, but how, to a novice reader of this story,
3188760	3191280	in this book, to just see that word and have that pop out,
3191360	3192720	such a loaded word,
3192720	3195680	that they can easily conspiracy theories arise.
3195680	3197840	Val and David are leaving out something very important
3197840	3198680	that Bill's guilty of.
3198680	3200760	Why would he kill himself?
3200760	3202320	Clearly, he did something wrong.
3202320	3203960	Do you know, it's like the fallacy of saying,
3203960	3205880	well, why is Val's mom treating him like this?
3205880	3207520	Clearly, Val did something wrong.
3207520	3208360	You know?
3208360	3212640	The fallacy of, you know, do you get my point?
3212640	3217640	Yeah, except that this is page 281 of a book
3217680	3222680	that has your dad's rise and fall
3223040	3225640	as one of its central narrative backbones.
3225640	3228160	And I do not think anyone can be taking anything out of context
3228160	3229000	to this one in the book.
3229000	3232000	I just wanted to let you see what your thoughts are on that.
3232000	3233920	And express my thoughts.
3233920	3238400	You know, it's a risk in my head, it's a risk.
3238400	3240560	Well, but I'm trying to manage.
3240560	3241400	Yeah, I hear you.
3241400	3243120	But I mean, to me, like,
3243560	3248440	I'm not bothered by that risk.
3248440	3253440	I think the risk is there's no way to ignore what he wrote.
3253760	3255440	And you put it in a lot of context
3255440	3256560	and it belongs a lot.
3256560	3259240	But you could add an opposing viewpoint.
3259240	3260080	What's the opposing viewpoint?
3260080	3261920	What I just told you.
3261920	3263160	No one's suggesting he betrayed him.
3263160	3265880	There's, I think in his head,
3265880	3268320	he probably felt like he had failed, though.
3268320	3269440	That makes more sense.
3269440	3270960	But he didn't use the word fail.
3270960	3274280	Well, he used the word carelessness.
3274280	3275120	Yeah.
3275120	3275960	And it.
3275960	3278600	That leads to failure, I guess.
3278600	3279440	Okay.
3279440	3281240	So let's see.
3284960	3286800	Am I going to Europe?
3286800	3287920	Is that what's next?
3287920	3288760	So what's next?
3288760	3290120	Let's go to Europe.
3290120	3291000	Off you go.
3291000	3291840	Okay.
3291840	3293600	So you decided to go to Europe
3293600	3295440	a little bit after the second anniversary of your death.
3295440	3297600	Are you going over the post thing?
3298520	3299360	No.
3299360	3302400	I'm mentioning, that's a good question, actually.
3302400	3306680	Let me, we'll get there in two minutes.
3306680	3307520	Okay.
3307520	3308960	So you decided to go to Europe
3310480	3312520	a little bit after the second anniversary of your death.
3312520	3315320	So that's in early 2016.
3317000	3318320	It's March, probably.
3318320	3319160	Yeah.
3322080	3326240	I'm noting that, and maybe this is wrong, actually,
3326240	3327240	and I should fix this.
3327240	3329320	But there is, at least the way it seemed to me
3329320	3332440	and previous, our infinite conversations
3332440	3333760	we've had about this.
3333760	3336080	By this point, it seemed a bit clearer to you
3338080	3340520	that your dad clearly had committed suicide,
3340520	3345520	at least in part, because of fear and concern
3345720	3348840	and shame about what had happened at the back.
3348840	3350440	No, not yet.
3350440	3351280	Not yet.
3351280	3353440	This is a good thing you brought up.
3353440	3356360	Because at this point, that's why I said,
3356360	3357280	I'm going to go over the post part,
3357280	3360600	because this is when Michael Gray comes in
3360600	3364400	and plants it in my head that my dad was murdered.
3364400	3366000	He puts this into my head,
3366000	3367920	which I already kind of thought,
3367920	3370200	he was toying with this idea that he was forced
3370200	3373120	to kill himself or suicide by extortion.
3373120	3375760	Like, if you don't kill yourself, we're gonna,
3375760	3377240	the Hollywood version.
3377240	3378520	In fact, the next paragraph here,
3378520	3379800	we got into Michael Gray, so.
3379800	3383200	Yeah, and when that seed was planted in my head,
3383200	3386600	I went to, I wanted to meet David Rossi,
3386600	3388840	when I learned the whole David Rossi story.
3388840	3390240	But did you think at that point,
3390240	3392680	that in a literally like way?
3392680	3394360	I didn't want to believe that my dad killed himself.
3394360	3396360	I did not want to believe that at all.
3397720	3399560	And that's, tell me why.
3399560	3404360	I just, it just didn't fit in my understanding of my father.
3404360	3406720	It just didn't fit in anyone's understanding of him.
3406720	3407560	As you can guess.
3407560	3408740	Yeah, that's definitely true.
3408740	3411320	So there's, in congruency there,
3411360	3413280	I wanted to figure out what was wrong.
3413280	3417280	And what was, maybe I have to examine all possibilities.
3417280	3420560	And one of those possibilities is that it was
3420560	3424000	some sort of shady mafia shit with Monty Duposky.
3424000	3426080	And that's what Michael Gray planted in my head.
3426080	3427080	And I ran with it.
3427080	3429600	And I really took it to the end of its,
3429600	3432160	I took it as far as I could go until I realized
3432160	3434320	that that was ridiculous.
3434320	3435760	But I had to examine it.
3435760	3436600	No, I understand.
3436600	3438000	And this is actually, in fact,
3438000	3439680	basically the way I've written it.
3439720	3441520	There's no indication of foul playing Bill's death,
3441520	3443560	but after watching the Italian video,
3443560	3444520	you couldn't help but wonder
3444520	3446680	whether I'm going to uncover, et cetera, et cetera.
3446680	3450160	So one thing I need to run by here or tell you
3450160	3453360	is that I've got a footnote here.
3453360	3454640	There aren't many footnotes in this book,
3454640	3456360	but there's one right here.
3456360	3460240	Which I say, exercising awful judgment,
3460240	3462160	you shared with Michael Gray,
3462160	3464000	one of the photos you've shown,
3464000	3466320	or you've taken of your dad lying in the hallway.
3466320	3469200	And I say that exhibiting even worse taste,
3469200	3471400	the post then published that photo.
3471400	3472720	And I'm saying that your family-
3472720	3475400	I was saying the emails where I was upset about that.
3475400	3476240	And I'm saying-
3476240	3477600	The emails I said to Michael Gray,
3477600	3479480	like, why did you do this to take it out?
3479480	3480560	And they said it was too late
3480560	3481400	because it's already-
3481400	3482640	Well, they did edit it, ultimately.
3482640	3483480	But there-
3483480	3484320	They did.
3484320	3485160	Ultimately, yeah, it's not like that.
3485160	3486320	I haven't even looked.
3486320	3487160	Yeah, it's gone.
3487160	3488000	I mean-
3488000	3488840	That's great.
3488840	3491000	But in his, I mean, there is not much defense room.
3491000	3492560	Like, you should not have published those photos,
3492560	3493400	I don't think.
3493400	3496440	But on the other hand, yeah, you like did,
3496440	3498080	he's a journalist and you gave it to him, so.
3498080	3499680	You should have asked me.
3499680	3501440	Well, whatever, it doesn't matter.
3501440	3502280	There is-
3502280	3503120	No, it doesn't matter.
3503120	3504520	I said, can I use this photo in the production?
3504520	3507440	I said, yes or no, you know, you should have asked me.
3509160	3511480	I'm noting that your family suspected
3511480	3513400	you had sold the photo to the post,
3513400	3514960	which was not the case,
3514960	3516360	and they never forgave you for that.
3516360	3518960	No, for something, never forgave you
3518960	3520680	for something that never happened.
3520680	3522240	Well, you did share it with the post.
3522240	3523080	Yes, I did share it.
3523080	3526200	Which was not in my, I don't think,
3526200	3527600	you've not, this is a stupid move.
3527600	3528440	It was stupid, yeah.
3528440	3529280	Yeah, shit, yeah.
3529280	3530200	Just wanted to know what it would be,
3530200	3531040	what we want to be at the scene,
3531040	3531880	what it would look like.
3531880	3532920	And then I thought, you know,
3532920	3534720	they could have gotten it from the police anyway,
3534720	3536240	it's like handed everything over to them,
3536240	3538880	so why not save them some fucking time?
3540480	3543840	It's not like they couldn't get it in my head,
3543840	3545600	so I thought, I don't know.
3545600	3546440	Okay.
3546440	3547960	It was, yes, but yes, it was a terrible move,
3547960	3550000	and it's fine to put that in there.
3550000	3550840	Okay.
3553320	3556160	Okay, so you, maybe you've already done this,
3556160	3558320	but you go into your mom's email,
3558320	3560960	you find the details for AMX.
3560960	3561800	And...
3561800	3564440	I think also, if I could just go back for a minute,
3564440	3565800	instead of just a footnote saying
3565800	3568000	it was a ridiculously terrible move,
3568000	3571960	can you explain that it became a huge
3571960	3574320	incident between the family?
3574320	3575160	Yeah, no, I say that.
3575160	3577880	I say, Val family suspected that he had sold
3577880	3580240	the photo to the post, which was not the case,
3580240	3581680	and they never forgave him.
3581680	3584640	Okay, I mean, you think it's only worth a footnote?
3584640	3585720	Yeah, I do.
3586160	3587000	Um...
3592080	3594760	Okay, so you get your mom's AMX number,
3594760	3596840	you buy a bunch of new computer equipment
3596840	3597880	for the trip to Europe,
3598960	3603360	you load all this stuff onto one of the new laptops,
3603360	3604840	you get a business class ticket to Paris,
3604840	3606440	and you fly in March of 2016.
3607320	3609360	You land at Charles de Gaulle,
3609360	3612920	and things immediately go off course.
3612920	3614360	You're in the bathroom,
3614360	3616480	briefly to snort a few lines of coke,
3616480	3618600	and you leave your bags unattended.
3618600	3619440	Yeah.
3619440	3620880	And when you come out,
3620880	3623280	a bunch of the new computer stuff is gone.
3623280	3625000	The laptop with all the stuff on it.
3625000	3629440	I'd go, and it was snorting heroin, not coke, but...
3629440	3630280	That's good.
3630280	3631120	Let me...
3631120	3631960	That somehow fits right now.
3631960	3634160	Yeah, and I was doing that on the flight, too.
3636240	3639520	And I had gone to the bathroom,
3639520	3641480	yes, but I did not leave my bags unattended.
3641480	3643520	I had them all in that silly little push cart
3643520	3645560	they have brought into the bathroom with me.
3645560	3648120	I specifically chose one of those big disabled bathrooms,
3648120	3649640	so I could put it all in there.
3649640	3653080	Took it all back out, everything was in my line of sight,
3653080	3654760	and I go to buy a SIM card,
3654760	3656280	and it's the only time I could not take it
3656280	3657520	into the kiosk area.
3657520	3659480	I had to leave it next to the cashier.
3659480	3660320	Got it, okay.
3660320	3661680	That's when I would have lost my line of sight
3661680	3662880	for just a few minutes.
3662880	3663960	Yeah, okay.
3663960	3665720	So computer equipment gets stolen,
3665720	3668560	except for the laptop with all the stuff
3668560	3671800	you'd got taken from your dad's files.
3671800	3673960	There were two iParents,
3673960	3677760	and two possibly,
3677760	3679120	whatever it was in the police car, I can't remember,
3679120	3681160	it was two hard drives, the big G drives,
3681160	3683360	like those two terabytes worth.
3684480	3687160	Two of those are gone, and the iPads are missing.
3687160	3688000	Yeah, okay.
3688000	3689800	And the backpacks I had on my,
3689800	3692520	I was wearing them so they couldn't have taken those.
3692520	3693360	Okay.
3694560	3696680	Nothing else was taken, no passport,
3696680	3699000	everything else was, nothing else was stolen,
3699000	3700600	but those specific drives.
3702120	3705440	Okay, you called Larry Meltzer from the airport,
3705440	3707280	told him what had happened.
3707280	3709960	I called him at the hotel, but not at the airport.
3709960	3710960	You sure about that?
3711960	3714200	I'm pretty sure you called him from the airport.
3714200	3715400	Did I call him from the airport?
3715400	3716240	I may have.
3716240	3718280	If he says I did, I probably didn't.
3718280	3720880	Okay, so he told you.
3720880	3722240	I called him many times, I just can't remember.
3722240	3727240	Yeah, he told you that it was possible
3727760	3728880	that you were being followed,
3728920	3731040	perhaps at least I'm from Deutsche,
3731040	3734280	and he just warned you to be careful.
3734280	3735120	Yeah.
3735120	3737760	So you then rent an Audi from Avis?
3737760	3741320	No, Nissan Cascua, Cascai.
3743400	3744240	Really?
3744240	3745080	Yeah, yeah.
3745080	3745920	What did he?
3745920	3746760	It's a bit later.
3746760	3750440	I spent about three weeks detoxing off the heroin.
3750440	3752120	Unfortunately, in France, there's a lot of coding
3752120	3754000	over the counter, so that was very helpful.
3754000	3755440	But when you drive to Amsterdam,
3755440	3757440	you drive an Audi from Avis?
3757440	3758720	No, no, no, no.
3758720	3761880	When I drive to Amsterdam, I drive a Nissan Cascai.
3761880	3762720	You sure?
3762720	3765360	That's what, in Amsterdam, your car gets smashed.
3765360	3767760	Yeah, that's the Cascai, the Cascai.
3767760	3769280	Are you 100% certain about that?
3769280	3770800	Because you showed me a photo of this.
3770800	3771800	Yeah, I'm 100% certain.
3771800	3774920	I'm saying this, but it looks like an Audi, but it's not.
3774920	3776200	Okay, so what is it?
3776200	3779400	It's a Nissan QUA.
3779400	3780240	I don't care.
3780240	3781080	I'll just say Nissan.
3781080	3781920	QUAI.
3781920	3783120	Okay, Nissan.
3783120	3784320	I'll share the photos.
3789120	3791960	Okay, so one evening, someone smashes the car's window,
3791960	3794480	steals the remaining laptop,
3794480	3796640	which was hidden under the passenger seat,
3796640	3798760	and yet your wallet, password, guitar,
3798760	3800760	which were all in plain view weren't stolen.
3800760	3801600	This is in Amsterdam.
3801600	3802440	Yes.
3802440	3803280	Yeah.
3803280	3804600	And that's it for you.
3804600	3808000	You concluded at this point, and as does Larry Meltzer,
3808000	3811480	that there's a conspiracy afoot.
3811480	3813480	A conspiracy afoot.
3813480	3816840	And, you know, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to
3817800	3821800	And Meltzer is further convinced of this
3821800	3823960	because he, at one time when you're talking,
3823960	3826200	hears some odd clicking sounds on the line,
3826200	3828440	and another time you call him,
3828440	3830560	but end up getting connected to his wife's cell phone.
3830560	3831400	Very weird.
3831400	3833240	Yeah.
3833240	3834640	And then not only that, I mean,
3834640	3837120	computers would turn off restart on their own.
3837120	3840040	The phones would turn off restart on their own.
3840040	3841200	Very strange things happen.
3841200	3844120	Very odd buggy behavior.
3844120	3845320	We're both convinced.
3845320	3847680	Well, he convinced me that I was being hacked.
3850320	3851760	I didn't want to believe it, because I had,
3851760	3854280	remember, I had just been through this terrible experience
3854280	3856120	of paranoia and delusion.
3856120	3859040	I did not want to ever go back there again.
3859040	3861400	So any hint of you're being followed was like,
3861400	3862800	I don't want to believe this.
3862800	3864040	I'm not being followed.
3864040	3865400	I'm perfectly normal.
3865400	3866880	Everything's normal, you know?
3866880	3868600	And Larry had to keep beating it into me
3868600	3870640	that be careful, be careful, be careful.
3870640	3871480	Yeah.
3871480	3873120	I mean, some people might argue that that is not
3873120	3874640	the most constructive rule for a therapist,
3875120	3876720	I know, I know, I know.
3876720	3878280	It's funny that the therapist is telling me
3878280	3879520	to be more paranoid.
3879520	3881880	Yes, funny is the word for it.
3881880	3883440	It's ironic, ironic.
3883440	3887880	Okay, so you check into a suite in the Steigenberger,
3887880	3889800	Airbird of Tallinn, Amsterdam.
3889800	3894080	Wait, but what about the whole time in the Camping
3894080	3894920	of Ligambos?
3894920	3895760	That was a whole...
3895760	3897440	No, that's afterwards.
3897440	3899360	No, no, no, no, no.
3900240	3903480	I check into, I can see it in my head.
3903520	3904760	This is the campground you're talking about?
3904760	3908200	Yes, before the campground, I check into
3908200	3911280	the Hotel New Hampshire, New Hampshire Hotels
3911280	3912880	right in Rembrandt Square.
3914040	3916880	Tell them the name of it if I can find it for you.
3916880	3921880	And I stay there for about 12-ish days
3922120	3925000	before I'm going to go to Siena.
3925000	3926800	And we also passed up to me trying to get back
3926800	3928320	into the country, back into England.
3928320	3929320	Yeah, I don't care about that.
3929320	3930160	Okay.
3931240	3932240	Now, are you sure about this
3932280	3933480	because I've looked at the receipts
3933480	3934880	from the airport hotel.
3934880	3936040	Yeah, no, I definitely stayed there,
3936040	3941040	but that was after the Camping of Ligambos.
3944120	3946640	It was a Hampshire hotel in Rembrandt Square.
3946640	3947840	I'm going to call it Hotel New Hampshire,
3947840	3949960	but it's not, that's a book by John Irving.
3949960	3953720	It was something, something, and it had a nice suite.
3953720	3955320	Don't worry about, what are you doing right now, by the way?
3955320	3957560	I'm trying to find the photo of the car,
3957560	3960200	of the Nissan Cache Quarry.
3960200	3963920	And I'll show you the picture of the hotel as well,
3963920	3967000	the actual name of the hotel in Amsterdam.
3967000	3969560	Okay, so you stay at another hotel in Amsterdam.
3969560	3970400	Yes.
3970400	3971640	Then, using your mom's AmEx,
3971640	3976640	and then you, she or her guy figures out
3977880	3979360	that there's theft going on.
3979360	3980520	Not yet.
3980520	3982000	Why do you end up at the campground then?
3982000	3983440	So I'm at the campground.
3983440	3984280	No, no, no, no.
3984280	3985160	You're in a hotel.
3985160	3986000	Yeah.
3986000	3987520	Why do you go from a hotel to a campground?
3987520	3991320	So I met this lady in a bar in Amsterdam,
3991320	3993680	and she said, you got to come to this place
3993680	3996800	called Fliegenboos, where there's like a hippie dream.
3996800	3998480	You know, everyone's jamming all the time,
3998480	4000480	and people from all over the world are here,
4000480	4003400	and it's just like the coolest place in Amsterdam.
4003400	4005320	And come on Saturday night, especially,
4005320	4006760	you know, I want you to come play with us.
4006760	4007840	You brought your guitars, you know,
4007840	4010520	come jam and play a show here.
4010520	4012160	And I'm like, okay, fine, why not?
4012160	4013760	You know, I haven't played music in a while.
4013760	4016840	It'll be good to meet some, some cool people in Amsterdam,
4017600	4018440	and go.
4018440	4020120	So I drive down there,
4021400	4023880	and it turns out it was not the hippie dream she mentioned.
4023880	4026520	She just was running this music show,
4026520	4028040	this music night at the place,
4028040	4029800	and just wanted me to play for free.
4029800	4030640	So I was like, okay, fine.
4030640	4033240	So when I played, I rented a cabin,
4033240	4035600	and I stayed there for two nights,
4035600	4038200	and the night before I was going to leave,
4038200	4040400	I think it was a Sunday,
4040400	4043360	I go into Amsterdam, into Thalstra,
4043360	4046400	to go buy some cigarettes in the center of Amsterdam.
4046400	4049760	I leave the car in a cobblestone fucking street
4049760	4050760	to go buy cigarettes.
4050760	4053320	I've gone for five fucking minutes.
4053320	4054880	I get back into the car,
4054880	4057480	I get back toward the car, I see the strewn glass,
4057480	4058640	and I'm like, oh shit,
4058640	4060000	somebody's car just got broken into,
4060000	4061800	I feel terrible over it.
4061800	4063120	This happened too.
4063120	4066560	I get closer to my car, and underneath the fucking lamp,
4066560	4069360	you know, there's just windows gone smashed.
4069360	4071360	I'm like, fuck it's me, you know?
4071360	4073640	I go in, I check to see what's missing.
4073640	4076040	Only thing that's missing is the black laptop.
4076320	4079720	Just exactly like this, I use this exact same cover.
4079720	4081360	In the darkness of night,
4081360	4082960	under cover of the fucking night,
4082960	4085200	in Amsterdam, under one streetlight,
4085200	4087760	underneath the passenger side seat,
4087760	4089720	you had to know where it was.
4089720	4094640	My passport, right here, right here,
4094640	4095760	nothing else was taken.
4095760	4098360	Guitars, in the back, my strat, in the back,
4098360	4099640	all my luggage, in the back.
4099640	4100480	I'm just starting to lose it.
4100480	4102120	Can we just focus on the chronology for a second though?
4102120	4104840	There's, okay, so you're at this New Hampshire hotel,
4104840	4105960	whatever it's called.
4105960	4108680	You then go and spend a couple nights at the campground,
4108680	4110200	then your car that's broken into,
4110200	4112760	and they steal the laptop, and then what?
4112760	4116520	And then, I file a police report,
4116520	4119520	I go to the Amsterdam police,
4119520	4122120	we call Avis, tell them what happened.
4122120	4124520	They said they're gonna send a tow truck the next day
4124520	4126200	and swap out cars for me, you know,
4126200	4127720	don't worry about it, et cetera, et cetera.
4127720	4129560	You might have to pay a little bit for the window,
4129560	4131240	whatever you're based on your insurance.
4131240	4134480	I'm like, great, I got full insurance, you know?
4134520	4136920	At least I thought I did, I turned out I didn't.
4136920	4141120	I go back to the campground, I sleep, I wake up,
4141120	4143320	I go to check out with my card,
4143320	4146360	and the, I can't remember his name anymore,
4146360	4147640	but the guy's like, your card's not working,
4147640	4148480	I was like, what do you mean it's not working,
4148480	4149840	it's not working, so your card's not working.
4149840	4152720	So I call the bank, and I look at the app,
4152720	4154360	sorry, I didn't call the bank, I look at the app,
4154360	4157040	and I'm negative $15,000.
4157040	4157880	It's like, what the fuck?
4157880	4162200	And it's from Avis, I fetch Avis, and so then I'm stuck.
4162200	4163920	And so then you just stay at the campground
4163960	4165120	for a while, and I just stay at the campground.
4165120	4166560	Okay.
4166560	4168920	There were, yes, the reason I couldn't get out,
4168920	4170080	because I could not.
4170080	4172280	Wait, so then were you using your mom's credit card,
4172280	4173360	or was that another credit card?
4173360	4175000	I was using, no, for the,
4175000	4177000	Vleganbos was not very expensive,
4177000	4178640	so I could use my card for that.
4178640	4180120	But what about for Avis?
4180120	4182680	For Avis, I used my mom's card,
4182680	4186120	but I paid with my, I used my mom's card as the,
4186120	4188240	because you can't do it with a debit card in that country,
4188240	4190520	but I can use the credit card number
4190520	4191680	and put it on my card,
4191720	4194720	because it could not charge remotely only on digits.
4194720	4197000	I had to show up with an actual thing,
4197000	4200560	but on the reservation online, you can use just digits,
4200560	4203440	but you have to show up with a proper car
4203440	4205280	that they can take money from in person.
4205280	4207320	So they couldn't take money off my mom's card,
4207320	4208720	they can only take it off my card.
4208720	4211880	So I used it to establish that there is credit,
4211880	4212920	and that if anything happens,
4212920	4215160	you can go to this credit card company.
4215160	4219560	That's the way they did it in fucking Avis Charles DeGaulle.
4219560	4220440	Do you understand what I mean?
4220480	4221320	Yes.
4221320	4223800	What I'm confused about a little bit is-
4223800	4225120	And I had to use my money,
4225120	4226400	otherwise I would have got a much better card.
4226400	4228360	At the Hampshire Hotel,
4228360	4233360	you are staying on for 12 nights on your mom's card.
4234920	4235760	Yes.
4235760	4236600	Okay.
4236600	4241000	So why once your bank account gets drained by Avis,
4241000	4242400	why don't you just go somewhere else
4242400	4243600	and put it on your mom's card?
4243600	4246440	Because that, yeah, that card, I couldn't use it.
4246440	4247520	I couldn't use that anymore.
4247520	4248640	Because your mom had figured it out.
4248640	4251040	She had canceled that card, yeah.
4251040	4253080	That specific card, and I hadn't gone back
4253080	4254400	to the emails to find other cards.
4254400	4256600	Right, and she had figured out, okay.
4256600	4257440	And I did try.
4257440	4260640	So what I've gotten wrong here is not,
4260640	4263240	it's really just that I got wrong in the name of the hotel.
4263240	4264080	Right.
4264080	4265880	So, okay.
4265880	4267360	And the Audi.
4267360	4268200	Yeah, and the Audi.
4268200	4269040	Yeah, and the Audi.
4269040	4271280	Believe me, if I could have used my mom's card,
4271280	4273560	I would have gotten a much nicer car.
4273560	4275600	Okay, I'm quoting you saying
4275600	4278800	that you didn't feel guilty stealing from her.
4278800	4279720	Not at all.
4279720	4281000	And I'm quoting you saying,
4281000	4282440	this is the only way I can get at her.
4282440	4283760	This is the only jab I can take at her.
4283760	4286160	Yeah, but that's just, you know, that's silly.
4286160	4288600	I mean, again, like I told you outside,
4288600	4290680	I have no home.
4290680	4293040	I'm living in rental cars in hotels.
4293040	4295400	And so I really have no sympathy for her
4295400	4297680	to take her money, to stay alive and eat.
4299400	4300240	Good.
4300240	4302280	No sympathy, to have shelter and eat.
4302280	4305200	And yes, you know, I didn't get the basics.
4305200	4307840	I didn't go to a shitty fucking roadway in.
4307840	4309160	I went to the best hotels I could.
4309160	4310000	So fuck her out.
4310000	4312520	Just, it'd be nice to have some little bit of luxury
4312520	4315680	for that I missed for a very long time.
4315680	4317040	You know, why not?
4317040	4318200	And it wasn't a fuck you.
4318200	4319520	It wasn't like, oh, I'm gonna,
4319520	4320520	this is my fuck you to her.
4320520	4322440	This is me staying alive and surviving
4322440	4323280	and get through this trip.
4323280	4324720	So I can get to fucking Sienna
4324720	4326720	and find out what's going on with David Rossi.
4326720	4327560	Okay.
4327560	4329680	And get to UBS and find and meet Sergio Armani.
4329680	4330760	That was the other part of the thing.
4330760	4331640	But that happened later.
4331640	4333120	Yes, indeed.
4333120	4334920	Okay, so at the campground, you mean?
4335800	4338000	I would take out, this is my only way of getting back.
4338000	4339400	Maybe yes, that's part of it.
4339400	4340240	There was some anger there,
4340240	4341360	but that wasn't the basic need.
4341360	4344040	The basic need was to eat and have shelter.
4344040	4344880	I hear you.
4346760	4348480	But you're not clicky clacky, you know.
4348480	4350240	Because we're recording this.
4350240	4351920	There's, and also I'm not guaranteeing
4351920	4352760	I'm taking stuff out.
4352760	4355040	So there's, but I definitely hear what you're saying.
4355040	4357600	And I will, I'm gonna, lucky me,
4357600	4359840	I'm gonna get to spend, you know,
4359840	4363000	how many, we're probably about seven hours now total.
4363000	4364640	I'm gonna get to go through this all again.
4365560	4370200	Relive this minus the cigarette smoke.
4370200	4373200	So minus like the fucking lung cancer you're giving me.
4373200	4375640	I got the fan blowing and went into the door's open.
4375640	4376480	Disgusting.
4380400	4381240	Okay, so.
4381240	4383040	David, prove what, David.
4383040	4383880	Yeah, exactly.
4383880	4385040	He sound like my wife.
4386800	4388120	It's a best piece.
4388120	4389960	Jesus, David.
4389960	4390960	The Marie keeps telling me,
4390960	4392440	it's like, David's like your ex-wife.
4392440	4393280	He's like a wife.
4393280	4394280	My ex-wife?
4394320	4395680	No, David's like your wife.
4395680	4396520	Sorry.
4397960	4399160	Did you talk to David again today?
4399160	4400000	Who are you talking to?
4400000	4400820	Is it David?
4400820	4403360	Kirsten gets sometimes,
4403360	4406400	is both with you and with Tom Hayes.
4406400	4409520	She like thinks, or has thought that,
4409520	4410720	I don't think she's actually thought this,
4410720	4412920	but I think it's like occurred to her at points
4412920	4415400	that maybe I have a lover.
4416400	4418280	Is this valve really a man?
4418280	4419120	Is it male valve?
4419120	4419960	Yeah, I don't.
4419960	4421480	That's why she called,
4421480	4422520	or she was on the phone the other night.
4422520	4425640	No, I think she just like finds you fascinating actually.
4425640	4427440	And she read the story, right?
4427440	4428280	What story?
4428280	4429120	She read your book.
4429120	4431640	Yeah, she's read it, but also she's just like,
4431640	4434520	you know, lived this with me for the past,
4434520	4435800	what, five years, so.
4435800	4437360	She is.
4437360	4438200	I mean, it's more so.
4438200	4439040	Do I anything?
4439040	4439880	No, not at all.
4439880	4440720	Yeah, I'll get some water.
4440720	4442520	I'll pause this for a second, please.
4442520	4443360	Bring it up.
4445360	4446200	I think it's important.
4446200	4447040	Oh, shit, dude.
4447040	4448880	That's not an exposure.
4448880	4451240	Oh my God, it's stop recording.
4451240	4452080	What?
4452760	4453840	Okay.
4453840	4455560	No, like for a while, yeah.
4455560	4456600	I just wanted to reiterate,
4456600	4457560	I just think it's a,
4457560	4459600	oh, you didn't record that last minute.
4459600	4461760	Oh, yeah, I can understand you.
4461760	4463600	No, I don't think it's.
4463600	4465600	No, that's not gonna happen.
4473600	4475600	You don't see this thing.
4475600	4476880	All you have to do is to spend some time
4476880	4478240	and you should look at it as opposed to
4478240	4481080	what's not to be seen as many after you.
4481080	4482220	You have to do that.
4485020	4486740	You should have.
4490240	4493040	You should have, that's funny.
