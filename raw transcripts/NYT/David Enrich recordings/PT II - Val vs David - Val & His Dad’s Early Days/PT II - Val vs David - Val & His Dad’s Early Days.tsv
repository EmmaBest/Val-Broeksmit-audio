start	end	text
0	8560	going okay great okay so we were just getting into your parent your arrival in
8560	15840	the United States and so 1982 Ola and Alexander get divorced yeah you go to
15840	23880	live with your dad yeah and then I go through some of the frankly like awful
23880	29400	memories you have so we've got you him your dad taking you to a horror movie and
29400	33920	you were so scared to be puked in the aisle Halloween what was hell oh that
33920	41560	was the movie okay we've got your dad collapsing on the floor yeah frothing at
41560	48600	the mouth like what the fuck was it and then we've got you guys ending up in
48600	54880	the selection army homeless shelter and it which we've found together in those
54880	61640	documents you got from Cook County and it one hot day in May of 1982 the juvenile
61640	65960	court takes custody and it you know I'm just quoting from the court filing
65960	69440	saying that you're neglected and that the miners parent does not provide the care
69440	73440	necessary for the miners while being citing the mental and or physical
73440	79440	disability of the parent noting that the court tried to track down your mom even
79440	83920	running a newspaper ad in Chicago Sun-Times unsuccessfully and it turned
83960	87520	out that she was staying in her mother's apartment which is just like a few miles
87520	98760	away and so off you go into foster care which is like I'm not just doing this
98760	105400	with a camera but it's that like on the scale of the pain associated with your
105400	110440	dad's death which is worse like how does that come how does that these memories
110440	117960	compare to that memory I mean well these memories are few and far between but
117960	125400	they're not pleasant yeah I can't even imagine
126360	134960	okay so now we switch back a bit to Bill's narrative and it he goes to
134960	140120	Northwestern he goes to business school Northwestern did you exempt all this
140120	147560	speculation about my mom yes okay should we say it for fun it's not necessary
147560	151320	um man that fun
154400	159720	okay so he gets a job that by the way was that shank I'm not since I'm not using
159720	164520	that one good it was it was like one of the people that was in his circle at the
164520	168480	time college friends I can't remember if the guy went to college I remember it was
168480	172140	just in that circle okay I mean he said it on the record but I'm just since we're
172140	182040	not you said it on the right yet was it verified by anyone else no okay um let's
182040	187080	see okay so he graduated from business school gets a job of continental Illinois
187080	191080	which is one of the biggest banks in the country at the time and this is where he
191120	195240	really gets in derivatives and it's a blah blah blah I spent with derivatives are
195240	205360	81 this is let's see what year is this yeah this is 81 or 82 and so this time
205360	213320	derivatives were pretty much a sleepy tool used by a few banks by this it was it
213320	219520	was like becoming a kind of an expanding lucrative niche for lots of banks like
219560	224160	mortgages no it was well they were starting to one of your dad's
224160	227120	innovations and I'll look kind of getting out of order here and that's fine
227120	233320	okay was well let's just wait actually I'll go through it and of it so one day
233320	239840	your dad it's actually a little unclear exactly where your parents met but
239840	245480	there's the leading theory that I've heard it's a party what was that I can
245480	249000	always know the story of the party what I've heard from more people is that he
249040	254000	went into the Stanley Corsac store for some reason and met her I think this is
254000	259280	after this party maybe that's the way I remember the story you see you remember
259280	264280	the story being that they met like at a mutual friend's party yeah okay and then
264280	268480	you went to see her at the store a few times oh that's interesting so okay well
268480	278120	in any case the they became a couple they got engaged in 1983 and in March of
278120	286400	1984 Reverend Jack officiated their wedding so we go through some more of
286400	292160	your like not very pleasant foster care memories here which we don't need to do
292160	295480	unless you want to which ones I want to okay sure I'm happy to if you want to
295480	300360	sure okay so and we talked about this a little bit yesterday there's this
300360	305160	wonderful photo of you and your dad together in the I guess in the social
305160	310600	workers place and you know you seated together on the carpet and there's a
310600	317200	game and I just physically describe you guys and there's like a big pile the
317200	321040	brown leather jacket on an orange sofa and a small pile of black and white
321040	323880	photos that I guess you guys were looking at together maybe back from your
323880	332680	time in Ukraine but a picture of him on a it's really tank right he sent that to
332680	336880	you didn't wasn't that was after he disappeared that wasn't I think so yeah
336880	343240	I mean my memory is foggy yeah yeah and then he had sent me a photo of him on a
343240	350000	tank and a toy tank and a canteen Israeli canteen like a army canteen right but
350000	365160	that was after he disappeared I think so so there's another very painful memory
365160	369200	about you're in the basement of the social workers office with a bunch of
369200	373560	other kids you're bickering over the rules of connect for yes the door at the
373560	381180	top of the stairs opens all the kids stop what they're doing someone's name is
381180	384560	gonna get called and that means their parents are there for a visit and you're
384560	389760	not just a visit to take yeah your your name gets called you run up the stairs
389760	395600	your mom's gonna be there maybe she's gonna take you home and it's not your
395600	401200	mom it's Helen the social worker and she's there to inform me that you're
401200	405920	being assigned to a new family did you talk to her no I didn't I don't even know
405920	409280	she's still alive yeah this is a long time ago
409280	415160	I remember her she was in very nice it's kind of short long blonde hair nice voice
415160	420000	Midwestern very kind person
420000	431760	okay and she would take me from one home to the other whenever leave one she'd
431760	435900	always take me and drive me I remember always stopping McDonald's cuz I love
435900	441720	McDonald's he doesn't love McDonald's at that age every kid yeah yes she was very
441720	447040	nice get some more water but yeah go on sorry okay so we kind of shift gears a
447040	455120	little bit here for a while that stuff's not related to you guys so in
455120	469440	early 1984 Edson hires Bill at Merrill and yeah which is right as continental
469440	474520	Illinois is about to collapse so it's fortuitous time so he was poached yeah
474520	482080	he was hot Edson hired that's an idea so how did Edson meet him they that's a
482080	485400	little unclear actually how they met they were both working in Chicago banking
485400	495760	for a while they're both at Connell no Edson was at Bank of America okay anyway
495760	504560	your parents moved to Short Hills so it doesn't want to know about two pots are
504560	508400	sick I know it's okay just to give her a quick text I'm just we can just keep it
508400	513720	rolling okay um don't make you go on yeah she says a casual pizza place or
513720	518560	something more upscale like manual at LA what do you do mine I mean what do you
518560	525600	want to do is it nice yeah they're paying and let's it's unhappiness ours by
525600	538320	house in words yeah yeah is it would be open run seven
539080	559440	no oh yeah yeah she's gonna do it yeah great okay okay it sounds fine so I'm
559440	567680	accustomed to dealing with no I did I want to meet him but yeah get rid of
567680	586960	him I'm curious to meet him okay wait there wait hang on hang on they're gonna
586960	590640	pay for this I don't know they haven't said we're paying so should I just say are
590640	595640	you paying yeah yeah say if you're paying that sounds great with like a
595640	606520	smiley okay yeah I'm assuming you're paying smiley yeah or Roseanne is
606520	617440	depends he's paying I'm not coming from oh I see that's when he takes me to a
617440	621680	restaurant it's always like Donald well we're just talking about the reality is
621680	630360	always looking down smiley face sounds great depends he's paying exclamation
630520	637520	smiley face sometimes just a lot easier to write smiley face than to actually go
637520	643600	find the emoji for smiley face David I are working right now I'll just let her
643600	650840	know I'll just stay she's okay all right let's keep going here okay so shortly
650840	656400	after they arrive in Short Hills they decide that they want you yeah and it
656400	662880	takes a while but by Thanksgiving of 1985 all is granted custody of you you're
662880	667920	nine years old by this time I thought that was 1984 it's 1985 she initiated
667920	674760	proceeding in 1984 but it was not until 1985 that she got you back those fall of
674760	684120	85 yes Thanksgiving and it so I'll look at some counseling at the request of
684120	690640	Jersey social services and it gets the family you guys get a caseworker who
690640	696960	comes and visits and the caseworker notes that you have lots of toys in a
696960	702120	very nice bedroom and what you want you tend to get and that you're having it's
702120	706200	caseworker said what I want to get not in those words but yeah that you get lots
706200	711400	of material possessions however you're having it's taking a while for you to
711400	716440	get like to open up emotionally to your parents understandably you're starting to
716440	719960	give hugs and kisses but you're also insisting on calling them by their
719960	725960	first names your parents quote C Val is testing their authority and commitment
725960	730320	to him she noted at one point when quote when confronted with a parental
730320	734040	demand Val tons ask why and repeatedly asked the question to every
734040	739920	explanation offered Bill grumbled to the caseworker that you quote occasionally
739920	745400	cut corners in the completion of tasks but the caseworker says happily that
745400	748040	the difficulties encountered have been dealt with adequately and with
748040	751800	increasing skill for all concerned the predominant attitude is that of
751800	758600	optimism remember having to call it so many people dad so it's like everyone
758600	762560	wants me to call them dad and that's interesting yeah so what do you mean the
762560	768200	foster family yeah every foster family it's like call me dad okay you're not my
768240	773760	dad but we want you to call us me dad and her mom so he's always dad and mom
773760	780120	and every time it just it gets to be too much after three homes so yeah so after
780120	785120	yeah I remember my mom saying you have to call him dad call him dad okay dad dad
785120	791600	so he just sort of got into the you know the pattern of doing so but yeah I
791640	802240	remember that was a big issue it's these notes that the case worker left I mean
802240	805280	when you go through foster homes every foster family wants you to call them mom
805280	809920	or dad for in my case so it's just it's very awkward to have to do that and once
809920	813600	you get comfortable calling someone dad then you're going to another home you
813600	817040	have to call someone else mom and dad and as a kid it's very confusing yeah I
817040	820880	can't even imagine and then you sort of let it go after a while okay this is mom
820880	823800	and dad and you don't think about it but then every time you're taken out and
823800	829440	put into a new situation it's you know and look I yeah I mean and I think it's
829440	833660	probably completely normal that yeah reunited with your mom and the
833660	838720	stranger who you've never met before like you're not in the middle of my dad I
838720	843320	mean we sat in the back of a Volvo in Chicago when he told me that we were
843320	849400	gonna move to New Jersey and he was getting married to my mom and what I
849440	853960	thought about it well you didn't really ask now I don't think that's right
853960	857600	because I remember this is a gas station because my mom went to go to the gas
857600	861800	station and I was in the car and that's my dad took the time to talk to me so you
861800	866240	met him in Chicago yeah because you were still in foster care and they had
866240	869280	moved to New Jersey before you were out of foster care yeah so it must have just
869280	873160	been for a visit I suspect that they were there interesting okay that's good and
873160	877720	we went out and there was a couple times we went to Maine and I flew for
877760	881880	Thanksgiving that might have been the year before 1984 where they took me from
881880	887320	foster care to Maine for Thanksgiving and then I met all those bad whole family
887320	892680	there and then I went back to foster care I remember this okay that's good I
892680	900160	didn't I didn't know that okay so Bill at work
901160	907960	he is Merrill is like just out of control in those days coke in the
907960	911960	bathrooms strippers on the trading floor and your dad by those standards is a
911960	916680	complete nerd coke on the bathrooms in the Maryland yeah yeah that sounds about
916680	922440	yeah not that your dad was partaking but the answer he was really of course I
922440	926640	don't know that it's not the impression other colleagues had of him at the time
926640	932000	and he was described as a very nerdy kind of flabby and unathletic the last guy
932000	938000	you picked for a sports team maybe not at work but maybe afterward there's the
938000	943640	stuff about you know he twirls his pen when he's nervous which I also do and the
943640	949800	eyebrow tugging which is everyone who you told me about
950240	961640	let's see but look he's just like a he's kind of math skills bordering on the
961640	968440	savant and brilliant and yeah it's a great method for multiplying three
968440	974160	digit numbers I remember I can't remember his should remember it but I was
974160	978800	trying to explain it to you once a year ago you know you have like a 367 times
978840	983360	492 the way you broke it down and do it in your head was brilliant that's crazy
983360	987880	I've realized not that long ago that I have actually no idea how to do like
987880	993080	multiplication like that anymore yeah no I did back in school they like yeah
993080	998240	division either yeah division is terrible so I have confidence finance
998240	1005320	editor of the New York Times baby it's okay so he became not only like the math
1005360	1009560	wiz around there but was very he was kind of like a creative engineer and was
1009560	1014680	cooking up all these new types of derivatives that and back in this is
1014680	1018280	kind of like a transitional point in the finance industry at this point where
1018280	1023440	derivatives originally were conceived of I know you know but as a way for like
1023440	1027640	businesses to protect themselves against risks like interest rates change in or
1027640	1031840	dairy price if you're an ice cream company you know you want to hedge against
1032360	1037320	yeah exactly and but this is a point where they were also becoming like
1037320	1043160	gambling devices basically and so yeah at this point yeah they were credit
1043160	1048200	derivatives I mean credit derivative no not stuff like of that major but like
1048200	1052360	gambling version well interest rate swaps which were the one of the things
1052360	1057080	that your dad really pioneered worse in the they're in the infancy insurance
1057080	1061240	against against well that's what I'm saying it was it was both right I mean
1061280	1066880	the swamps were very good for clients and that's kind of the way your dad
1066880	1071360	manufactured them and the purpose they had but they were also the reason this
1071360	1073960	became such a lucrative business on Walter is in part there was a lot of
1073960	1079400	trading going on around them and so your dad when people realize that you can
1079400	1083640	make you can make money on these on the bets against bats yeah exactly huge
1083640	1088960	thing right so I've got a bunch of people here talking about the role your dad
1089000	1094600	played just how creative he was like what an instrumental role he played one
1094600	1098960	of his colleagues from back in the day who I'm not naming in this but he's a
1098960	1103720	guy who rose to the very top of Wall Street yeah says quote because of people
1103720	1107440	like Bill but maybe none more so than Bill the derivatives business went
1107440	1110560	mainstream in usage for investors as well as corporations financial
1110560	1115040	institutions and government agencies so he was really in the development of the
1115080	1120440	swaps market what your dad pioneered was one of the very most important things
1120440	1128720	that changed the finance industry over the past 40 years so Edson loved it
1128720	1133760	making a lot of money he and your dad actually once sat for an interview
1133760	1138280	together with the Chicago Caribbean this is in 1992 and they've got it's kind of
1138280	1144160	hilarious because Edson you know gregarious and charismatic is like such
1144200	1147640	a character yeah just palette Edson such a character you just kind of you know
1147640	1151360	like hamming it up kind of with the reporter and like all these kind of
1151360	1157160	like nice quotes very smooth and then your dad says his quote is we simulate
1157160	1160920	40 interest rates in yours every night it is a brute force simulated hedging
1160920	1166800	strategy it's a just like you know it's such a nerd yeah he plays a straight guy
1166800	1171280	to Edson yeah he plays a straight guy to Edson's Joker Laurel Hardy sort of
1171600	1176080	that's a good way of thinking about it and they're becoming as you know like
1176080	1180800	really good friends and the fan like you know that's it was a great great guy I
1180800	1184000	don't tell you I'm sure I told you I'm like everyone tells me that it's a great
1184000	1189480	great guy someone told me this anecdote I mean let's not get into the Edson
1189480	1194720	stuff he's that's just gonna derail us here oh no it's here it value it's two
1194720	1198320	o'clock right now yeah and we've been doing this for like an hour and a half
1198720	1205120	and a lot of time we're on page 28 right now everything else secondary to this
1205120	1211680	we're on page 28 of a 350 page book okay so if we continue at this pace we can
1211680	1219280	cancel dinner I mean it's fine just keep going I want everything Edson is you
1219280	1223080	know who Edson is your dad let's talk about how you how you have processed the
1223480	1232520	he is charismatic he is he is someone charismatic gregarious impulsive and needs
1232520	1237080	someone by his side to reign him in absolutely and who is that person that's my dad correct
1238840	1242360	and a lot of things say your dad apart and obviously his math skills the kind of
1242360	1247160	innovations with derivatives but one of the biggest things is that he is like
1247160	1251000	he's not a threat to people and he knows how to ask questions and he really wants
1251000	1254680	the answers he doesn't want to trick you he's got very correct yeah and he's got an
1254680	1259160	ability to listen also to hear but Edson are my dad your dad yeah okay there's
1259960	1263720	which is not the norm on wall street right like there's this is a place
1263720	1268280	while it's like filled everyone's trying to bulldoze well it's like well it's either that
1268280	1273400	it's like the it's kind of the kind of vaguely sociopathic personalities sure and it's these
1273400	1279480	socially maldraught like math nerds right who can't and your dad fits someone in between
1279560	1285480	yes exactly he's an early quant yeah but he he had human skills he didn't and that's normally
1285480	1291720	a lot of the quants are kind of like mildly on the spectrum and I don't well well you know you've
1291720	1300920	worked with a you know Tom or Todd Tom Tom um uh everyone in banking wants to make money but
1300920	1305000	there are different degrees of avarice one of Bill's colleagues and friends would explain
1305000	1312840	Bill was on the low end of that spectrum yeah um uh um there's a great anecdote
1314200	1318760	this isn't really involving well it is there's a guy named John Bright who is a particle
1318760	1323160	physicist at Merrill well he's a risk manager at Merrill he is a particle physicist by training
1323160	1328520	okay so Merrill was higher okay uh well they were they're higher in creating a halogen collider
1329480	1338040	thankfully no um but he was a risk manager and he was obviously very smart and he routinely would
1338040	1343400	say tell Edson's traders no we can't do that for this or that reason right and Edson would just
1343400	1350120	lose this shit and just erupt and we're like we'll fire you and Bill repeatedly would intervene
1350120	1355320	and save his job and say that's his job no no it would save John Bright so the risk manager who's
1355320	1359080	about to lose his job he's Edson's angry that the guy want to prove the trades his team wants to do
1359720	1364280	Bill intervenes and protects him saying that he's right um uh
1366440	1372440	talk a little bit about the Russian-Turkish baths and um vacation together in Maine
1373000	1378360	yeah he loved us but that place the baths yeah um and in Maine he told because he lived in
1378360	1383160	Rangeley and he bought a place down the street right in Brooklyn right yeah and Edson's kids
1383640	1390920	your parents is kind of a cool cultured couple uh in part because Allah seemed to derive pleasure
1390920	1397800	from tormenting Bill just kind of playfully uh I mean I don't know how playful that was uh
1398440	1407400	maybe um uh let's see Allah converts from Judaism to become Protestant yeah
1408360	1414280	for the parties she threw parties for the party oh for the parties well she would also throw
1414280	1420520	parties and she threw a great party she always was very good at that um people who went to some
1420520	1423880	of the parties would say that each time they went there they would notice that the dining room seemed
1423880	1432120	to have changed colors yeah and there's another party where um my mom's a very gifted interior
1432680	1438040	yeah she I mean that's what there's one party that she specifically put gold leaf all over the
1438040	1447640	ceilings uh which made quite an impression um okay so you at this time are having some troubles
1447640	1456680	it sounds like um the one person described how you had it I mean there were just stories going
1456680	1461560	around about what had happened to your actual your birth father right and you had told someone that
1461560	1465160	you had discovered him dead of a drug overdose again this isn't like you're in like fifth grade
1465800	1473080	not dead this is the way this person remembers it um uh there's a point in also in fifth grade
1473080	1477560	where you briefly ran away from home as this person recalls it this is one of your friends
1477560	1487160	in fifth grade yeah Pat um Patrick Gorman yeah he's got it all wrong okay does he what happened
1487160	1492360	I never ran away from home what's he referring to and I never saw my father dead of a drug overdose
1492360	1496520	so I he's referring to no no he's not saying no this wasn't just Pat by the way this is someone
1496520	1502600	else as well there's um it doesn't matter let's I know it's important I mean I never ran away from
1502600	1509160	home um what's he referring to he's referring to when I was going to be sent to Rocky Mountain
1509160	1515800	Academy then I thought we had a plan of uh breaking me driving to Florida to live at my
1515800	1521640	friend's Florida house and stealing the car and driving all the way to Florida but it was just
1521640	1526600	a bunch of talk and no one never did anything and instead I got on the plane the next day and went to
1526600	1533080	the SUWS in Idaho and then from there I went to Rocky Mountain Academy he's saying this is in
1533080	1538040	fifth grade though and that was not until like your what junior and senior year of high school yeah
1538040	1542920	this is much later he's saying this is happening in fifth grade yep I ran away from home in fifth
1542920	1549080	grade I mean not for like a long time but like there is he just got his brief um he ran away to
1549080	1555000	my friend's house possibly to spend the night there it's not a deal let's move on that was
1555000	1562280	strange um and um and I remember you back I'm recounting the wonderful tale of you your dad
1562280	1571000	taking you to work at Merrill and you were about 12 and uh he's introducing you around and one of
1571560	1577080	poor colleagues comes up and says oh I could see the resemblance that was funny and my dad I looked
1577080	1582360	at each other and just laughed yeah that's what he and and Bill told the colleague there was an
1582360	1589880	inside joke and tried to kind of make him feel better about himself um and um and so
1590200	1593880	so okay um
1596840	1601720	I've talked to a number of people who perceived
1604200	1613080	feel like they noticed at the time uh that there was much more warmth from your dad to your sisters
1613080	1620360	than to you okay um my sisters or babies or kids well this is by the time we are getting a little
1620360	1627720	bit older at this point um uh I don't have a specific year but this was probably when you were
1627720	1634200	like 12 or 13 or so yeah my sisters were yeah they were young they were there's a lot of warmth to
1634200	1639000	my sisters when you're kids and babies and children there was everyone had warmth to them
1639800	1644360	yeah everyone has warmth toward little kids I agree yeah um you can't uh
1646920	1653480	I'm not making much effort I'm saying I'm trying to qualify warmth from the 13 year old son to two
1654280	1659960	two babies it's very it's a very strange statement that someone would make at that
1659960	1664600	a couple of people made that statement anyway there's it's a perception thing right and like
1664600	1669640	it's not necessarily a right perception or a wrong perception okay so you're at 13 if I've
1669640	1675800	got this right you were sent to Dublin school is that right um yeah okay uh and you were kicked out
1675800	1682600	after a while for smoking yes and having weed is that the first time I was kicked out for smoking
1682600	1691480	on the charlotte's right and then the second time I was kicked out for smoking weed yeah okay um
1693320	1703480	and um and you all the time had like asked and that weed came from uh the writer what's his
1703560	1710760	fucking name again this is blank the other writer that's always pg o rork pg o rork's weed yes
1713240	1720840	um he grew it in his in his backyard in uh peterborough or let's see a joining town
1720840	1725960	exit Dublin I think it's peterborough that's where he lives okay for some reason he liked to have
1725960	1731960	high school kids hang out at his house and smoke weed it's a very strange guy yeah that's strange
1731960	1734760	yeah it's very strange okay so um
1737240	1743480	during this time you kind of periodically asked like why you had been in foster care yeah and
1744200	1751080	what I've got here is in particular your grandmother so all his mother yeah giving these kind of like
1751080	1755800	vague and not very convincing explanations about something about drinking bad milk yeah
1756040	1762120	something about your birth father's hospital I remember I went to the hospital um and my
1762120	1766920	grandmother we said it was from drinking bad milk and I remember being in this cage because
1766920	1772600	I was a kid so they had to put you in a crib but the crib had a top on it and that was like the
1772600	1777880	most claustrophobic crazy thing ever and I'm like screaming and yelling trying to get out of this
1777880	1783480	fucking cage and the nurses would come in and open up the top like I could breathe again it was just
1783560	1788840	terrible that sounds terrible it was terrible it was really bad I remember I think that's where
1788840	1794200	my this is before or after foster care this is during foster care wow at some point I don't
1794200	1797800	know why I had to go to the hospital and my grandmother said it was some bad milk I think
1797800	1804360	it was related to the time my father and I don't know what I mean I've always been told it's an
1804360	1809160	overdose but I don't know for sure if that was it's still the truth but again I get contradicting
1809160	1814600	stories right constantly um but I do remember being in the hospital what did your mom say
1814600	1820520	when you would ask her why you've been in foster care um she said it was my father was a drug addict
1820520	1827560	he's a terrible person and she was a great person and why did she then not get you out of foster
1827560	1837240	care yes sorry no definable no answer that's the sticks okay and they're they're always changing
1837240	1843000	to like when I was a kid it would be one thing when I got older was another thing so okay so you
1843000	1848360	then get sent off to Rocky Mountain Academy for your junior and senior years yeah and the high
1848360	1857640	school and the and the sophomore junior and senior yeah oh these are three years I thought
1858200	1868200	well it's like the second half of sophomore okay um uh so while you're there one of your classmates
1868200	1878440	is this guy this kid John Avila John Avila yeah um who is kind of a dork that people you know
1879320	1884680	did you describe the school yeah I described this I just the school is crazy it's crazy yeah um
1885880	1891080	uh but one day in 1994 and again this isn't even from you know you told me the story originally
1891080	1898440	but I verified this through um just their local news articles at the time uh how do you say it
1898440	1906600	Avila uh John Avila okay he uses a belt to hang himself from a pipe in his dorm room yeah and it
1906680	1912920	my dorm room that was actually your room uh yes that's my dorm room and I became the
1912920	1920520	dorm head like the guy in charge of the the dorm afterwards okay I'll move back in there um yeah
1920520	1925720	sorry no no no sorry no I became it was my dorm room after so when they for a month no one lived
1925720	1931400	in that in that dorm and then when they allowed people to move back in I was the one living in
1931400	1937880	there in the the dorm head of that okay this is called Camelot the name of the dorm is Camelot I
1937880	1943160	remember um yeah see I hung myself from the belt I had been living in a different dorm okay to that
1943720	1949240	um and anyway that obviously was like not uh that was a scarring experience and you
1949960	1953240	found yourself for years thinking about that and that was the end of that school
1953240	1958520	yeah from right back from that point when that suicide happened it took down the school
1959000	1965560	it did not right away it didn't that was there is 2002 yeah but it was a slow climb and that yeah
1965560	1973480	I mean that was yeah eight years later um it and then other incidents appeared to right yeah okay so um
1974360	1979960	then we get into the whole Orange County debacle right and your dad's role in it which is kind of a
1979960	1985880	seminal moment for him because he turned him into a superstar yeah it turned him and it kind of
1985880	1991320	created the legend of Bill yeah um and I don't think we need to go through that right now you know
1991320	1997960	that story this is like the story is what you know it to be did you find a copy of the memo yeah okay
1999480	2005000	um and okay all sorts of history about Deutsche Bank which we're not going to go through right now
2005000	2012600	one of the last things my dad was asking uh in December uh or fall of 2013 was if I had to copy
2012600	2018040	that memo because he wanted it and I sent it to him oh that's interesting yeah I was like why do you
2018040	2022440	want to say because he was going to start looking for new stuff and he wanted to copy the memo to
2022440	2027880	send to some employers or somebody for some some reason yeah I haven't actually found a copy of the
2027880	2032520	memo what I found or like there's like substantial excerpts of it yeah that were published at the
2032520	2039960	time in like the LA Times I'll see if I can find the full memo for you again um but yeah um okay and
2039960	2047240	that memo saved Merrill well that memo actually hurt Merrill in a sense because I did Merrill from
2047240	2051720	no it showed that it actually he was the opposite of that right it was like it showed Bill doing the
2051720	2058120	right thing yeah very much but Merrill disregarded his vice no no no Merrill way understood it was
2058120	2066600	that Merrill the Orange County said uh Merrill it'll advise them yes and my dad said uh this you know
2067240	2071400	Orange County don't do this deal don't do the trade yeah and on advice of Merrill because he
2071400	2077400	represented Merrill no that's not quite right the so Merrill had the West Coast sales team that was
2077400	2084200	selling all this shit to Orange County and it Bill and John Bright the risk manager the particle
2084200	2089240	physicist I mentioned earlier got we're getting very nervous about this and so and no one would
2089240	2095000	really listen and so Bill sat down and wrote this long memo showed it to Edson Edson signed the memo
2095000	2099800	and then they sent it far and wide in Merrill Merrill there's like a bit of a civil war inside
2099800	2105000	Merrill that's overstating a bit of a tug of war inside Merrill they disregarded it ultimately
2105000	2111320	and kept selling even more and that worked for another year yes okay and so the fact that Merrill
2111320	2116440	had known that this is really risky right actually hurt them but that's like definitely not your dad's
2116440	2121480	fault that's well the your dad can come out of that in suit in one of the case yeah they have billions
2121480	2127080	of dollars so or they're sued for billions not sure they should got it okay so Edson
2127080	2133720	got hired at Deutsche Bank I had confused it in my head you're right Edson got hired at Deutsche
2133720	2141480	in 95 first thing he does is well he hired a bunch of people there well they retired first
2143240	2148520	what do you mean they both retired Edson and my dad had retired first Edson didn't retire first
2148520	2155240	I think he did no I mean I've got the chronology pretty solidly from people around him he he got
2155240	2159320	the job offer he took a helicopter at Princeton in Jersey where there's a retreat from Merrill
2159880	2164520	and told him I'm done give me the helicopter back to New York oh really he went to lunch that day
2165160	2175320	and I didn't know that interesting so Edson's first person he wants to hire is your dad
2175400	2179960	he doesn't do that well your dad says no and I'll get to why in a second he ends up hiring
2180760	2187640	kind of a small clique of people from Merrill one of whom one is Cassie Cabetti yeah do you
2187640	2195240	know Cassie yeah I do and who's a comedian okay another is Michael Phillip I don't know if you
2195240	2205800	ever crossed paths with him I don't remember Michael and another is Anshu Anshu so Bill said no
2205800	2211320	and Cassie's a brilliant guy too yeah I know and had a supermodel for a wife for a while yeah
2216040	2221960	so Bill said no part of it is that like it seemed like Edson was taking this huge risk
2222280	2226440	another part of it a big part was the Orange County mess was still playing out
2226440	2231000	who said no what was that who said no Bill said no your father said no I'm not kind of with you
2231000	2237880	Edson and the Orange County mess was still playing out in the legal system and in the press
2237880	2241880	and your dad wanted to stay at Merrill to help clean it up the biggest thing though is that he
2241880	2248520	was tired and which is a little unusual for a 40-year-old investment banker to admit to but
2249240	2255160	he wanted a break and so he announced he got in agreement with Merrill in March of 96
2255880	2261000	that he was retiring or taking a paid leave of absence Merrill's public statement at the time was
2261000	2265960	that he was leaving to spend more time with his family which is typically like a euphemism for
2265960	2272600	someone resigning in disgrace but in your dad's case it was actually true one little bit of hilarity
2272600	2279400	that I love is that when Bill rebuffed Edson Edson you know like the normal the normal thing to do
2279400	2284520	that situation is you know beg and plead and then if he says no okay see you later dude right uh
2284520	2290200	instead Edson enlisted Bill to interview job candidates on his behalf for jobs at Deutsche
2290200	2296200	Bank for even though even though Bill was his competitor right and Bill did it yeah and I've
2296200	2300920	talked to a couple of people who he interviewed and is like he was that's funny he's a good job
2300920	2307000	and candidate interviewer Edson's way to get him to take the job so yeah well the way to get him to
2307000	2312600	take the job that I want you to have the way that he got him to take the job was they were both families
2312600	2318760	were in Maine a few months later so a few months after Bill retires in March of 96 and Bill is still
2318760	2324920	saying no no no no although he'd missed the adrenaline on Wall Street uh the issue of working
2324920	2332040	for a German bank was kind of unpalatable for the Brooksman family given what uh you know the role
2332040	2342520	that Nazis had played in there in their lives and um so Edson figured out a way to convince Bill
2342520	2348600	and do you want to guess what that way was what was it he dangled a lot of money in Ola's face
2349160	2355480	oh my mom speaks very clever uh so he basically said how much money your dad could expect to make
2355480	2361560	and then he walked away and let Ola do the rest and she did and she pushed and pushed and pushed
2362360	2370840	and so in November of 96 so that's about let's see that's eight months after he retired from
2370840	2379080	Errol he and Ola and the girls moved to London you're in college at the time so you stay in the
2379080	2390920	States um and immediately they get taken out to dinner by Edson and Susan right and uh the recollection
2390920	2397800	of someone who's at a dinner is that Ola complained the whole time that Bill had refused to splurge
2397800	2410200	on business class tickets um okay so you're at Albright college um Matt Goldsboro recounted for
2410200	2418440	me the tale of you guys uh your little heist of uh the band room or the music room uh which um
2418680	2426120	Matt thought was pretty badass to quote him um and you were also the guy who became known
2427080	2431480	for you know trying to make girl get girls to make out with each other three in the morning
2431480	2438040	and find some coca three in the morning and uh not in a bad way people said this with admiration um
2439400	2447400	do you remember the your samurai sword yes oh i love that sword um says someone told me the
2447400	2455480	anecdote of how you the like RA was trying to get you to turn the music down like in the middle of
2455480	2462520	the night and you wouldn't and a football player got involved like threatened you and you went into
2462520	2469240	a room and emerged in a black cape with a samurai sword and said they're trying to kill the funk
2469240	2476520	whoever wants to kill the funk is going to have to kill me first uh so um yes wonderful college
2476600	2483960	days yeah god only knows what else we both have uh lurking in our college exactly um
2483960	2489720	to intrude upon your college when i do some research on you yeah let's not that happened with me uh
2489720	2494360	during the Kavanaugh hearings we had written some stories about Brett Kavanaugh and in his
2494360	2500200	i read them all yeah and someone on twitter like came after me oh one of my college classmates came
2500200	2506920	after me saying and rich i remember i read that like you one day like puked in my bathroom and
2506920	2511880	he didn't clean it up and he didn't even ask for it i was like it's a very strange thing to i know
2511880	2519000	it's actually one with yeah it was it was strange uh okay as if that was going to derail your
2519080	2523000	comments on Brett Kavanaugh uh man very strange uh
2525560	2532840	so you guys are Deutsche Bank you guys are Deutsche Bank uh edson's a Deutsche Bank the team is a
2532840	2542920	Deutsche Bank one of bill's tasks assigned by edson uh was to try and pry power away from Germany
2542920	2548760	in the markets business um and which market well so edson was running the entire global
2548760	2554040	markets business and your dad was a co-head of proprietary trading specializing in credit derivatives
2554040	2560200	and credit yeah so but he his job and this is kind of a thankless job that was perfect for Bill
2560200	2565320	because he was so non-threatening and so good at like dealing with other human beings um
2566840	2571480	was that he needed to Deutsche Bank one of the many problems the bank had in these days
2571480	2577560	was that they had like in each german city so like not just like Berlin and Frankfurt but like
2578280	2584360	like Stuttgart and like Monheim and i'm just making shit up at this point but there's they each
2584360	2591560	are cities yeah you're not making them up i am actually german do you know that i do um so i
2591560	2597480	i'm a german citizen so that's why i call you enrique and not enrich uh you americanized your
2597480	2606760	name ellis island americanized uh uh anyway all of these places had their only little bond trading
2606760	2613880	outposts there's no coordinated uh strategy no mechanism and so bill was in charge of doing that
2614440	2619240	organizing the bond traders or of pulling all this power into london away from sovereignty
2619240	2624120	and the way bill described it at the time was the the situation that he was set out to fix was
2624120	2630200	quote the sort of thing that produced duplication of effort and dissipation of energies um which i
2630200	2638600	just love because it's you know yeah it's just it's bill yeah um he succeeded in that and things
2638600	2647800	are starting to click and he by uh you know in a year or two being at the bank um the customers
2647800	2653960	seem to be responding to all the changes they're making and he felt like this was finally the
2653960	2665240	moment where deutch a bank it was real and uh let's say they bought a mercedes which is interesting
2665240	2670600	because not long ago they had been very opposed to anything german very opposed to mercedes um i
2670600	2677400	thought that was interesting too um a conversation uh my dad eventually said oh carries it was years
2677400	2683880	ago they're not out to get us and then my mom was like yes no big deal it's my mom was more opposed
2683880	2690920	to mercedes and my dad should we pause remember i'm extremely hungry yeah okay
