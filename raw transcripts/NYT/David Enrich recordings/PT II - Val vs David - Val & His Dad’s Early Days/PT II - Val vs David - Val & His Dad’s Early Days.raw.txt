[00:00.000 --> 00:08.560]  going okay great okay so we were just getting into your parent your arrival in
[00:08.560 --> 00:15.840]  the United States and so 1982 Ola and Alexander get divorced yeah you go to
[00:15.840 --> 00:23.880]  live with your dad yeah and then I go through some of the frankly like awful
[00:23.880 --> 00:29.400]  memories you have so we've got you him your dad taking you to a horror movie and
[00:29.400 --> 00:33.920]  you were so scared to be puked in the aisle Halloween what was hell oh that
[00:33.920 --> 00:41.560]  was the movie okay we've got your dad collapsing on the floor yeah frothing at
[00:41.560 --> 00:48.600]  the mouth like what the fuck was it and then we've got you guys ending up in
[00:48.600 --> 00:54.880]  the selection army homeless shelter and it which we've found together in those
[00:54.880 --> 01:01.640]  documents you got from Cook County and it one hot day in May of 1982 the juvenile
[01:01.640 --> 01:05.960]  court takes custody and it you know I'm just quoting from the court filing
[01:05.960 --> 01:09.440]  saying that you're neglected and that the miners parent does not provide the care
[01:09.440 --> 01:13.440]  necessary for the miners while being citing the mental and or physical
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.440]  disability of the parent noting that the court tried to track down your mom even
[01:19.440 --> 01:23.920]  running a newspaper ad in Chicago Sun-Times unsuccessfully and it turned
[01:23.960 --> 01:27.520]  out that she was staying in her mother's apartment which is just like a few miles
[01:27.520 --> 01:38.760]  away and so off you go into foster care which is like I'm not just doing this
[01:38.760 --> 01:45.400]  with a camera but it's that like on the scale of the pain associated with your
[01:45.400 --> 01:50.440]  dad's death which is worse like how does that come how does that these memories
[01:50.440 --> 01:57.960]  compare to that memory I mean well these memories are few and far between but
[01:57.960 --> 02:05.400]  they're not pleasant yeah I can't even imagine
[02:06.360 --> 02:14.960]  okay so now we switch back a bit to Bill's narrative and it he goes to
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.120]  Northwestern he goes to business school Northwestern did you exempt all this
[02:20.120 --> 02:27.560]  speculation about my mom yes okay should we say it for fun it's not necessary
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.320]  um man that fun
[02:34.400 --> 02:39.720]  okay so he gets a job that by the way was that shank I'm not since I'm not using
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.520]  that one good it was it was like one of the people that was in his circle at the
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.480]  time college friends I can't remember if the guy went to college I remember it was
[02:48.480 --> 02:52.140]  just in that circle okay I mean he said it on the record but I'm just since we're
[02:52.140 --> 03:02.040]  not you said it on the right yet was it verified by anyone else no okay um let's
[03:02.040 --> 03:07.080]  see okay so he graduated from business school gets a job of continental Illinois
[03:07.080 --> 03:11.080]  which is one of the biggest banks in the country at the time and this is where he
[03:11.120 --> 03:15.240]  really gets in derivatives and it's a blah blah blah I spent with derivatives are
[03:15.240 --> 03:25.360]  81 this is let's see what year is this yeah this is 81 or 82 and so this time
[03:25.360 --> 03:33.320]  derivatives were pretty much a sleepy tool used by a few banks by this it was it
[03:33.320 --> 03:39.520]  was like becoming a kind of an expanding lucrative niche for lots of banks like
[03:39.560 --> 03:44.160]  mortgages no it was well they were starting to one of your dad's
[03:44.160 --> 03:47.120]  innovations and I'll look kind of getting out of order here and that's fine
[03:47.120 --> 03:53.320]  okay was well let's just wait actually I'll go through it and of it so one day
[03:53.320 --> 03:59.840]  your dad it's actually a little unclear exactly where your parents met but
[03:59.840 --> 04:05.480]  there's the leading theory that I've heard it's a party what was that I can
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.000]  always know the story of the party what I've heard from more people is that he
[04:09.040 --> 04:14.000]  went into the Stanley Corsac store for some reason and met her I think this is
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.280]  after this party maybe that's the way I remember the story you see you remember
[04:19.280 --> 04:24.280]  the story being that they met like at a mutual friend's party yeah okay and then
[04:24.280 --> 04:28.480]  you went to see her at the store a few times oh that's interesting so okay well
[04:28.480 --> 04:38.120]  in any case the they became a couple they got engaged in 1983 and in March of
[04:38.120 --> 04:46.400]  1984 Reverend Jack officiated their wedding so we go through some more of
[04:46.400 --> 04:52.160]  your like not very pleasant foster care memories here which we don't need to do
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.480]  unless you want to which ones I want to okay sure I'm happy to if you want to
[04:55.480 --> 05:00.360]  sure okay so and we talked about this a little bit yesterday there's this
[05:00.360 --> 05:05.160]  wonderful photo of you and your dad together in the I guess in the social
[05:05.160 --> 05:10.600]  workers place and you know you seated together on the carpet and there's a
[05:10.600 --> 05:17.200]  game and I just physically describe you guys and there's like a big pile the
[05:17.200 --> 05:21.040]  brown leather jacket on an orange sofa and a small pile of black and white
[05:21.040 --> 05:23.880]  photos that I guess you guys were looking at together maybe back from your
[05:23.880 --> 05:32.680]  time in Ukraine but a picture of him on a it's really tank right he sent that to
[05:32.680 --> 05:36.880]  you didn't wasn't that was after he disappeared that wasn't I think so yeah
[05:36.880 --> 05:43.240]  I mean my memory is foggy yeah yeah and then he had sent me a photo of him on a
[05:43.240 --> 05:50.000]  tank and a toy tank and a canteen Israeli canteen like a army canteen right but
[05:50.000 --> 06:05.160]  that was after he disappeared I think so so there's another very painful memory
[06:05.160 --> 06:09.200]  about you're in the basement of the social workers office with a bunch of
[06:09.200 --> 06:13.560]  other kids you're bickering over the rules of connect for yes the door at the
[06:13.560 --> 06:21.180]  top of the stairs opens all the kids stop what they're doing someone's name is
[06:21.180 --> 06:24.560]  gonna get called and that means their parents are there for a visit and you're
[06:24.560 --> 06:29.760]  not just a visit to take yeah your your name gets called you run up the stairs
[06:29.760 --> 06:35.600]  your mom's gonna be there maybe she's gonna take you home and it's not your
[06:35.600 --> 06:41.200]  mom it's Helen the social worker and she's there to inform me that you're
[06:41.200 --> 06:45.920]  being assigned to a new family did you talk to her no I didn't I don't even know
[06:45.920 --> 06:49.280]  she's still alive yeah this is a long time ago
[06:49.280 --> 06:55.160]  I remember her she was in very nice it's kind of short long blonde hair nice voice
[06:55.160 --> 07:00.000]  Midwestern very kind person
[07:00.000 --> 07:11.760]  okay and she would take me from one home to the other whenever leave one she'd
[07:11.760 --> 07:15.900]  always take me and drive me I remember always stopping McDonald's cuz I love
[07:15.900 --> 07:21.720]  McDonald's he doesn't love McDonald's at that age every kid yeah yes she was very
[07:21.720 --> 07:27.040]  nice get some more water but yeah go on sorry okay so we kind of shift gears a
[07:27.040 --> 07:35.120]  little bit here for a while that stuff's not related to you guys so in
[07:35.120 --> 07:49.440]  early 1984 Edson hires Bill at Merrill and yeah which is right as continental
[07:49.440 --> 07:54.520]  Illinois is about to collapse so it's fortuitous time so he was poached yeah
[07:54.520 --> 08:02.080]  he was hot Edson hired that's an idea so how did Edson meet him they that's a
[08:02.080 --> 08:05.400]  little unclear actually how they met they were both working in Chicago banking
[08:05.400 --> 08:15.760]  for a while they're both at Connell no Edson was at Bank of America okay anyway
[08:15.760 --> 08:24.560]  your parents moved to Short Hills so it doesn't want to know about two pots are
[08:24.560 --> 08:28.400]  sick I know it's okay just to give her a quick text I'm just we can just keep it
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.720]  rolling okay um don't make you go on yeah she says a casual pizza place or
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.560]  something more upscale like manual at LA what do you do mine I mean what do you
[08:38.560 --> 08:45.600]  want to do is it nice yeah they're paying and let's it's unhappiness ours by
[08:45.600 --> 08:58.320]  house in words yeah yeah is it would be open run seven
[08:59.080 --> 09:19.440]  no oh yeah yeah she's gonna do it yeah great okay okay it sounds fine so I'm
[09:19.440 --> 09:27.680]  accustomed to dealing with no I did I want to meet him but yeah get rid of
[09:27.680 --> 09:46.960]  him I'm curious to meet him okay wait there wait hang on hang on they're gonna
[09:46.960 --> 09:50.640]  pay for this I don't know they haven't said we're paying so should I just say are
[09:50.640 --> 09:55.640]  you paying yeah yeah say if you're paying that sounds great with like a
[09:55.640 --> 10:06.520]  smiley okay yeah I'm assuming you're paying smiley yeah or Roseanne is
[10:06.520 --> 10:17.440]  depends he's paying I'm not coming from oh I see that's when he takes me to a
[10:17.440 --> 10:21.680]  restaurant it's always like Donald well we're just talking about the reality is
[10:21.680 --> 10:30.360]  always looking down smiley face sounds great depends he's paying exclamation
[10:30.520 --> 10:37.520]  smiley face sometimes just a lot easier to write smiley face than to actually go
[10:37.520 --> 10:43.600]  find the emoji for smiley face David I are working right now I'll just let her
[10:43.600 --> 10:50.840]  know I'll just stay she's okay all right let's keep going here okay so shortly
[10:50.840 --> 10:56.400]  after they arrive in Short Hills they decide that they want you yeah and it
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.880]  takes a while but by Thanksgiving of 1985 all is granted custody of you you're
[11:02.880 --> 11:07.920]  nine years old by this time I thought that was 1984 it's 1985 she initiated
[11:07.920 --> 11:14.760]  proceeding in 1984 but it was not until 1985 that she got you back those fall of
[11:14.760 --> 11:24.120]  85 yes Thanksgiving and it so I'll look at some counseling at the request of
[11:24.120 --> 11:30.640]  Jersey social services and it gets the family you guys get a caseworker who
[11:30.640 --> 11:36.960]  comes and visits and the caseworker notes that you have lots of toys in a
[11:36.960 --> 11:42.120]  very nice bedroom and what you want you tend to get and that you're having it's
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.200]  caseworker said what I want to get not in those words but yeah that you get lots
[11:46.200 --> 11:51.400]  of material possessions however you're having it's taking a while for you to
[11:51.400 --> 11:56.440]  get like to open up emotionally to your parents understandably you're starting to
[11:56.440 --> 11:59.960]  give hugs and kisses but you're also insisting on calling them by their
[11:59.960 --> 12:05.960]  first names your parents quote C Val is testing their authority and commitment
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.320]  to him she noted at one point when quote when confronted with a parental
[12:10.320 --> 12:14.040]  demand Val tons ask why and repeatedly asked the question to every
[12:14.040 --> 12:19.920]  explanation offered Bill grumbled to the caseworker that you quote occasionally
[12:19.920 --> 12:25.400]  cut corners in the completion of tasks but the caseworker says happily that
[12:25.400 --> 12:28.040]  the difficulties encountered have been dealt with adequately and with
[12:28.040 --> 12:31.800]  increasing skill for all concerned the predominant attitude is that of
[12:31.800 --> 12:38.600]  optimism remember having to call it so many people dad so it's like everyone
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.560]  wants me to call them dad and that's interesting yeah so what do you mean the
[12:42.560 --> 12:48.200]  foster family yeah every foster family it's like call me dad okay you're not my
[12:48.240 --> 12:53.760]  dad but we want you to call us me dad and her mom so he's always dad and mom
[12:53.760 --> 13:00.120]  and every time it just it gets to be too much after three homes so yeah so after
[13:00.120 --> 13:05.120]  yeah I remember my mom saying you have to call him dad call him dad okay dad dad
[13:05.120 --> 13:11.600]  so he just sort of got into the you know the pattern of doing so but yeah I
[13:11.640 --> 13:22.240]  remember that was a big issue it's these notes that the case worker left I mean
[13:22.240 --> 13:25.280]  when you go through foster homes every foster family wants you to call them mom
[13:25.280 --> 13:29.920]  or dad for in my case so it's just it's very awkward to have to do that and once
[13:29.920 --> 13:33.600]  you get comfortable calling someone dad then you're going to another home you
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.040]  have to call someone else mom and dad and as a kid it's very confusing yeah I
[13:37.040 --> 13:40.880]  can't even imagine and then you sort of let it go after a while okay this is mom
[13:40.880 --> 13:43.800]  and dad and you don't think about it but then every time you're taken out and
[13:43.800 --> 13:49.440]  put into a new situation it's you know and look I yeah I mean and I think it's
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.660]  probably completely normal that yeah reunited with your mom and the
[13:53.660 --> 13:58.720]  stranger who you've never met before like you're not in the middle of my dad I
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.320]  mean we sat in the back of a Volvo in Chicago when he told me that we were
[14:03.320 --> 14:09.400]  gonna move to New Jersey and he was getting married to my mom and what I
[14:09.440 --> 14:13.960]  thought about it well you didn't really ask now I don't think that's right
[14:13.960 --> 14:17.600]  because I remember this is a gas station because my mom went to go to the gas
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.800]  station and I was in the car and that's my dad took the time to talk to me so you
[14:21.800 --> 14:26.240]  met him in Chicago yeah because you were still in foster care and they had
[14:26.240 --> 14:29.280]  moved to New Jersey before you were out of foster care yeah so it must have just
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.160]  been for a visit I suspect that they were there interesting okay that's good and
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.720]  we went out and there was a couple times we went to Maine and I flew for
[14:37.760 --> 14:41.880]  Thanksgiving that might have been the year before 1984 where they took me from
[14:41.880 --> 14:47.320]  foster care to Maine for Thanksgiving and then I met all those bad whole family
[14:47.320 --> 14:52.680]  there and then I went back to foster care I remember this okay that's good I
[14:52.680 --> 15:00.160]  didn't I didn't know that okay so Bill at work
[15:01.160 --> 15:07.960]  he is Merrill is like just out of control in those days coke in the
[15:07.960 --> 15:11.960]  bathrooms strippers on the trading floor and your dad by those standards is a
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.680]  complete nerd coke on the bathrooms in the Maryland yeah yeah that sounds about
[15:16.680 --> 15:22.440]  yeah not that your dad was partaking but the answer he was really of course I
[15:22.440 --> 15:26.640]  don't know that it's not the impression other colleagues had of him at the time
[15:26.640 --> 15:32.000]  and he was described as a very nerdy kind of flabby and unathletic the last guy
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  you picked for a sports team maybe not at work but maybe afterward there's the
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.640]  stuff about you know he twirls his pen when he's nervous which I also do and the
[15:43.640 --> 15:49.800]  eyebrow tugging which is everyone who you told me about
[15:50.240 --> 16:01.640]  let's see but look he's just like a he's kind of math skills bordering on the
[16:01.640 --> 16:08.440]  savant and brilliant and yeah it's a great method for multiplying three
[16:08.440 --> 16:14.160]  digit numbers I remember I can't remember his should remember it but I was
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.800]  trying to explain it to you once a year ago you know you have like a 367 times
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.360]  492 the way you broke it down and do it in your head was brilliant that's crazy
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.880]  I've realized not that long ago that I have actually no idea how to do like
[16:27.880 --> 16:33.080]  multiplication like that anymore yeah no I did back in school they like yeah
[16:33.080 --> 16:38.240]  division either yeah division is terrible so I have confidence finance
[16:38.240 --> 16:45.320]  editor of the New York Times baby it's okay so he became not only like the math
[16:45.360 --> 16:49.560]  wiz around there but was very he was kind of like a creative engineer and was
[16:49.560 --> 16:54.680]  cooking up all these new types of derivatives that and back in this is
[16:54.680 --> 16:58.280]  kind of like a transitional point in the finance industry at this point where
[16:58.280 --> 17:03.440]  derivatives originally were conceived of I know you know but as a way for like
[17:03.440 --> 17:07.640]  businesses to protect themselves against risks like interest rates change in or
[17:07.640 --> 17:11.840]  dairy price if you're an ice cream company you know you want to hedge against
[17:12.360 --> 17:17.320]  yeah exactly and but this is a point where they were also becoming like
[17:17.320 --> 17:23.160]  gambling devices basically and so yeah at this point yeah they were credit
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.200]  derivatives I mean credit derivative no not stuff like of that major but like
[17:28.200 --> 17:32.360]  gambling version well interest rate swaps which were the one of the things
[17:32.360 --> 17:37.080]  that your dad really pioneered worse in the they're in the infancy insurance
[17:37.080 --> 17:41.240]  against against well that's what I'm saying it was it was both right I mean
[17:41.280 --> 17:46.880]  the swamps were very good for clients and that's kind of the way your dad
[17:46.880 --> 17:51.360]  manufactured them and the purpose they had but they were also the reason this
[17:51.360 --> 17:53.960]  became such a lucrative business on Walter is in part there was a lot of
[17:53.960 --> 17:59.400]  trading going on around them and so your dad when people realize that you can
[17:59.400 --> 18:03.640]  make you can make money on these on the bets against bats yeah exactly huge
[18:03.640 --> 18:08.960]  thing right so I've got a bunch of people here talking about the role your dad
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.600]  played just how creative he was like what an instrumental role he played one
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.960]  of his colleagues from back in the day who I'm not naming in this but he's a
[18:18.960 --> 18:23.720]  guy who rose to the very top of Wall Street yeah says quote because of people
[18:23.720 --> 18:27.440]  like Bill but maybe none more so than Bill the derivatives business went
[18:27.440 --> 18:30.560]  mainstream in usage for investors as well as corporations financial
[18:30.560 --> 18:35.040]  institutions and government agencies so he was really in the development of the
[18:35.080 --> 18:40.440]  swaps market what your dad pioneered was one of the very most important things
[18:40.440 --> 18:48.720]  that changed the finance industry over the past 40 years so Edson loved it
[18:48.720 --> 18:53.760]  making a lot of money he and your dad actually once sat for an interview
[18:53.760 --> 18:58.280]  together with the Chicago Caribbean this is in 1992 and they've got it's kind of
[18:58.280 --> 19:04.160]  hilarious because Edson you know gregarious and charismatic is like such
[19:04.200 --> 19:07.640]  a character yeah just palette Edson such a character you just kind of you know
[19:07.640 --> 19:11.360]  like hamming it up kind of with the reporter and like all these kind of
[19:11.360 --> 19:17.160]  like nice quotes very smooth and then your dad says his quote is we simulate
[19:17.160 --> 19:20.920]  40 interest rates in yours every night it is a brute force simulated hedging
[19:20.920 --> 19:26.800]  strategy it's a just like you know it's such a nerd yeah he plays a straight guy
[19:26.800 --> 19:31.280]  to Edson yeah he plays a straight guy to Edson's Joker Laurel Hardy sort of
[19:31.600 --> 19:36.080]  that's a good way of thinking about it and they're becoming as you know like
[19:36.080 --> 19:40.800]  really good friends and the fan like you know that's it was a great great guy I
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.000]  don't tell you I'm sure I told you I'm like everyone tells me that it's a great
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.480]  great guy someone told me this anecdote I mean let's not get into the Edson
[19:49.480 --> 19:54.720]  stuff he's that's just gonna derail us here oh no it's here it value it's two
[19:54.720 --> 19:58.320]  o'clock right now yeah and we've been doing this for like an hour and a half
[19:58.720 --> 20:05.120]  and a lot of time we're on page 28 right now everything else secondary to this
[20:05.120 --> 20:11.680]  we're on page 28 of a 350 page book okay so if we continue at this pace we can
[20:11.680 --> 20:19.280]  cancel dinner I mean it's fine just keep going I want everything Edson is you
[20:19.280 --> 20:23.080]  know who Edson is your dad let's talk about how you how you have processed the
[20:23.480 --> 20:32.520]  he is charismatic he is he is someone charismatic gregarious impulsive and needs
[20:32.520 --> 20:37.080]  someone by his side to reign him in absolutely and who is that person that's my dad correct
[20:38.840 --> 20:42.360]  and a lot of things say your dad apart and obviously his math skills the kind of
[20:42.360 --> 20:47.160]  innovations with derivatives but one of the biggest things is that he is like
[20:47.160 --> 20:51.000]  he's not a threat to people and he knows how to ask questions and he really wants
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.680]  the answers he doesn't want to trick you he's got very correct yeah and he's got an
[20:54.680 --> 20:59.160]  ability to listen also to hear but Edson are my dad your dad yeah okay there's
[20:59.960 --> 21:03.720]  which is not the norm on wall street right like there's this is a place
[21:03.720 --> 21:08.280]  while it's like filled everyone's trying to bulldoze well it's like well it's either that
[21:08.280 --> 21:13.400]  it's like the it's kind of the kind of vaguely sociopathic personalities sure and it's these
[21:13.400 --> 21:19.480]  socially maldraught like math nerds right who can't and your dad fits someone in between
[21:19.560 --> 21:25.480]  yes exactly he's an early quant yeah but he he had human skills he didn't and that's normally
[21:25.480 --> 21:31.720]  a lot of the quants are kind of like mildly on the spectrum and I don't well well you know you've
[21:31.720 --> 21:40.920]  worked with a you know Tom or Todd Tom Tom um uh everyone in banking wants to make money but
[21:40.920 --> 21:45.000]  there are different degrees of avarice one of Bill's colleagues and friends would explain
[21:45.000 --> 21:52.840]  Bill was on the low end of that spectrum yeah um uh um there's a great anecdote
[21:54.200 --> 21:58.760]  this isn't really involving well it is there's a guy named John Bright who is a particle
[21:58.760 --> 22:03.160]  physicist at Merrill well he's a risk manager at Merrill he is a particle physicist by training
[22:03.160 --> 22:08.520]  okay so Merrill was higher okay uh well they were they're higher in creating a halogen collider
[22:09.480 --> 22:18.040]  thankfully no um but he was a risk manager and he was obviously very smart and he routinely would
[22:18.040 --> 22:23.400]  say tell Edson's traders no we can't do that for this or that reason right and Edson would just
[22:23.400 --> 22:30.120]  lose this shit and just erupt and we're like we'll fire you and Bill repeatedly would intervene
[22:30.120 --> 22:35.320]  and save his job and say that's his job no no it would save John Bright so the risk manager who's
[22:35.320 --> 22:39.080]  about to lose his job he's Edson's angry that the guy want to prove the trades his team wants to do
[22:39.720 --> 22:44.280]  Bill intervenes and protects him saying that he's right um uh
[22:46.440 --> 22:52.440]  talk a little bit about the Russian-Turkish baths and um vacation together in Maine
[22:53.000 --> 22:58.360]  yeah he loved us but that place the baths yeah um and in Maine he told because he lived in
[22:58.360 --> 23:03.160]  Rangeley and he bought a place down the street right in Brooklyn right yeah and Edson's kids
[23:03.640 --> 23:10.920]  your parents is kind of a cool cultured couple uh in part because Allah seemed to derive pleasure
[23:10.920 --> 23:17.800]  from tormenting Bill just kind of playfully uh I mean I don't know how playful that was uh
[23:18.440 --> 23:27.400]  maybe um uh let's see Allah converts from Judaism to become Protestant yeah
[23:28.360 --> 23:34.280]  for the parties she threw parties for the party oh for the parties well she would also throw
[23:34.280 --> 23:40.520]  parties and she threw a great party she always was very good at that um people who went to some
[23:40.520 --> 23:43.880]  of the parties would say that each time they went there they would notice that the dining room seemed
[23:43.880 --> 23:52.120]  to have changed colors yeah and there's another party where um my mom's a very gifted interior
[23:52.680 --> 23:58.040]  yeah she I mean that's what there's one party that she specifically put gold leaf all over the
[23:58.040 --> 24:07.640]  ceilings uh which made quite an impression um okay so you at this time are having some troubles
[24:07.640 --> 24:16.680]  it sounds like um the one person described how you had it I mean there were just stories going
[24:16.680 --> 24:21.560]  around about what had happened to your actual your birth father right and you had told someone that
[24:21.560 --> 24:25.160]  you had discovered him dead of a drug overdose again this isn't like you're in like fifth grade
[24:25.800 --> 24:33.080]  not dead this is the way this person remembers it um uh there's a point in also in fifth grade
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.560]  where you briefly ran away from home as this person recalls it this is one of your friends
[24:37.560 --> 24:47.160]  in fifth grade yeah Pat um Patrick Gorman yeah he's got it all wrong okay does he what happened
[24:47.160 --> 24:52.360]  I never ran away from home what's he referring to and I never saw my father dead of a drug overdose
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.520]  so I he's referring to no no he's not saying no this wasn't just Pat by the way this is someone
[24:56.520 --> 25:02.600]  else as well there's um it doesn't matter let's I know it's important I mean I never ran away from
[25:02.600 --> 25:09.160]  home um what's he referring to he's referring to when I was going to be sent to Rocky Mountain
[25:09.160 --> 25:15.800]  Academy then I thought we had a plan of uh breaking me driving to Florida to live at my
[25:15.800 --> 25:21.640]  friend's Florida house and stealing the car and driving all the way to Florida but it was just
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.600]  a bunch of talk and no one never did anything and instead I got on the plane the next day and went to
[25:26.600 --> 25:33.080]  the SUWS in Idaho and then from there I went to Rocky Mountain Academy he's saying this is in
[25:33.080 --> 25:38.040]  fifth grade though and that was not until like your what junior and senior year of high school yeah
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.920]  this is much later he's saying this is happening in fifth grade yep I ran away from home in fifth
[25:42.920 --> 25:49.080]  grade I mean not for like a long time but like there is he just got his brief um he ran away to
[25:49.080 --> 25:55.000]  my friend's house possibly to spend the night there it's not a deal let's move on that was
[25:55.000 --> 26:02.280]  strange um and um and I remember you back I'm recounting the wonderful tale of you your dad
[26:02.280 --> 26:11.000]  taking you to work at Merrill and you were about 12 and uh he's introducing you around and one of
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.080]  poor colleagues comes up and says oh I could see the resemblance that was funny and my dad I looked
[26:17.080 --> 26:22.360]  at each other and just laughed yeah that's what he and and Bill told the colleague there was an
[26:22.360 --> 26:29.880]  inside joke and tried to kind of make him feel better about himself um and um and so
[26:30.200 --> 26:33.880]  so okay um
[26:36.840 --> 26:41.720]  I've talked to a number of people who perceived
[26:44.200 --> 26:53.080]  feel like they noticed at the time uh that there was much more warmth from your dad to your sisters
[26:53.080 --> 27:00.360]  than to you okay um my sisters or babies or kids well this is by the time we are getting a little
[27:00.360 --> 27:07.720]  bit older at this point um uh I don't have a specific year but this was probably when you were
[27:07.720 --> 27:14.200]  like 12 or 13 or so yeah my sisters were yeah they were young they were there's a lot of warmth to
[27:14.200 --> 27:19.000]  my sisters when you're kids and babies and children there was everyone had warmth to them
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.360]  yeah everyone has warmth toward little kids I agree yeah um you can't uh
[27:26.920 --> 27:33.480]  I'm not making much effort I'm saying I'm trying to qualify warmth from the 13 year old son to two
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.960]  two babies it's very it's a very strange statement that someone would make at that
[27:39.960 --> 27:44.600]  a couple of people made that statement anyway there's it's a perception thing right and like
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.640]  it's not necessarily a right perception or a wrong perception okay so you're at 13 if I've
[27:49.640 --> 27:55.800]  got this right you were sent to Dublin school is that right um yeah okay uh and you were kicked out
[27:55.800 --> 28:02.600]  after a while for smoking yes and having weed is that the first time I was kicked out for smoking
[28:02.600 --> 28:11.480]  on the charlotte's right and then the second time I was kicked out for smoking weed yeah okay um
[28:13.320 --> 28:23.480]  and um and you all the time had like asked and that weed came from uh the writer what's his
[28:23.560 --> 28:30.760]  fucking name again this is blank the other writer that's always pg o rork pg o rork's weed yes
[28:33.240 --> 28:40.840]  um he grew it in his in his backyard in uh peterborough or let's see a joining town
[28:40.840 --> 28:45.960]  exit Dublin I think it's peterborough that's where he lives okay for some reason he liked to have
[28:45.960 --> 28:51.960]  high school kids hang out at his house and smoke weed it's a very strange guy yeah that's strange
[28:51.960 --> 28:54.760]  yeah it's very strange okay so um
[28:57.240 --> 29:03.480]  during this time you kind of periodically asked like why you had been in foster care yeah and
[29:04.200 --> 29:11.080]  what I've got here is in particular your grandmother so all his mother yeah giving these kind of like
[29:11.080 --> 29:15.800]  vague and not very convincing explanations about something about drinking bad milk yeah
[29:16.040 --> 29:22.120]  something about your birth father's hospital I remember I went to the hospital um and my
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.920]  grandmother we said it was from drinking bad milk and I remember being in this cage because
[29:26.920 --> 29:32.600]  I was a kid so they had to put you in a crib but the crib had a top on it and that was like the
[29:32.600 --> 29:37.880]  most claustrophobic crazy thing ever and I'm like screaming and yelling trying to get out of this
[29:37.880 --> 29:43.480]  fucking cage and the nurses would come in and open up the top like I could breathe again it was just
[29:43.560 --> 29:48.840]  terrible that sounds terrible it was terrible it was really bad I remember I think that's where
[29:48.840 --> 29:54.200]  my this is before or after foster care this is during foster care wow at some point I don't
[29:54.200 --> 29:57.800]  know why I had to go to the hospital and my grandmother said it was some bad milk I think
[29:57.800 --> 30:04.360]  it was related to the time my father and I don't know what I mean I've always been told it's an
[30:04.360 --> 30:09.160]  overdose but I don't know for sure if that was it's still the truth but again I get contradicting
[30:09.160 --> 30:14.600]  stories right constantly um but I do remember being in the hospital what did your mom say
[30:14.600 --> 30:20.520]  when you would ask her why you've been in foster care um she said it was my father was a drug addict
[30:20.520 --> 30:27.560]  he's a terrible person and she was a great person and why did she then not get you out of foster
[30:27.560 --> 30:37.240]  care yes sorry no definable no answer that's the sticks okay and they're they're always changing
[30:37.240 --> 30:43.000]  to like when I was a kid it would be one thing when I got older was another thing so okay so you
[30:43.000 --> 30:48.360]  then get sent off to Rocky Mountain Academy for your junior and senior years yeah and the high
[30:48.360 --> 30:57.640]  school and the and the sophomore junior and senior yeah oh these are three years I thought
[30:58.200 --> 31:08.200]  well it's like the second half of sophomore okay um uh so while you're there one of your classmates
[31:08.200 --> 31:18.440]  is this guy this kid John Avila John Avila yeah um who is kind of a dork that people you know
[31:19.320 --> 31:24.680]  did you describe the school yeah I described this I just the school is crazy it's crazy yeah um
[31:25.880 --> 31:31.080]  uh but one day in 1994 and again this isn't even from you know you told me the story originally
[31:31.080 --> 31:38.440]  but I verified this through um just their local news articles at the time uh how do you say it
[31:38.440 --> 31:46.600]  Avila uh John Avila okay he uses a belt to hang himself from a pipe in his dorm room yeah and it
[31:46.680 --> 31:52.920]  my dorm room that was actually your room uh yes that's my dorm room and I became the
[31:52.920 --> 32:00.520]  dorm head like the guy in charge of the the dorm afterwards okay I'll move back in there um yeah
[32:00.520 --> 32:05.720]  sorry no no no sorry no I became it was my dorm room after so when they for a month no one lived
[32:05.720 --> 32:11.400]  in that in that dorm and then when they allowed people to move back in I was the one living in
[32:11.400 --> 32:17.880]  there in the the dorm head of that okay this is called Camelot the name of the dorm is Camelot I
[32:17.880 --> 32:23.160]  remember um yeah see I hung myself from the belt I had been living in a different dorm okay to that
[32:23.720 --> 32:29.240]  um and anyway that obviously was like not uh that was a scarring experience and you
[32:29.960 --> 32:33.240]  found yourself for years thinking about that and that was the end of that school
[32:33.240 --> 32:38.520]  yeah from right back from that point when that suicide happened it took down the school
[32:39.000 --> 32:45.560]  it did not right away it didn't that was there is 2002 yeah but it was a slow climb and that yeah
[32:45.560 --> 32:53.480]  I mean that was yeah eight years later um it and then other incidents appeared to right yeah okay so um
[32:54.360 --> 32:59.960]  then we get into the whole Orange County debacle right and your dad's role in it which is kind of a
[32:59.960 --> 33:05.880]  seminal moment for him because he turned him into a superstar yeah it turned him and it kind of
[33:05.880 --> 33:11.320]  created the legend of Bill yeah um and I don't think we need to go through that right now you know
[33:11.320 --> 33:17.960]  that story this is like the story is what you know it to be did you find a copy of the memo yeah okay
[33:19.480 --> 33:25.000]  um and okay all sorts of history about Deutsche Bank which we're not going to go through right now
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.600]  one of the last things my dad was asking uh in December uh or fall of 2013 was if I had to copy
[33:32.600 --> 33:38.040]  that memo because he wanted it and I sent it to him oh that's interesting yeah I was like why do you
[33:38.040 --> 33:42.440]  want to say because he was going to start looking for new stuff and he wanted to copy the memo to
[33:42.440 --> 33:47.880]  send to some employers or somebody for some some reason yeah I haven't actually found a copy of the
[33:47.880 --> 33:52.520]  memo what I found or like there's like substantial excerpts of it yeah that were published at the
[33:52.520 --> 33:59.960]  time in like the LA Times I'll see if I can find the full memo for you again um but yeah um okay and
[33:59.960 --> 34:07.240]  that memo saved Merrill well that memo actually hurt Merrill in a sense because I did Merrill from
[34:07.240 --> 34:11.720]  no it showed that it actually he was the opposite of that right it was like it showed Bill doing the
[34:11.720 --> 34:18.120]  right thing yeah very much but Merrill disregarded his vice no no no Merrill way understood it was
[34:18.120 --> 34:26.600]  that Merrill the Orange County said uh Merrill it'll advise them yes and my dad said uh this you know
[34:27.240 --> 34:31.400]  Orange County don't do this deal don't do the trade yeah and on advice of Merrill because he
[34:31.400 --> 34:37.400]  represented Merrill no that's not quite right the so Merrill had the West Coast sales team that was
[34:37.400 --> 34:44.200]  selling all this shit to Orange County and it Bill and John Bright the risk manager the particle
[34:44.200 --> 34:49.240]  physicist I mentioned earlier got we're getting very nervous about this and so and no one would
[34:49.240 --> 34:55.000]  really listen and so Bill sat down and wrote this long memo showed it to Edson Edson signed the memo
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.800]  and then they sent it far and wide in Merrill Merrill there's like a bit of a civil war inside
[34:59.800 --> 35:05.000]  Merrill that's overstating a bit of a tug of war inside Merrill they disregarded it ultimately
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.320]  and kept selling even more and that worked for another year yes okay and so the fact that Merrill
[35:11.320 --> 35:16.440]  had known that this is really risky right actually hurt them but that's like definitely not your dad's
[35:16.440 --> 35:21.480]  fault that's well the your dad can come out of that in suit in one of the case yeah they have billions
[35:21.480 --> 35:27.080]  of dollars so or they're sued for billions not sure they should got it okay so Edson
[35:27.080 --> 35:33.720]  got hired at Deutsche Bank I had confused it in my head you're right Edson got hired at Deutsche
[35:33.720 --> 35:41.480]  in 95 first thing he does is well he hired a bunch of people there well they retired first
[35:43.240 --> 35:48.520]  what do you mean they both retired Edson and my dad had retired first Edson didn't retire first
[35:48.520 --> 35:55.240]  I think he did no I mean I've got the chronology pretty solidly from people around him he he got
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.320]  the job offer he took a helicopter at Princeton in Jersey where there's a retreat from Merrill
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.520]  and told him I'm done give me the helicopter back to New York oh really he went to lunch that day
[36:05.160 --> 36:15.320]  and I didn't know that interesting so Edson's first person he wants to hire is your dad
[36:15.400 --> 36:19.960]  he doesn't do that well your dad says no and I'll get to why in a second he ends up hiring
[36:20.760 --> 36:27.640]  kind of a small clique of people from Merrill one of whom one is Cassie Cabetti yeah do you
[36:27.640 --> 36:35.240]  know Cassie yeah I do and who's a comedian okay another is Michael Phillip I don't know if you
[36:35.240 --> 36:45.800]  ever crossed paths with him I don't remember Michael and another is Anshu Anshu so Bill said no
[36:45.800 --> 36:51.320]  and Cassie's a brilliant guy too yeah I know and had a supermodel for a wife for a while yeah
[36:56.040 --> 37:01.960]  so Bill said no part of it is that like it seemed like Edson was taking this huge risk
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.440]  another part of it a big part was the Orange County mess was still playing out
[37:06.440 --> 37:11.000]  who said no what was that who said no Bill said no your father said no I'm not kind of with you
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.880]  Edson and the Orange County mess was still playing out in the legal system and in the press
[37:17.880 --> 37:21.880]  and your dad wanted to stay at Merrill to help clean it up the biggest thing though is that he
[37:21.880 --> 37:28.520]  was tired and which is a little unusual for a 40-year-old investment banker to admit to but
[37:29.240 --> 37:35.160]  he wanted a break and so he announced he got in agreement with Merrill in March of 96
[37:35.880 --> 37:41.000]  that he was retiring or taking a paid leave of absence Merrill's public statement at the time was
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.960]  that he was leaving to spend more time with his family which is typically like a euphemism for
[37:45.960 --> 37:52.600]  someone resigning in disgrace but in your dad's case it was actually true one little bit of hilarity
[37:52.600 --> 37:59.400]  that I love is that when Bill rebuffed Edson Edson you know like the normal the normal thing to do
[37:59.400 --> 38:04.520]  that situation is you know beg and plead and then if he says no okay see you later dude right uh
[38:04.520 --> 38:10.200]  instead Edson enlisted Bill to interview job candidates on his behalf for jobs at Deutsche
[38:10.200 --> 38:16.200]  Bank for even though even though Bill was his competitor right and Bill did it yeah and I've
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.920]  talked to a couple of people who he interviewed and is like he was that's funny he's a good job
[38:20.920 --> 38:27.000]  and candidate interviewer Edson's way to get him to take the job so yeah well the way to get him to
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.600]  take the job that I want you to have the way that he got him to take the job was they were both families
[38:32.600 --> 38:38.760]  were in Maine a few months later so a few months after Bill retires in March of 96 and Bill is still
[38:38.760 --> 38:44.920]  saying no no no no although he'd missed the adrenaline on Wall Street uh the issue of working
[38:44.920 --> 38:52.040]  for a German bank was kind of unpalatable for the Brooksman family given what uh you know the role
[38:52.040 --> 39:02.520]  that Nazis had played in there in their lives and um so Edson figured out a way to convince Bill
[39:02.520 --> 39:08.600]  and do you want to guess what that way was what was it he dangled a lot of money in Ola's face
[39:09.160 --> 39:15.480]  oh my mom speaks very clever uh so he basically said how much money your dad could expect to make
[39:15.480 --> 39:21.560]  and then he walked away and let Ola do the rest and she did and she pushed and pushed and pushed
[39:22.360 --> 39:30.840]  and so in November of 96 so that's about let's see that's eight months after he retired from
[39:30.840 --> 39:39.080]  Errol he and Ola and the girls moved to London you're in college at the time so you stay in the
[39:39.080 --> 39:50.920]  States um and immediately they get taken out to dinner by Edson and Susan right and uh the recollection
[39:50.920 --> 39:57.800]  of someone who's at a dinner is that Ola complained the whole time that Bill had refused to splurge
[39:57.800 --> 40:10.200]  on business class tickets um okay so you're at Albright college um Matt Goldsboro recounted for
[40:10.200 --> 40:18.440]  me the tale of you guys uh your little heist of uh the band room or the music room uh which um
[40:18.680 --> 40:26.120]  Matt thought was pretty badass to quote him um and you were also the guy who became known
[40:27.080 --> 40:31.480]  for you know trying to make girl get girls to make out with each other three in the morning
[40:31.480 --> 40:38.040]  and find some coca three in the morning and uh not in a bad way people said this with admiration um
[40:39.400 --> 40:47.400]  do you remember the your samurai sword yes oh i love that sword um says someone told me the
[40:47.400 --> 40:55.480]  anecdote of how you the like RA was trying to get you to turn the music down like in the middle of
[40:55.480 --> 41:02.520]  the night and you wouldn't and a football player got involved like threatened you and you went into
[41:02.520 --> 41:09.240]  a room and emerged in a black cape with a samurai sword and said they're trying to kill the funk
[41:09.240 --> 41:16.520]  whoever wants to kill the funk is going to have to kill me first uh so um yes wonderful college
[41:16.600 --> 41:23.960]  days yeah god only knows what else we both have uh lurking in our college exactly um
[41:23.960 --> 41:29.720]  to intrude upon your college when i do some research on you yeah let's not that happened with me uh
[41:29.720 --> 41:34.360]  during the Kavanaugh hearings we had written some stories about Brett Kavanaugh and in his
[41:34.360 --> 41:40.200]  i read them all yeah and someone on twitter like came after me oh one of my college classmates came
[41:40.200 --> 41:46.920]  after me saying and rich i remember i read that like you one day like puked in my bathroom and
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.880]  he didn't clean it up and he didn't even ask for it i was like it's a very strange thing to i know
[41:51.880 --> 41:59.000]  it's actually one with yeah it was it was strange uh okay as if that was going to derail your
[41:59.080 --> 42:03.000]  comments on Brett Kavanaugh uh man very strange uh
[42:05.560 --> 42:12.840]  so you guys are Deutsche Bank you guys are Deutsche Bank uh edson's a Deutsche Bank the team is a
[42:12.840 --> 42:22.920]  Deutsche Bank one of bill's tasks assigned by edson uh was to try and pry power away from Germany
[42:22.920 --> 42:28.760]  in the markets business um and which market well so edson was running the entire global
[42:28.760 --> 42:34.040]  markets business and your dad was a co-head of proprietary trading specializing in credit derivatives
[42:34.040 --> 42:40.200]  and credit yeah so but he his job and this is kind of a thankless job that was perfect for Bill
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.320]  because he was so non-threatening and so good at like dealing with other human beings um
[42:46.840 --> 42:51.480]  was that he needed to Deutsche Bank one of the many problems the bank had in these days
[42:51.480 --> 42:57.560]  was that they had like in each german city so like not just like Berlin and Frankfurt but like
[42:58.280 --> 43:04.360]  like Stuttgart and like Monheim and i'm just making shit up at this point but there's they each
[43:04.360 --> 43:11.560]  are cities yeah you're not making them up i am actually german do you know that i do um so i
[43:11.560 --> 43:17.480]  i'm a german citizen so that's why i call you enrique and not enrich uh you americanized your
[43:17.480 --> 43:26.760]  name ellis island americanized uh uh anyway all of these places had their only little bond trading
[43:26.760 --> 43:33.880]  outposts there's no coordinated uh strategy no mechanism and so bill was in charge of doing that
[43:34.440 --> 43:39.240]  organizing the bond traders or of pulling all this power into london away from sovereignty
[43:39.240 --> 43:44.120]  and the way bill described it at the time was the the situation that he was set out to fix was
[43:44.120 --> 43:50.200]  quote the sort of thing that produced duplication of effort and dissipation of energies um which i
[43:50.200 --> 43:58.600]  just love because it's you know yeah it's just it's bill yeah um he succeeded in that and things
[43:58.600 --> 44:07.800]  are starting to click and he by uh you know in a year or two being at the bank um the customers
[44:07.800 --> 44:13.960]  seem to be responding to all the changes they're making and he felt like this was finally the
[44:13.960 --> 44:25.240]  moment where deutch a bank it was real and uh let's say they bought a mercedes which is interesting
[44:25.240 --> 44:30.600]  because not long ago they had been very opposed to anything german very opposed to mercedes um i
[44:30.600 --> 44:37.400]  thought that was interesting too um a conversation uh my dad eventually said oh carries it was years
[44:37.400 --> 44:43.880]  ago they're not out to get us and then my mom was like yes no big deal it's my mom was more opposed
[44:43.880 --> 44:50.920]  to mercedes and my dad should we pause remember i'm extremely hungry yeah okay
