1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
going okay great okay so we were just getting into your parent your arrival in

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,840
the United States and so 1982 Ola and Alexander get divorced yeah you go to

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:23,880
live with your dad yeah and then I go through some of the frankly like awful

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,400
memories you have so we've got you him your dad taking you to a horror movie and

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,920
you were so scared to be puked in the aisle Halloween what was hell oh that

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,560
was the movie okay we've got your dad collapsing on the floor yeah frothing at

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,600
the mouth like what the fuck was it and then we've got you guys ending up in

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,880
the selection army homeless shelter and it which we've found together in those

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,640
documents you got from Cook County and it one hot day in May of 1982 the juvenile

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,960
court takes custody and it you know I'm just quoting from the court filing

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,440
saying that you're neglected and that the miners parent does not provide the care

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,440
necessary for the miners while being citing the mental and or physical

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,440
disability of the parent noting that the court tried to track down your mom even

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,920
running a newspaper ad in Chicago Sun-Times unsuccessfully and it turned

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,520
out that she was staying in her mother's apartment which is just like a few miles

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:38,760
away and so off you go into foster care which is like I'm not just doing this

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,400
with a camera but it's that like on the scale of the pain associated with your

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,440
dad's death which is worse like how does that come how does that these memories

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,960
compare to that memory I mean well these memories are few and far between but

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,400
they're not pleasant yeah I can't even imagine

21
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:14,960
okay so now we switch back a bit to Bill's narrative and it he goes to

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,120
Northwestern he goes to business school Northwestern did you exempt all this

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,560
speculation about my mom yes okay should we say it for fun it's not necessary

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,320
um man that fun

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,720
okay so he gets a job that by the way was that shank I'm not since I'm not using

26
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,520
that one good it was it was like one of the people that was in his circle at the

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,480
time college friends I can't remember if the guy went to college I remember it was

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,140
just in that circle okay I mean he said it on the record but I'm just since we're

29
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:02,040
not you said it on the right yet was it verified by anyone else no okay um let's

30
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,080
see okay so he graduated from business school gets a job of continental Illinois

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,080
which is one of the biggest banks in the country at the time and this is where he

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,240
really gets in derivatives and it's a blah blah blah I spent with derivatives are

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:25,360
81 this is let's see what year is this yeah this is 81 or 82 and so this time

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,320
derivatives were pretty much a sleepy tool used by a few banks by this it was it

35
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,520
was like becoming a kind of an expanding lucrative niche for lots of banks like

36
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,160
mortgages no it was well they were starting to one of your dad's

37
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,120
innovations and I'll look kind of getting out of order here and that's fine

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,320
okay was well let's just wait actually I'll go through it and of it so one day

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,840
your dad it's actually a little unclear exactly where your parents met but

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,480
there's the leading theory that I've heard it's a party what was that I can

41
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,000
always know the story of the party what I've heard from more people is that he

42
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,000
went into the Stanley Corsac store for some reason and met her I think this is

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,280
after this party maybe that's the way I remember the story you see you remember

44
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,280
the story being that they met like at a mutual friend's party yeah okay and then

45
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,480
you went to see her at the store a few times oh that's interesting so okay well

46
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:38,120
in any case the they became a couple they got engaged in 1983 and in March of

47
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:46,400
1984 Reverend Jack officiated their wedding so we go through some more of

48
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,160
your like not very pleasant foster care memories here which we don't need to do

49
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,480
unless you want to which ones I want to okay sure I'm happy to if you want to

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,360
sure okay so and we talked about this a little bit yesterday there's this

51
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,160
wonderful photo of you and your dad together in the I guess in the social

52
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,600
workers place and you know you seated together on the carpet and there's a

53
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,200
game and I just physically describe you guys and there's like a big pile the

54
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,040
brown leather jacket on an orange sofa and a small pile of black and white

55
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,880
photos that I guess you guys were looking at together maybe back from your

56
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:32,680
time in Ukraine but a picture of him on a it's really tank right he sent that to

57
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,880
you didn't wasn't that was after he disappeared that wasn't I think so yeah

58
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,240
I mean my memory is foggy yeah yeah and then he had sent me a photo of him on a

59
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,000
tank and a toy tank and a canteen Israeli canteen like a army canteen right but

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:05,160
that was after he disappeared I think so so there's another very painful memory

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,200
about you're in the basement of the social workers office with a bunch of

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,560
other kids you're bickering over the rules of connect for yes the door at the

63
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:21,180
top of the stairs opens all the kids stop what they're doing someone's name is

64
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,560
gonna get called and that means their parents are there for a visit and you're

65
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,760
not just a visit to take yeah your your name gets called you run up the stairs

66
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,600
your mom's gonna be there maybe she's gonna take you home and it's not your

67
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,200
mom it's Helen the social worker and she's there to inform me that you're

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,920
being assigned to a new family did you talk to her no I didn't I don't even know

69
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,280
she's still alive yeah this is a long time ago

70
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,160
I remember her she was in very nice it's kind of short long blonde hair nice voice

71
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,000
Midwestern very kind person

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,760
okay and she would take me from one home to the other whenever leave one she'd

73
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,900
always take me and drive me I remember always stopping McDonald's cuz I love

74
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,720
McDonald's he doesn't love McDonald's at that age every kid yeah yes she was very

75
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,040
nice get some more water but yeah go on sorry okay so we kind of shift gears a

76
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:35,120
little bit here for a while that stuff's not related to you guys so in

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:49,440
early 1984 Edson hires Bill at Merrill and yeah which is right as continental

78
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,520
Illinois is about to collapse so it's fortuitous time so he was poached yeah

79
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:02,080
he was hot Edson hired that's an idea so how did Edson meet him they that's a

80
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,400
little unclear actually how they met they were both working in Chicago banking

81
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:15,760
for a while they're both at Connell no Edson was at Bank of America okay anyway

82
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:24,560
your parents moved to Short Hills so it doesn't want to know about two pots are

83
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,400
sick I know it's okay just to give her a quick text I'm just we can just keep it

84
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,720
rolling okay um don't make you go on yeah she says a casual pizza place or

85
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,560
something more upscale like manual at LA what do you do mine I mean what do you

86
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,600
want to do is it nice yeah they're paying and let's it's unhappiness ours by

87
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:58,320
house in words yeah yeah is it would be open run seven

88
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:19,440
no oh yeah yeah she's gonna do it yeah great okay okay it sounds fine so I'm

89
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,680
accustomed to dealing with no I did I want to meet him but yeah get rid of

90
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:46,960
him I'm curious to meet him okay wait there wait hang on hang on they're gonna

91
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,640
pay for this I don't know they haven't said we're paying so should I just say are

92
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,640
you paying yeah yeah say if you're paying that sounds great with like a

93
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:06,520
smiley okay yeah I'm assuming you're paying smiley yeah or Roseanne is

94
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:17,440
depends he's paying I'm not coming from oh I see that's when he takes me to a

95
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,680
restaurant it's always like Donald well we're just talking about the reality is

96
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:30,360
always looking down smiley face sounds great depends he's paying exclamation

97
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:37,520
smiley face sometimes just a lot easier to write smiley face than to actually go

98
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,600
find the emoji for smiley face David I are working right now I'll just let her

99
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,840
know I'll just stay she's okay all right let's keep going here okay so shortly

100
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,400
after they arrive in Short Hills they decide that they want you yeah and it

101
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,880
takes a while but by Thanksgiving of 1985 all is granted custody of you you're

102
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,920
nine years old by this time I thought that was 1984 it's 1985 she initiated

103
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,760
proceeding in 1984 but it was not until 1985 that she got you back those fall of

104
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:24,120
85 yes Thanksgiving and it so I'll look at some counseling at the request of

105
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,640
Jersey social services and it gets the family you guys get a caseworker who

106
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,960
comes and visits and the caseworker notes that you have lots of toys in a

107
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,120
very nice bedroom and what you want you tend to get and that you're having it's

108
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,200
caseworker said what I want to get not in those words but yeah that you get lots

109
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,400
of material possessions however you're having it's taking a while for you to

110
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,440
get like to open up emotionally to your parents understandably you're starting to

111
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,960
give hugs and kisses but you're also insisting on calling them by their

112
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,960
first names your parents quote C Val is testing their authority and commitment

113
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,320
to him she noted at one point when quote when confronted with a parental

114
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,040
demand Val tons ask why and repeatedly asked the question to every

115
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,920
explanation offered Bill grumbled to the caseworker that you quote occasionally

116
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,400
cut corners in the completion of tasks but the caseworker says happily that

117
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,040
the difficulties encountered have been dealt with adequately and with

118
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,800
increasing skill for all concerned the predominant attitude is that of

119
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,600
optimism remember having to call it so many people dad so it's like everyone

120
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,560
wants me to call them dad and that's interesting yeah so what do you mean the

121
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,200
foster family yeah every foster family it's like call me dad okay you're not my

122
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,760
dad but we want you to call us me dad and her mom so he's always dad and mom

123
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,120
and every time it just it gets to be too much after three homes so yeah so after

124
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,120
yeah I remember my mom saying you have to call him dad call him dad okay dad dad

125
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,600
so he just sort of got into the you know the pattern of doing so but yeah I

126
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:22,240
remember that was a big issue it's these notes that the case worker left I mean

127
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,280
when you go through foster homes every foster family wants you to call them mom

128
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,920
or dad for in my case so it's just it's very awkward to have to do that and once

129
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,600
you get comfortable calling someone dad then you're going to another home you

130
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,040
have to call someone else mom and dad and as a kid it's very confusing yeah I

131
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,880
can't even imagine and then you sort of let it go after a while okay this is mom

132
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,800
and dad and you don't think about it but then every time you're taken out and

133
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,440
put into a new situation it's you know and look I yeah I mean and I think it's

134
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,660
probably completely normal that yeah reunited with your mom and the

135
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,720
stranger who you've never met before like you're not in the middle of my dad I

136
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,320
mean we sat in the back of a Volvo in Chicago when he told me that we were

137
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,400
gonna move to New Jersey and he was getting married to my mom and what I

138
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,960
thought about it well you didn't really ask now I don't think that's right

139
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,600
because I remember this is a gas station because my mom went to go to the gas

140
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,800
station and I was in the car and that's my dad took the time to talk to me so you

141
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,240
met him in Chicago yeah because you were still in foster care and they had

142
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,280
moved to New Jersey before you were out of foster care yeah so it must have just

143
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,160
been for a visit I suspect that they were there interesting okay that's good and

144
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,720
we went out and there was a couple times we went to Maine and I flew for

145
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,880
Thanksgiving that might have been the year before 1984 where they took me from

146
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,320
foster care to Maine for Thanksgiving and then I met all those bad whole family

147
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,680
there and then I went back to foster care I remember this okay that's good I

148
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:00,160
didn't I didn't know that okay so Bill at work

149
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,960
he is Merrill is like just out of control in those days coke in the

150
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,960
bathrooms strippers on the trading floor and your dad by those standards is a

151
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,680
complete nerd coke on the bathrooms in the Maryland yeah yeah that sounds about

152
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,440
yeah not that your dad was partaking but the answer he was really of course I

153
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,640
don't know that it's not the impression other colleagues had of him at the time

154
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,000
and he was described as a very nerdy kind of flabby and unathletic the last guy

155
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
you picked for a sports team maybe not at work but maybe afterward there's the

156
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,640
stuff about you know he twirls his pen when he's nervous which I also do and the

157
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,800
eyebrow tugging which is everyone who you told me about

158
00:15:50,240 --> 00:16:01,640
let's see but look he's just like a he's kind of math skills bordering on the

159
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:08,440
savant and brilliant and yeah it's a great method for multiplying three

160
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,160
digit numbers I remember I can't remember his should remember it but I was

161
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,800
trying to explain it to you once a year ago you know you have like a 367 times

162
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,360
492 the way you broke it down and do it in your head was brilliant that's crazy

163
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,880
I've realized not that long ago that I have actually no idea how to do like

164
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,080
multiplication like that anymore yeah no I did back in school they like yeah

165
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,240
division either yeah division is terrible so I have confidence finance

166
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,320
editor of the New York Times baby it's okay so he became not only like the math

167
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,560
wiz around there but was very he was kind of like a creative engineer and was

168
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,680
cooking up all these new types of derivatives that and back in this is

169
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,280
kind of like a transitional point in the finance industry at this point where

170
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,440
derivatives originally were conceived of I know you know but as a way for like

171
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,640
businesses to protect themselves against risks like interest rates change in or

172
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,840
dairy price if you're an ice cream company you know you want to hedge against

173
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,320
yeah exactly and but this is a point where they were also becoming like

174
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,160
gambling devices basically and so yeah at this point yeah they were credit

175
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,200
derivatives I mean credit derivative no not stuff like of that major but like

176
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,360
gambling version well interest rate swaps which were the one of the things

177
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,080
that your dad really pioneered worse in the they're in the infancy insurance

178
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,240
against against well that's what I'm saying it was it was both right I mean

179
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,880
the swamps were very good for clients and that's kind of the way your dad

180
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,360
manufactured them and the purpose they had but they were also the reason this

181
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,960
became such a lucrative business on Walter is in part there was a lot of

182
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,400
trading going on around them and so your dad when people realize that you can

183
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,640
make you can make money on these on the bets against bats yeah exactly huge

184
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,960
thing right so I've got a bunch of people here talking about the role your dad

185
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,600
played just how creative he was like what an instrumental role he played one

186
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,960
of his colleagues from back in the day who I'm not naming in this but he's a

187
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,720
guy who rose to the very top of Wall Street yeah says quote because of people

188
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,440
like Bill but maybe none more so than Bill the derivatives business went

189
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,560
mainstream in usage for investors as well as corporations financial

190
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,040
institutions and government agencies so he was really in the development of the

191
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,440
swaps market what your dad pioneered was one of the very most important things

192
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:48,720
that changed the finance industry over the past 40 years so Edson loved it

193
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,760
making a lot of money he and your dad actually once sat for an interview

194
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,280
together with the Chicago Caribbean this is in 1992 and they've got it's kind of

195
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,160
hilarious because Edson you know gregarious and charismatic is like such

196
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,640
a character yeah just palette Edson such a character you just kind of you know

197
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,360
like hamming it up kind of with the reporter and like all these kind of

198
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,160
like nice quotes very smooth and then your dad says his quote is we simulate

199
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,920
40 interest rates in yours every night it is a brute force simulated hedging

200
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,800
strategy it's a just like you know it's such a nerd yeah he plays a straight guy

201
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,280
to Edson yeah he plays a straight guy to Edson's Joker Laurel Hardy sort of

202
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,080
that's a good way of thinking about it and they're becoming as you know like

203
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,800
really good friends and the fan like you know that's it was a great great guy I

204
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,000
don't tell you I'm sure I told you I'm like everyone tells me that it's a great

205
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,480
great guy someone told me this anecdote I mean let's not get into the Edson

206
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,720
stuff he's that's just gonna derail us here oh no it's here it value it's two

207
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
o'clock right now yeah and we've been doing this for like an hour and a half

208
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,120
and a lot of time we're on page 28 right now everything else secondary to this

209
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,680
we're on page 28 of a 350 page book okay so if we continue at this pace we can

210
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:19,280
cancel dinner I mean it's fine just keep going I want everything Edson is you

211
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,080
know who Edson is your dad let's talk about how you how you have processed the

212
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:32,520
he is charismatic he is he is someone charismatic gregarious impulsive and needs

213
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,080
someone by his side to reign him in absolutely and who is that person that's my dad correct

214
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,360
and a lot of things say your dad apart and obviously his math skills the kind of

215
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,160
innovations with derivatives but one of the biggest things is that he is like

216
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,000
he's not a threat to people and he knows how to ask questions and he really wants

217
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,680
the answers he doesn't want to trick you he's got very correct yeah and he's got an

218
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,160
ability to listen also to hear but Edson are my dad your dad yeah okay there's

219
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,720
which is not the norm on wall street right like there's this is a place

220
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,280
while it's like filled everyone's trying to bulldoze well it's like well it's either that

221
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,400
it's like the it's kind of the kind of vaguely sociopathic personalities sure and it's these

222
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,480
socially maldraught like math nerds right who can't and your dad fits someone in between

223
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:25,480
yes exactly he's an early quant yeah but he he had human skills he didn't and that's normally

224
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,720
a lot of the quants are kind of like mildly on the spectrum and I don't well well you know you've

225
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:40,920
worked with a you know Tom or Todd Tom Tom um uh everyone in banking wants to make money but

226
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,000
there are different degrees of avarice one of Bill's colleagues and friends would explain

227
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,840
Bill was on the low end of that spectrum yeah um uh um there's a great anecdote

228
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,760
this isn't really involving well it is there's a guy named John Bright who is a particle

229
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,160
physicist at Merrill well he's a risk manager at Merrill he is a particle physicist by training

230
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,520
okay so Merrill was higher okay uh well they were they're higher in creating a halogen collider

231
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:18,040
thankfully no um but he was a risk manager and he was obviously very smart and he routinely would

232
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,400
say tell Edson's traders no we can't do that for this or that reason right and Edson would just

233
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:30,120
lose this shit and just erupt and we're like we'll fire you and Bill repeatedly would intervene

234
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,320
and save his job and say that's his job no no it would save John Bright so the risk manager who's

235
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,080
about to lose his job he's Edson's angry that the guy want to prove the trades his team wants to do

236
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,280
Bill intervenes and protects him saying that he's right um uh

237
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,440
talk a little bit about the Russian-Turkish baths and um vacation together in Maine

238
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,360
yeah he loved us but that place the baths yeah um and in Maine he told because he lived in

239
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,160
Rangeley and he bought a place down the street right in Brooklyn right yeah and Edson's kids

240
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:10,920
your parents is kind of a cool cultured couple uh in part because Allah seemed to derive pleasure

241
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,800
from tormenting Bill just kind of playfully uh I mean I don't know how playful that was uh

242
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:27,400
maybe um uh let's see Allah converts from Judaism to become Protestant yeah

243
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,280
for the parties she threw parties for the party oh for the parties well she would also throw

244
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:40,520
parties and she threw a great party she always was very good at that um people who went to some

245
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,880
of the parties would say that each time they went there they would notice that the dining room seemed

246
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:52,120
to have changed colors yeah and there's another party where um my mom's a very gifted interior

247
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,040
yeah she I mean that's what there's one party that she specifically put gold leaf all over the

248
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:07,640
ceilings uh which made quite an impression um okay so you at this time are having some troubles

249
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:16,680
it sounds like um the one person described how you had it I mean there were just stories going

250
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,560
around about what had happened to your actual your birth father right and you had told someone that

251
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,160
you had discovered him dead of a drug overdose again this isn't like you're in like fifth grade

252
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:33,080
not dead this is the way this person remembers it um uh there's a point in also in fifth grade

253
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,560
where you briefly ran away from home as this person recalls it this is one of your friends

254
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:47,160
in fifth grade yeah Pat um Patrick Gorman yeah he's got it all wrong okay does he what happened

255
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,360
I never ran away from home what's he referring to and I never saw my father dead of a drug overdose

256
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,520
so I he's referring to no no he's not saying no this wasn't just Pat by the way this is someone

257
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,600
else as well there's um it doesn't matter let's I know it's important I mean I never ran away from

258
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,160
home um what's he referring to he's referring to when I was going to be sent to Rocky Mountain

259
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,800
Academy then I thought we had a plan of uh breaking me driving to Florida to live at my

260
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:21,640
friend's Florida house and stealing the car and driving all the way to Florida but it was just

261
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,600
a bunch of talk and no one never did anything and instead I got on the plane the next day and went to

262
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:33,080
the SUWS in Idaho and then from there I went to Rocky Mountain Academy he's saying this is in

263
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,040
fifth grade though and that was not until like your what junior and senior year of high school yeah

264
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,920
this is much later he's saying this is happening in fifth grade yep I ran away from home in fifth

265
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:49,080
grade I mean not for like a long time but like there is he just got his brief um he ran away to

266
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,000
my friend's house possibly to spend the night there it's not a deal let's move on that was

267
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,280
strange um and um and I remember you back I'm recounting the wonderful tale of you your dad

268
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:11,000
taking you to work at Merrill and you were about 12 and uh he's introducing you around and one of

269
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,080
poor colleagues comes up and says oh I could see the resemblance that was funny and my dad I looked

270
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,360
at each other and just laughed yeah that's what he and and Bill told the colleague there was an

271
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,880
inside joke and tried to kind of make him feel better about himself um and um and so

272
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,880
so okay um

273
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,720
I've talked to a number of people who perceived

274
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:53,080
feel like they noticed at the time uh that there was much more warmth from your dad to your sisters

275
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:00,360
than to you okay um my sisters or babies or kids well this is by the time we are getting a little

276
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:07,720
bit older at this point um uh I don't have a specific year but this was probably when you were

277
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,200
like 12 or 13 or so yeah my sisters were yeah they were young they were there's a lot of warmth to

278
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,000
my sisters when you're kids and babies and children there was everyone had warmth to them

279
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,360
yeah everyone has warmth toward little kids I agree yeah um you can't uh

280
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:33,480
I'm not making much effort I'm saying I'm trying to qualify warmth from the 13 year old son to two

281
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,960
two babies it's very it's a very strange statement that someone would make at that

282
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,600
a couple of people made that statement anyway there's it's a perception thing right and like

283
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,640
it's not necessarily a right perception or a wrong perception okay so you're at 13 if I've

284
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,800
got this right you were sent to Dublin school is that right um yeah okay uh and you were kicked out

285
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:02,600
after a while for smoking yes and having weed is that the first time I was kicked out for smoking

286
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:11,480
on the charlotte's right and then the second time I was kicked out for smoking weed yeah okay um

287
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:23,480
and um and you all the time had like asked and that weed came from uh the writer what's his

288
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:30,760
fucking name again this is blank the other writer that's always pg o rork pg o rork's weed yes

289
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,840
um he grew it in his in his backyard in uh peterborough or let's see a joining town

290
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,960
exit Dublin I think it's peterborough that's where he lives okay for some reason he liked to have

291
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,960
high school kids hang out at his house and smoke weed it's a very strange guy yeah that's strange

292
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,760
yeah it's very strange okay so um

293
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,480
during this time you kind of periodically asked like why you had been in foster care yeah and

294
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,080
what I've got here is in particular your grandmother so all his mother yeah giving these kind of like

295
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,800
vague and not very convincing explanations about something about drinking bad milk yeah

296
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,120
something about your birth father's hospital I remember I went to the hospital um and my

297
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,920
grandmother we said it was from drinking bad milk and I remember being in this cage because

298
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,600
I was a kid so they had to put you in a crib but the crib had a top on it and that was like the

299
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,880
most claustrophobic crazy thing ever and I'm like screaming and yelling trying to get out of this

300
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,480
fucking cage and the nurses would come in and open up the top like I could breathe again it was just

301
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,840
terrible that sounds terrible it was terrible it was really bad I remember I think that's where

302
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,200
my this is before or after foster care this is during foster care wow at some point I don't

303
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,800
know why I had to go to the hospital and my grandmother said it was some bad milk I think

304
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,360
it was related to the time my father and I don't know what I mean I've always been told it's an

305
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,160
overdose but I don't know for sure if that was it's still the truth but again I get contradicting

306
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,600
stories right constantly um but I do remember being in the hospital what did your mom say

307
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,520
when you would ask her why you've been in foster care um she said it was my father was a drug addict

308
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:27,560
he's a terrible person and she was a great person and why did she then not get you out of foster

309
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:37,240
care yes sorry no definable no answer that's the sticks okay and they're they're always changing

310
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,000
to like when I was a kid it would be one thing when I got older was another thing so okay so you

311
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,360
then get sent off to Rocky Mountain Academy for your junior and senior years yeah and the high

312
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:57,640
school and the and the sophomore junior and senior yeah oh these are three years I thought

313
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:08,200
well it's like the second half of sophomore okay um uh so while you're there one of your classmates

314
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:18,440
is this guy this kid John Avila John Avila yeah um who is kind of a dork that people you know

315
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,680
did you describe the school yeah I described this I just the school is crazy it's crazy yeah um

316
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,080
uh but one day in 1994 and again this isn't even from you know you told me the story originally

317
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:38,440
but I verified this through um just their local news articles at the time uh how do you say it

318
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:46,600
Avila uh John Avila okay he uses a belt to hang himself from a pipe in his dorm room yeah and it

319
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:52,920
my dorm room that was actually your room uh yes that's my dorm room and I became the

320
00:31:52,920 --> 00:32:00,520
dorm head like the guy in charge of the the dorm afterwards okay I'll move back in there um yeah

321
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,720
sorry no no no sorry no I became it was my dorm room after so when they for a month no one lived

322
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,400
in that in that dorm and then when they allowed people to move back in I was the one living in

323
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:17,880
there in the the dorm head of that okay this is called Camelot the name of the dorm is Camelot I

324
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,160
remember um yeah see I hung myself from the belt I had been living in a different dorm okay to that

325
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,240
um and anyway that obviously was like not uh that was a scarring experience and you

326
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,240
found yourself for years thinking about that and that was the end of that school

327
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,520
yeah from right back from that point when that suicide happened it took down the school

328
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,560
it did not right away it didn't that was there is 2002 yeah but it was a slow climb and that yeah

329
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:53,480
I mean that was yeah eight years later um it and then other incidents appeared to right yeah okay so um

330
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,960
then we get into the whole Orange County debacle right and your dad's role in it which is kind of a

331
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,880
seminal moment for him because he turned him into a superstar yeah it turned him and it kind of

332
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,320
created the legend of Bill yeah um and I don't think we need to go through that right now you know

333
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,960
that story this is like the story is what you know it to be did you find a copy of the memo yeah okay

334
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,000
um and okay all sorts of history about Deutsche Bank which we're not going to go through right now

335
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,600
one of the last things my dad was asking uh in December uh or fall of 2013 was if I had to copy

336
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,040
that memo because he wanted it and I sent it to him oh that's interesting yeah I was like why do you

337
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,440
want to say because he was going to start looking for new stuff and he wanted to copy the memo to

338
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,880
send to some employers or somebody for some some reason yeah I haven't actually found a copy of the

339
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,520
memo what I found or like there's like substantial excerpts of it yeah that were published at the

340
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:59,960
time in like the LA Times I'll see if I can find the full memo for you again um but yeah um okay and

341
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:07,240
that memo saved Merrill well that memo actually hurt Merrill in a sense because I did Merrill from

342
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,720
no it showed that it actually he was the opposite of that right it was like it showed Bill doing the

343
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,120
right thing yeah very much but Merrill disregarded his vice no no no Merrill way understood it was

344
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:26,600
that Merrill the Orange County said uh Merrill it'll advise them yes and my dad said uh this you know

345
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,400
Orange County don't do this deal don't do the trade yeah and on advice of Merrill because he

346
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,400
represented Merrill no that's not quite right the so Merrill had the West Coast sales team that was

347
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:44,200
selling all this shit to Orange County and it Bill and John Bright the risk manager the particle

348
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,240
physicist I mentioned earlier got we're getting very nervous about this and so and no one would

349
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,000
really listen and so Bill sat down and wrote this long memo showed it to Edson Edson signed the memo

350
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,800
and then they sent it far and wide in Merrill Merrill there's like a bit of a civil war inside

351
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,000
Merrill that's overstating a bit of a tug of war inside Merrill they disregarded it ultimately

352
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,320
and kept selling even more and that worked for another year yes okay and so the fact that Merrill

353
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,440
had known that this is really risky right actually hurt them but that's like definitely not your dad's

354
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,480
fault that's well the your dad can come out of that in suit in one of the case yeah they have billions

355
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,080
of dollars so or they're sued for billions not sure they should got it okay so Edson

356
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:33,720
got hired at Deutsche Bank I had confused it in my head you're right Edson got hired at Deutsche

357
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:41,480
in 95 first thing he does is well he hired a bunch of people there well they retired first

358
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,520
what do you mean they both retired Edson and my dad had retired first Edson didn't retire first

359
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,240
I think he did no I mean I've got the chronology pretty solidly from people around him he he got

360
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,320
the job offer he took a helicopter at Princeton in Jersey where there's a retreat from Merrill

361
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,520
and told him I'm done give me the helicopter back to New York oh really he went to lunch that day

362
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:15,320
and I didn't know that interesting so Edson's first person he wants to hire is your dad

363
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,960
he doesn't do that well your dad says no and I'll get to why in a second he ends up hiring

364
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,640
kind of a small clique of people from Merrill one of whom one is Cassie Cabetti yeah do you

365
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,240
know Cassie yeah I do and who's a comedian okay another is Michael Phillip I don't know if you

366
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:45,800
ever crossed paths with him I don't remember Michael and another is Anshu Anshu so Bill said no

367
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,320
and Cassie's a brilliant guy too yeah I know and had a supermodel for a wife for a while yeah

368
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,960
so Bill said no part of it is that like it seemed like Edson was taking this huge risk

369
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,440
another part of it a big part was the Orange County mess was still playing out

370
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,000
who said no what was that who said no Bill said no your father said no I'm not kind of with you

371
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,880
Edson and the Orange County mess was still playing out in the legal system and in the press

372
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,880
and your dad wanted to stay at Merrill to help clean it up the biggest thing though is that he

373
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:28,520
was tired and which is a little unusual for a 40-year-old investment banker to admit to but

374
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,160
he wanted a break and so he announced he got in agreement with Merrill in March of 96

375
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,000
that he was retiring or taking a paid leave of absence Merrill's public statement at the time was

376
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,960
that he was leaving to spend more time with his family which is typically like a euphemism for

377
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,600
someone resigning in disgrace but in your dad's case it was actually true one little bit of hilarity

378
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:59,400
that I love is that when Bill rebuffed Edson Edson you know like the normal the normal thing to do

379
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,520
that situation is you know beg and plead and then if he says no okay see you later dude right uh

380
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,200
instead Edson enlisted Bill to interview job candidates on his behalf for jobs at Deutsche

381
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Bank for even though even though Bill was his competitor right and Bill did it yeah and I've

382
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,920
talked to a couple of people who he interviewed and is like he was that's funny he's a good job

383
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,000
and candidate interviewer Edson's way to get him to take the job so yeah well the way to get him to

384
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,600
take the job that I want you to have the way that he got him to take the job was they were both families

385
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:38,760
were in Maine a few months later so a few months after Bill retires in March of 96 and Bill is still

386
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,920
saying no no no no although he'd missed the adrenaline on Wall Street uh the issue of working

387
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:52,040
for a German bank was kind of unpalatable for the Brooksman family given what uh you know the role

388
00:38:52,040 --> 00:39:02,520
that Nazis had played in there in their lives and um so Edson figured out a way to convince Bill

389
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,600
and do you want to guess what that way was what was it he dangled a lot of money in Ola's face

390
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:15,480
oh my mom speaks very clever uh so he basically said how much money your dad could expect to make

391
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,560
and then he walked away and let Ola do the rest and she did and she pushed and pushed and pushed

392
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:30,840
and so in November of 96 so that's about let's see that's eight months after he retired from

393
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:39,080
Errol he and Ola and the girls moved to London you're in college at the time so you stay in the

394
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:50,920
States um and immediately they get taken out to dinner by Edson and Susan right and uh the recollection

395
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,800
of someone who's at a dinner is that Ola complained the whole time that Bill had refused to splurge

396
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:10,200
on business class tickets um okay so you're at Albright college um Matt Goldsboro recounted for

397
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:18,440
me the tale of you guys uh your little heist of uh the band room or the music room uh which um

398
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:26,120
Matt thought was pretty badass to quote him um and you were also the guy who became known

399
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,480
for you know trying to make girl get girls to make out with each other three in the morning

400
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:38,040
and find some coca three in the morning and uh not in a bad way people said this with admiration um

401
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:47,400
do you remember the your samurai sword yes oh i love that sword um says someone told me the

402
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:55,480
anecdote of how you the like RA was trying to get you to turn the music down like in the middle of

403
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:02,520
the night and you wouldn't and a football player got involved like threatened you and you went into

404
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:09,240
a room and emerged in a black cape with a samurai sword and said they're trying to kill the funk

405
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:16,520
whoever wants to kill the funk is going to have to kill me first uh so um yes wonderful college

406
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:23,960
days yeah god only knows what else we both have uh lurking in our college exactly um

407
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,720
to intrude upon your college when i do some research on you yeah let's not that happened with me uh

408
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,360
during the Kavanaugh hearings we had written some stories about Brett Kavanaugh and in his

409
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:40,200
i read them all yeah and someone on twitter like came after me oh one of my college classmates came

410
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,920
after me saying and rich i remember i read that like you one day like puked in my bathroom and

411
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,880
he didn't clean it up and he didn't even ask for it i was like it's a very strange thing to i know

412
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:59,000
it's actually one with yeah it was it was strange uh okay as if that was going to derail your

413
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,000
comments on Brett Kavanaugh uh man very strange uh

414
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:12,840
so you guys are Deutsche Bank you guys are Deutsche Bank uh edson's a Deutsche Bank the team is a

415
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:22,920
Deutsche Bank one of bill's tasks assigned by edson uh was to try and pry power away from Germany

416
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,760
in the markets business um and which market well so edson was running the entire global

417
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,040
markets business and your dad was a co-head of proprietary trading specializing in credit derivatives

418
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:40,200
and credit yeah so but he his job and this is kind of a thankless job that was perfect for Bill

419
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,320
because he was so non-threatening and so good at like dealing with other human beings um

420
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,480
was that he needed to Deutsche Bank one of the many problems the bank had in these days

421
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,560
was that they had like in each german city so like not just like Berlin and Frankfurt but like

422
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,360
like Stuttgart and like Monheim and i'm just making shit up at this point but there's they each

423
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:11,560
are cities yeah you're not making them up i am actually german do you know that i do um so i

424
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,480
i'm a german citizen so that's why i call you enrique and not enrich uh you americanized your

425
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:26,760
name ellis island americanized uh uh anyway all of these places had their only little bond trading

426
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:33,880
outposts there's no coordinated uh strategy no mechanism and so bill was in charge of doing that

427
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,240
organizing the bond traders or of pulling all this power into london away from sovereignty

428
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,120
and the way bill described it at the time was the the situation that he was set out to fix was

429
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,200
quote the sort of thing that produced duplication of effort and dissipation of energies um which i

430
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:58,600
just love because it's you know yeah it's just it's bill yeah um he succeeded in that and things

431
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:07,800
are starting to click and he by uh you know in a year or two being at the bank um the customers

432
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,960
seem to be responding to all the changes they're making and he felt like this was finally the

433
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:25,240
moment where deutch a bank it was real and uh let's say they bought a mercedes which is interesting

434
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,600
because not long ago they had been very opposed to anything german very opposed to mercedes um i

435
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:37,400
thought that was interesting too um a conversation uh my dad eventually said oh carries it was years

436
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,880
ago they're not out to get us and then my mom was like yes no big deal it's my mom was more opposed

437
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:50,920
to mercedes and my dad should we pause remember i'm extremely hungry yeah okay
