0	7760	cigarettes in town. And then you're stuck at the campground because your mom's credit card is
7760	18240	basically toast. And you're out of money because Avis has stolen or whatever. So at the campground
19120	24560	you're playing gigs there to earn your keep essentially? Yeah they said not to earn my keep,
24560	31280	just sort of. I had nothing else to do and they said look you can stay here and we'll run a tab for
31280	36160	you you know but we're going to have to move you out of the nice cabin and put you into the safari
36160	41760	tents in this other other. So you're staying in a tent? Yeah staying in a tent. It's like a you
41760	47360	know there's sort of big safari tents you see. Like on a platform? Yeah yeah I should have to
47440	54800	so many pictures. I'll show you some more. And it's like bunk beds inside this tent and so I had
54800	61840	the whole thing to myself and it was at the further reach of the campgrounds. And yes I would play
61840	65840	during the day I would just because I had nothing else to do so I just played music but it wasn't
65840	70160	earning my keep but in the sense they're sick well you know just keep playing and then we'll
70160	74960	do this for you. You can eat for free at the cafe and you can live in this tent until you get this
74960	79200	thing solved with Avis because I explained to them the whole thing and why I was here I showed
79200	84560	them the air post thing they understood okay this is Val's you know not trying to rob us here this
84560	91280	is a legitimate thing they saw the the tape on the car they saw the broken glass before and after
91280	95440	they saw the police report which is written in fucking Dutch so and they were all Dutch people
95440	99680	so they understood the police report so they all were kind of on my side and they're very good
100000	104640	people they're very nice people that ran that place you at the camper that's where you meet Julie
104640	109280	that's where I meet Julie yeah she's 24 at the time she's taking her class in Amsterdam yeah
110160	116800	her father had died in 2015 from her heart attack yeah and she says to me we shared the madness of
116800	123600	death uh that's very Julie and I also know that you also shared lots of mushrooms yes we did um
124400	126400	okay
127440	133760	I believe they're called truffles now, psilocybin truffles, truffles yeah because you can't in
133760	139440	Amsterdam legally sell mushrooms psilocybin mushrooms so they sell psilocybin truffles
140160	147840	it's just like a work around the law the same thing okay um you at this point I think find
147840	151920	another credit card in your mom's email yeah basically enables you to get back on the road
151920	156400	exactly and so you're at the camper and you make contact with David Rossi or sorry with a lawyer
156400	160160	for the winner it's a little more dramatic than that I escaped fleeing boats on the cover of night
160160	166160	because my stay was no longer accepted it was I overstayed my welcome did you put this in the
166160	172400	book too yeah I did not I overstayed my welcome and I was getting moved from the safari tent and
172400	177920	then when there was a bunch of Scottish kids coming in for some EDM concert they asked me to sleep in
177920	181920	the back of the car with the broken window and still had glass in the back because I didn't
181920	186800	want to touch anything for the insurance people in case avis actually fucking showed up I spend my
186800	192960	days on the reason why and this is important because this this is a really long story but I'm
192960	200880	going to do my best to summarize um is that I they had one phone I could not top up my phone
200880	205200	because I couldn't I was negative $15,000 in my accounts I could not top up my phone I could
205200	209200	not make a phone call I could use their wifi and the reason you're $15,000 negative is because
209200	213280	avis is basically charging for the price of a new car yes they charge me for the price of a new
213280	218320	fucking car and it took me a very long time and I was only allowed like a two hour period during
218320	222960	the day to use their house phone and that's what I would spend the days calling avis trying to get
222960	227440	figure out what's going on just from customer service person to customer service person six
227440	233680	weeks later okay I'm still working on it but I had I had managed to escape because they were
233760	237360	getting tired of me I overstayed my welcome I find that hard to believe
238240	244320	fuck you fucker um no but I I mean when they moved me and they said you have to sleep in your car
244320	250160	now it's that's what I knew like okay this is I've overstayed my welcome I got a guy it's avis is
250160	254880	still dragging their feet they haven't done anything they sent me from customer service agent
254880	260400	customer service agent nothing's been done I met Julie I'm like okay I'm just going to escape with
260400	266400	Julie and they had why did you do a skate because legan bus held on to my passport and my guitar
266400	271760	because then you I would go nowhere without my my why did they want to have anything in case in case
271760	277120	I left without paying the bill that I had oh so you had a bill I had a bill they gave me like a half
277120	281040	price for everything but they were still charging me for the food because I had to stay I had to
281040	287120	eat something yeah so I had how big was the bill it was about 2500 euros at the end of it which is
287120	290640	half price for everything yeah they did I mean they're still very kind and that was a very good
290640	295680	deal for what they gave me which was they let me live so wait why let me stay like they wouldn't
295680	300720	let me be homeless and I was very kind of but I had could not pay that 2500 dollar bill and no matter
300720	305760	even when I found the other credit card I tried so hard online to pay this with them and they could
305760	311120	not accept the digits it was chip and pin only and I was like come on please just plug in it's like I
311120	315520	love to believe me we want to get you out here and pay this no we don't care where you got this
315520	321520	number we believe you but we cannot do it without the chip it's like a law in in this in Amsterdam
321520	325680	so I went online they try and do it online they would not accept the card because it was not
325680	329600	an international card it was an American card they wouldn't accept it in the fleeing boat so I'm like
329600	333920	can you just change your fucking online payment system like that we don't know anything about it
333920	338880	we hired a tech company to do it we can't do it I tried so hard to pay them with with my mom's credit
338880	347600	card so I had no other choice when they when I was uh uh what's the word not so educated
348160	352640	regulated or when I was moved to the back of my car with the broken glass relegated relegated to the
352640	358160	back of the car broken glass with the fucking sleeping bag and you had to leave they had held
358160	362720	on to my fender strat they knew I would go nowhere without the fender strat and my passport
362720	368400	which I obviously would not go anyway my passport so over the weekends the security was very
368400	375120	lax days ago and there was this really great guy who's like a uh it used to be like a children's
375120	379440	clown for a long time and then something happened in his life he lost all his money his wife and
379440	384560	now he's a security guard for fleeing boats really nice guy I talk him into giving me my guitar
384560	388880	and that saturday night he says oh I just want to play it let me just keep in the car I'm sleeping
388880	393840	in the car right here I'm not going where it's out of course here's your guitar Sunday night
393840	398400	there's another guy who's a real dick he was a one it was a writer he was a terrible writer
398400	404400	really bad it was a dutch guy trying to cliches everywhere like he was asking everyone to read
404400	409920	his books and they're fucking terrible and so I talk him and I told him my story he wanted to
409920	412720	oh this is a really interesting story you should do I was like I don't want to hear your fucking
412720	416720	advice for my story but I talk him into giving me my passport because I said I want to buy some

454960	462000	do you make contact with uh luka garachi is that at the campground while I was living in the tent
462000	469120	yeah okay that's where I'm at yeah okay so um I quote you emailing him saying maybe I can help
469120	472480	maybe we can help each other and perhaps also help other families of those who've suffered
472480	481200	for all this misery yeah um he invites you to come to sienna yeah um you do so in early august
482000	488400	by then you've got an outing now right no no sorry it's a white BMW convertible yeah but that's
488400	493360	an a whole nother story because again after six weeks I get into I get into steinberger this is
493360	498560	where I check into the steinberger wait sorry hang on first there was the dorms Julie and I went to
498560	504000	the dorm when I got the credit card working and I'm like you know fucking haven't showered and God
504000	510240	knows how long I look like shit I got the beard and I got this 24 year old hot German girl with me
510880	517200	walking in with guitars in my hand and you know a bunch of and and no credit card again it's it
517200	522960	wasn't easy but all I had was memorized 15 digits of my mom's fucking american express I don't have
523040	528720	security code I had the expiration date so four more digits and I walk in there and I just
528720	533360	fucking talk them into letting me stay on this credit card and it was not easy and Julie was
533360	538480	very surprised that it worked I was like wow I can do this this is a steinberger no this is a
538480	542400	different this is at the dormant and then I did the same exact thing at the steinberger
542400	548240	okay don't you got booked we booked the biggest fucking suite possible and got the whole spa
548240	552560	package at the dormant and Julie and I would just relax for a bit it was just nice to have a
552560	559360	fucking campground have a little bit of civilization you know and we just fucked and had a good time
560080	565040	and went to the pool and saw it as it was just nice to get out of that fucking situation and then
565040	570000	they were booked um and I couldn't renew the suite and I didn't want to get one of those shitty fucking
571680	575040	so I didn't you know whatever I didn't want to live in a city where I just lived in a fucking
575760	580400	so then I go to steinberger and I stay there for about six more weeks and still dealing with
580400	585440	avis they still have not refining the money or or giving me a new car or done anything and this is
585440	590080	where the tab what I've got the tab this is where Julie gets a brilliant idea is to email the board
590080	595840	of directors at avis so just get the fucking call the ceo if you can like you're fucking right and I
595840	602240	go to like ceoemails.com there is a website to ceoemails.com and I find every board member on avis
602240	607600	and I send them all a fucking email like I'm stuck here get me out of this fucking thing it's been
607600	612640	six weeks fuck all you and then finally I get one of the board members gets back to me and that's
612640	616880	how they send out the specialist and remember I say in emails do you mean the specialist that
616880	622160	guy's fucking nuts the guy flies out from London to Paris to deal with this and he goes to the
622160	627760	headquarters in the stand bowl and he's still keeping me you know fucking with me this whole time
627760	631920	he says what we're gonna do is gonna swap out your car we're gonna give you a new car and after
632960	638640	that's how fucking long it is I think it's six weeks or sorry it was actually five weeks of
638640	643760	league and boasts and then it was another month at Steigenbreder the guy's finally swaps out the
643760	649440	car and it was a BMW convertible right a two-seater which is completely inappropriate for what I need
649440	653200	because I had so many bags and guitars at that point and I showed you the pictures where it all
653200	658560	just popping out of the fucking car I couldn't believe it and they said and and I had to talk
658640	662640	him say well we need a working credit card you can't use a debit card I said well you know I'm
662640	667360	negative 15,000 because of you fuckers on my debit card so I couldn't use that anyway and I
667360	671120	don't have a working credit card I said well you can't so we can't swap out this card because
671120	676720	officially we need a credit card number it's like okay I've got a family card that we can use I've
676720	682000	just called my family's private banker and I just played it out like I'm this you know this special
682000	686400	rich person with private bankers call the private banks they they've authorized the use of this
686400	692480	credit card it has my family name on it um it's actually a brooksmit family card you know I didn't
692480	696560	say a la brooksmit I said brooksmit family card I'm obviously Val as you know we've been talking
696560	700400	to each other say I'm not supposed to do this it's getting in trouble it's like look man
701600	706160	you know I just gave him a whole fucking charm spiel the best I could do is say fine okay just
706160	712320	use the card so I gave him that those 16 digits again sorry in the expiration code they put it
712320	718960	on my mom's card and I was finally free and then I could go to Siena I checked out at Steigenberger
718960	725920	and I went to Julie moved from her student housing into this beautifully lovely dilapidated
725920	731280	squat with all these other girls and that was fucking great so we lived in this squat with her
731280	735520	and her friends and that was fucking fun and I'd moved all my shit in there and use that as my
735520	741600	home base point for that for the next trip to Siena okay left the guitars and all this shit in there
741600	748080	and then I went to Siena but I stopped in Berlin first before no no I'm sorry I went to Siena first
748080	755920	and then Berlin but we'll get there okay so in Siena your and the whole the whole trip now
755920	764480	is funded by me walking in with guitars being the the exotic American with 16 digits pretending that
764480	768720	this is all I don't know anything about money all I know is they said you can use this card
768800	773520	okay Mr. Berksman yes of course and I got cash by by saying you know I don't know if you guys
773520	777840	still do this oh well we don't really give cash against the room anymore it wasn't you know like
777840	782000	I'm a bit of a trouble here I'm not quite sure what to do and then the bank rates and the exchange
782000	786240	rates are just terrible I'm losing so much money on these exchange rates like oh yes they are quite
786240	790240	terrible we can give you a better rate actually here but it's actually a nominal commission
790240	794800	charge okay let me let me get 500 euros against the card like of course Mr. Berksman and so I would
794800	800000	do like every other day get 500 euros and that's how we'd amass enough cash to get through it this
800000	809920	the next adventure um okay so after spending $10,000 a month on each hotel and the DAS stew is
809920	815520	probably my favorite of all of them the which one the DAS stew in Berlin is the greatest hotel

1201680	1207360	he said I can't mind I'm staying at the hotel now directly across the yep I've got that yep um
1207360	1216160	it uh it's two level sweet and a duplex duplex with frescoed ceiling yeah it's beautiful um
1217440	1222160	I've stayed in a hotel near there actually it's uh with also a frescoed ceiling yeah yeah
1222160	1225680	which one I don't remember it's years ago um
1233360	1237040	okay so you offered a hired translator he says no the stuff we're talking about is too sensitive
1237120	1241360	to have a stranger he instead invites you for lunch the next day and his two daughters would
1241360	1246240	translate but did you put in keep in mind that this david rossi's story is like the oj simpson
1246240	1256480	story of sienna yes yes it's huge so that's why he was so paranoid um okay so you come next day
1257680	1261840	and he paints this kind of sordid picture of the corrupt relationship between doigcha and
1261840	1267760	monnie deposky talks about how faisola knew or should have known that these guys were up to no
1267760	1274000	good it talks about the monnie deposky's connections to the mob and corrupt local politicians and
1274000	1282560	that was complete open secret uh he told you the lawyer told you that rossi had been mixed up in
1282560	1289040	some bad stuff himself renting a car once a month and driving to switzerland to logano yeah to logano
1289040	1294960	to put cash and secret bank accounts for like local mobsters basically you know including uh one
1294960	1301360	cardinal scurrano and vatican if chief uh about a vatican financial officer yeah okay it was the
1301360	1307680	chief one but and so you're taking notes and like really intrigued by in fact he showed me these
1307680	1312560	notes yeah i still got them in the suitcase do you want me to pull them on no that's okay um
1316560	1323200	and it 13 pages of notes no you've showed them we we went over this last time i was here um
1325040	1333680	so um the way you explained this to me the last one i talked about this is which was a year ago
1333680	1338560	was that this was like really intriguing but you were also like a little bit jealous about it in
1338560	1343360	some ways like it was so simple it was obviously very complicated but like it seemed like rossi
1343360	1348320	had been murdered yeah right he like felt the window backwards those two guys approach yeah going back
1348320	1354480	to David Gray showing me this right yeah exactly and that is like much easier to understand in a
1354480	1360480	way even though it's complicated than what your dad did absolutely yeah um which is why i like this
1360480	1367280	theory but of course you like the theory that your dad was murdered you're extorted they're
1367280	1376880	forced to kill himself right this is my leading theory at the time okay okay so he gives you a
1376880	1385280	bunch of documents uh luca garachi and you leave tuscany yeah with tuscany and sienna well sienna's
1385280	1391040	in tuscany sorry okay tuscany's like the region yeah well more specifically it leaves yeah but
1391040	1395520	fine i can eat tuscany because it's tuscany it sounds a little broad in general it's like
1395520	1401920	it's about now with the tuscany because if you go to tuscany you go to tuscany well sienna is a tuscan
1401920	1406720	hilltown okay fine i don't have to figure about it but i it's now you don't want to figure about it
1406720	1412160	i mean it's it's it's it's it's move it's move you want to figure um i i'm going to tuscany like
1412160	1422480	we're in tuscany i'm going to okay okay okay i gotta do it uh um but but but but let's see so i'm
1422480	1432400	tuscany no um but florida's tuscany oh i don't think so i think florida's south it's really
1432400	1437200	further south i'm pretty sure i'm not plugging the internet here but if you really care it's easy
1437200	1445680	enough to look up uh find the bicker yeah okay so so okay you and i might need a little help with
1445680	1452880	the chronology here so you leave sienna yeah you go to germany i go to berlin you go to you go to
1452880	1458320	germany this tells me to get in touch with mort's enders okay well just hang on hang on a second
1458320	1463520	so you and julie reconnected this point she is an apartment in nuremberg that she's their sister
1463520	1470240	right yeah not yet not yet though i first goes to uh berlin uh to meet morris and then after that
1470240	1476160	i'm meeting sorry who's morris mort's mort's mort's who's he so he's the the german filmmaker
1476160	1480720	right okay yeah yeah i did that german thing and now he's at the dossier and that's where i spent
1480720	1486240	all that money and time in the dossier in berlin okay um and we shoot the documentary there for a
1486240	1490960	couple days about uh what i learned from david rossi because luke put me in touch with him he said
1490960	1494720	here's a film maker that's interested in the story i think you should speak to morris i called morris
1494720	1501440	he said meet me right away in berlin so go to berlin hang with morris wait i'm not this doesn't
1501440	1507600	actually matter i can tell by the picture it doesn't even matter to me what i want so i might i might
1507600	1512880	go and see julie first i don't remember it doesn't matter you go to germany you do some shit then you
1512880	1519440	and julie drive to nuremberg and on your way to nuremberg you stop in frankfurt yes right which you
1519440	1523680	you've never been to frankfurt never been to frankfurt okay and so you and julie are standing
1523680	1530720	outside the deutch event towers yeah and staring up at it and you told her that up there the guys
1530720	1537680	are responsible for your dad's death yeah and that she felt like a she could sense your visceral anger
1537680	1544480	and actually found that was scary yeah okay good we're set i don't need she also thought of being
1544480	1549760	followed all the time by this folks wagon some guy because we always saw the same license plate
1549760	1554240	around the steigenberger hotel i remember this and it's this there's this guy in the
1554240	1557760	fucking boats wagon the same license plate we keep passing him the highway all the time
1557760	1565440	he's asking about that okay um okay so we're gonna fast forward a little bit okay you end up in
1565440	1573520	prog julie's exited yeah see you guys the relationship kind of ended over a fight over money
1573520	1579280	no no she had a she was going on with some other girl she had a she met somebody else
1580400	1586080	and she didn't tell you that did she no she didn't uh but she did tell me there was a big a huge
1586080	1592880	fight over money that yeah no because i used her i had to use her account to get money from america
1592880	1598400	but it wasn't a fight over money it was because she was seeing some other girl she had a fair
1598400	1604640	with some girl and that's why i didn't it's like the fuck you i'm not going back to to to perler
1604640	1610160	to apsham and she said okay well whatever but you can still use my account because i still use her
1610160	1615760	account okay and then she had done some and i have all the documents i'm gonna i'm definitely i sent
1615760	1621040	you the bank statement i'm not at all interested in she took out a bunch of money that i had put in
1622080	1626400	and then when i cleared my money out because i got i got snow it's it's important because i got
1626400	1630640	stuck in prog and that's when all the credit cards were cancelled i'm on frozen yeah and we're
1630640	1639760	about to get into that so the um so you enjoy the breakup yes and you're in prog you're translating
1639760	1645200	money to posky documents yeah you're sharing them with a bunch of journalists yeah there's like a
1645200	1651120	small flurry of stories and other media about yeah this stuff that you've been planted um
1651200	1659680	um this is when i've got the view switch to oxy um i actually did that in amsterdam uh so when i
1659680	1668000	first before the car was uh uh someone had stolen the computer from the car i had seen a doctor and
1668000	1672960	started on about 20 milligrams he gave me like 30 20 milligram pills of oxy because i was still
1672960	1679280	kind of detoxing from france as decoding was you know harder to get in amsterdam and hamsters
1679280	1684480	hamster and get anything else why am i dealing with over the counter code code even i'm fucking
1684480	1690240	in amsterdam so i go i find a doctor who describes whatever you want because me oxy i run out of that
1690240	1697920	while i'm at uh league and bows and i switched to opium poppies so there's you can buy just dried
1697920	1703280	opium poppies you crush them up pour hot water on it let it sit for a couple minutes and you drink
1703280	1709440	opium tea and it's fucking glorious it's glorious and that got me through a lot of misery when i had
1709440	1714640	no money but you can always get the opium poppies for like a euro you know you can borrow a fucking
1714640	1720880	european somebody get 20 of them it's dirt cheap and it just was great um and then when i finally got
1720880	1724800	cash again that i went to the doctor it was in nuremberg it was a great doctor to prescribe me
1724800	1729840	80 milligrams like 200 tablets for two weeks okay so what i've got is that by the time you're in
1729920	1734480	prog you're it got me through it got me through it's you're doing about 10
1735360	1741120	80 milligram pills a day no not in prog that was in france when it got to france i was up to 10
1741840	1748480	so how many what were you doing in prog um i'd say uh about half that five maybe six a day okay
1748480	1754480	five yeah um
1757600	1764640	i've never done that or is that like an addiction at that point or is it what is an addiction is
1764640	1770720	a habit it's not like a habit you know i mean but what happens if you stop taking it i don't know
1770720	1774720	there's many different people who give you well what's your experience a theory between
1774720	1780400	addiction and habit but yeah i mean i could stop if i didn't want to you know and i was forced to
1780400	1786560	a few times so i mean went off and on them um but it was just easier than buying off the streets
1786560	1791920	the doctors would give it to you you know you're getting you know it's reliable makes you happy
1791920	1796560	get through the day i'm not miserable i've got this described here as an addiction is that do you
1796560	1806640	think that's unfair no it's not unfair um i would say more you know uh tool but um okay i mean it's
1806640	1812640	the opiate addiction right i mean all i know that is what i read and it's like obviously extremely
1812640	1817440	addictive well i mean i think about just think about alcohol in terms of alcohol yeah but it's
1817440	1822080	a lot more addictive than alcohol isn't it it depends on the person then okay fair enough so
1822080	1826960	hate oxycodone some people love alcohol they hate all other drugs but yeah okay you know some people
1826960	1834240	hate and i'm the other the flip side of that yeah um okay so september 2016 you go to a
1834240	1841440	vote-of-fun store to get a new sim card and guess what happens in prog yes okay so your turn i got
1841440	1848160	pulled over by the interval people remember i tell me tell me the license plate number i went to sleep
1848160	1855680	in uh somewhere between nuremberg and prog and i had already been pulled over for a speeding
1855680	1862080	through a checkpoint when i was going to lugano and they took my passport i told them that i was a
1862080	1866800	journalist and i was doing a story on montia pasca and i showed them all the documents i had
1866800	1871520	etc etc and they they bought my story and they said okay well just don't go through fast these
1871520	1875760	checkpoints and how long you've been in this country by the way let's go back and forth it's
1875760	1880560	like well you need proper visa to be to be staying here longer than three weeks so it's okay i'll
1880560	1884560	coming back through again i said well you can't come back through again it's the thing you have to
1884560	1888880	actually you know i didn't pay attention to them i just kept going back through the they're all
1888880	1895200	shagging countries you're supposed to be allowed to do this i don't understand the issue um but and
1895200	1901200	then i at this last point that we're talking about now i'm going to prog i pull over at like a rest stop
1901200	1906800	during the day to just sleep in the car and snore a couple more of the oxys and just because i was
1906800	1912560	fucking exhausted um and i wake up and there's they're knocking that well actually i wake up i
1912560	1918560	saw them pull in i was already up i was listening to some podcast Neil deGrasse Tyson this fucking
1918560	1923440	podcast was getting through all this shit it was it's a good podcast um and the car pulls in
1923440	1929280	in front of me and it's another bmw and that just it's like an undercover copper i don't know how
1929280	1935600	they do it in germany or in interpol um and this sort of short-stop guy comes out and this sort of
1935600	1943200	tallish elderly or older blonde woman uh the woman can speak english the other guy cannot and he's
1943200	1950560	carrying a gun and they've got official documents saying that they're uh with interpol and but in
1950560	1956800	conjunction with uh a german something that bnd here i don't know whatever german state
1957440	1961280	running agencies and they're one of what i'm doing here why i keep going over the
1961280	1964640	the border so many times can't there's so many times can they search my car
1965360	1970240	i'm like dude i'm just a guy you know i'm a journalist i'm trying to figure out the story
1970240	1973440	because i don't want to talk about my dad so i just it's just easier to say i'm a journalist at
1973440	1978720	this point it's my cover it's like you know i'm just i can show you all what i'm working on here's
1979680	1985200	here's search me on the internet so i i am who i am here's my passport
1985200	1990400	do nothing wrong um they say well you've been going over the border waits many times you
1990400	1994720	cannot come back to germany unless you get a proper visa and they say can we search your car
1994720	1999440	and i'm like well you can but take a look and i do the old the shirt from the electric
1999440	2006320	electric gulet acid test if you remember tom wolf and when neil castley gets pulled over by a uh
2007040	2012960	uh a cop anywhere in america he keeps the back of his car does a filthy fucking mess and he says
2013520	2018000	my license is somewhere in the back of his car officer please uh let me just find it for you
2018000	2022720	might take some time and he just keeps pretending to look for the license until they give up so i
2022720	2027120	say well yes of course you know i have all my travel documents and visa stuff and everything's
2027120	2032800	available right here somewhere in my luggage and they see the luggage piled up as you've seen piled
2032800	2038320	up beyond the convertible roof and then i pretend to start opening up from the trunk and i start
2038320	2043760	looking for oh no i've got everything right here you know i've got the press uh pass i think it's
2043760	2048880	just lied my ass up and they just sort of sat there and watched the the older guy was just new
2048880	2053200	ass full of shit but you couldn't really do anything and the woman they got some call about
2053200	2058240	something else and he heard them talking german and they said okay look just get a fucking visa
2058240	2062000	next time you're through here and they just wanted to verify and they didn't ask me if i
2062080	2066160	drugs in the car and i said i did and i have prescription for them and i showed them prescription
2066160	2072880	i got from the doctor in urnberg and that was enough for them at that point okay and then i cross
2072880	2078560	over and there's no there's no passport check to get into prod at that point right so you are
2078560	2083280	supposed to have a visa to be in the EU you don't you're a european citizens don't need visas to
2083280	2087600	travel between countries but americans after three months and i'd been there well over three months
2087600	2095920	at this point yeah okay so shakin or tushkin what's the word it's i can't even maybe it's shakin
2095920	2101760	it's the it's the treaty that allows open borders between european countries so okay anyway you're
2101760	2107440	in prog so yeah 2016 yeah you go to the vote upon story you get a sim card come back to your the
2107440	2112320	bmw convertible life cigarette prepare to drive away and all of a sudden out of nowhere comes this
2112320	2116960	hulking dude and asks what you do yeah and i remember feeling that there was something wrong
2116960	2122800	with that day as soon as i got into that that fucking that mall is like a check a mall in check
2122800	2128720	and then prod it's very strange just looking for a vodafone and i felt like i was being followed
2128720	2134960	and i remember larry saying be careful and like god damn it i don't see you know i can't my skills
2134960	2139360	aren't that good to pick up on being followed and i don't want to live in this fucking paranoid world
2139360	2143520	that larry wants me to live in so like i'm not being followed not being followed but just the fact
2143840	2147840	that thought popped into my head at that specific time this means my instincts were up
2147840	2151760	and the alarms were going off and i probably should have listened to them but i just pretended
2151760	2156480	that it was my own paranoia and i don't really know what you could have done about it it's like
2156480	2161280	there's like that guy was like following the guy i mean i don't know he for some reason he waited
2161280	2167840	till i got into the car um right there so okay and you know where his car was it was parked right
2167840	2175840	across from mine you know so okay so as this guy's attacking you and obviously i've seen the video so
2175840	2182160	there's uh the thing that keeps flashing through your mind is that this is deutcha that sent someone
2182160	2188160	to finally kill you no not deutcha the the mafia because of the everything i learned from luca
2188160	2193920	about montian poskey and the calibria mafia calibria mafia i thought this is a mafia fucker
2193920	2199200	because he was italian and it just came from fucking i've been spending all my time translating
2199200	2204960	by hand pdf documents that were scanned from montian poskey david rossi's emails and just the
2204960	2209520	antevented to deal everything that he gave me you've seen it thousands and thousands of fucking pages
2209520	2213760	so i've got italian mafia in my head i just have been to legano to try and get the search
2213760	2219760	of your money looking at the at the banks that have david rossi was dropping these his bags of
2219760	2225200	cash off so i'm thinking mafia mafia mafia here's an italian doesn't speak a word pulling me out of
2225200	2230880	my fucking car i thought i was gonna die i really thought i was gonna die it's terrible and i'm so
2230880	2238240	stupid because i had bought for uh just for the show a uh in urmberg you can buy like a pellet gun
2238240	2242960	it looks exactly like a proper gun and i had that in the glove compartment and had i brought it out
2242960	2246080	maybe the guy would have run away i don't know yeah or maybe he would have shot you or maybe
2246080	2250480	he would have shot me but all i could think of was use the phone so it's the best weapon i have is
2250480	2258080	this phone um okay so please come in the video recording of the phone right of course the um
2259520	2265120	and it remained a miracle to me that you both videoed it and we're smoking a cigarette and
2265120	2274640	we're fighting this guy it's impressive thank you very well coordinated um okay so it turns out
2274640	2282080	obviously after uh dealing with the cops this guy's not an assassin yeah he is a repo man repo
2282080	2288240	man and he gets your car he gets the car and you did at that point in fact owe abis a lot of money
2288800	2294640	no they still owe me 15 grand they had not given me anything right but they but so put that aside
2294640	2300640	they you owed them for this bmw like you hadn't been paying you'd had this now for a few months
2300640	2306160	yes and because they had told me they this was free this car was now free because of all this
2306160	2311600	shit that because i did not charge it i i was well but i was looking for lawyers to the best i could
2311600	2317440	but no one would represent me for free against avis so their thing was you can have this car for
2317440	2321840	free but you have to return it to france you know and they say you can have it for a month
2321840	2325360	i'm like okay great but i kept it longer than a month because i was like fuck you avis and keep
2325440	2329760	as long as i fucking want after what you did to me and that was how that worked out for you it did
2329760	2334000	well and you know how it worked out for me but that was the thing and then it wasn't i didn't
2334000	2338800	owe them any money they still owed me money right since i went back to berlin that they gave me half
2338800	2346240	of that back half of it okay so seven thousand okay so now you owe me fucking five grand okay so

2385440	2389600	ultimately and the police drove me back to the holiday right okay i stayed in there
2389600	2394480	just highs how this might i was defeated it was feeling terrible i'm just watching netflix
2394480	2398560	trying to write my story because the whole purpose of going to prog was to write my story
2399600	2404000	you know everything that's happened up to this point couldn't outright shit and started hacking
2404000	2410800	more into my mom's uh my mom's files to see if i can find more credit cards at this point
2411600	2418560	i found one that i was still usable and i checked myself into a nicer hotel i can't remember the
2418560	2423920	name of it in downtown or sort of center downtown center prog by where they all did
2425040	2431680	like a staple center equivalency uh a prog rather than the you know the businessmen go for their
2431920	2437680	businessmen things you know the auditoriums and big speeches and shit and i got a great
2437680	2445680	suite there and then in the middle of that stay my mom froze her credit and then they were trying to
2445680	2449680	charge me for room service and they said we haven't been able to charge her the last few days you know
2449680	2455680	you owe us this much money like yeah the cards cancels like are you serious let me call the bankers
2455680	2459680	if i know what's wrong right away and like well we're gonna have to escort you to the room ask
2459680	2465680	you to leave if you can't pay this right now i was like okay well what can i pay so i get all the
2465680	2471600	money that i had masked uh by taking cash out against the rooms which is i had a bunch of cash but
2471600	2477120	i think it was about 3,500 euros i owed and plus i had julie's account that i had money coming into
2477120	2484560	from america from vju which is about 25 to 2,800 a month and from that i took out what i put in
2484560	2490160	exactly what i put in julie unbeknownst to me had already been taking money out of that account
2490160	2494560	that i had put in so i was like fucking julie is like well you know what i owe her she's letting me use
2494560	2498800	her her bank accounts she had to do is a joint account it had my name on it i had a card with
2498800	2503120	my name on it as well and julie had her own so i was pissed off that she was taking money out of
2503120	2509120	this account but i had enough to cover the 3,500 i owe this place but i didn't know what to do about
2509120	2513840	going to a new place so that's why i went to an airbnb and started using airbnb i've never used
2514160	2517760	airbnb in my life and i should have been doing it the whole time because you can get
2517760	2522720	fucking great value especially in prog and that's why i started going to airbnb and using
2522720	2528000	the money i had left i transferred to a new account i did a new td bank account online
2528720	2533920	from prog and put money instead of going to julie's account cancelled that and put it back into my
2533920	2541280	account in my name from td bank okay that's how i started so i lived on 2,500 a month at that point
2541280	2548320	in airbnb okay we're gonna pause okay just break this up yeah
