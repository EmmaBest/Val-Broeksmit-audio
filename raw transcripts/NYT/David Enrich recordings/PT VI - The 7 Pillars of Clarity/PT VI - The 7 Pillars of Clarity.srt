1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
cigarettes in town. And then you're stuck at the campground because your mom's credit card is

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:18,240
basically toast. And you're out of money because Avis has stolen or whatever. So at the campground

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,560
you're playing gigs there to earn your keep essentially? Yeah they said not to earn my keep,

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,280
just sort of. I had nothing else to do and they said look you can stay here and we'll run a tab for

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,160
you you know but we're going to have to move you out of the nice cabin and put you into the safari

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,760
tents in this other other. So you're staying in a tent? Yeah staying in a tent. It's like a you

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,360
know there's sort of big safari tents you see. Like on a platform? Yeah yeah I should have to

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,800
so many pictures. I'll show you some more. And it's like bunk beds inside this tent and so I had

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,840
the whole thing to myself and it was at the further reach of the campgrounds. And yes I would play

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,840
during the day I would just because I had nothing else to do so I just played music but it wasn't

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,160
earning my keep but in the sense they're sick well you know just keep playing and then we'll

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,960
do this for you. You can eat for free at the cafe and you can live in this tent until you get this

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,200
thing solved with Avis because I explained to them the whole thing and why I was here I showed

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,560
them the air post thing they understood okay this is Val's you know not trying to rob us here this

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,280
is a legitimate thing they saw the the tape on the car they saw the broken glass before and after

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,440
they saw the police report which is written in fucking Dutch so and they were all Dutch people

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,680
so they understood the police report so they all were kind of on my side and they're very good

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
people they're very nice people that ran that place you at the camper that's where you meet Julie

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
that's where I meet Julie yeah she's 24 at the time she's taking her class in Amsterdam yeah

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,800
her father had died in 2015 from her heart attack yeah and she says to me we shared the madness of

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,600
death uh that's very Julie and I also know that you also shared lots of mushrooms yes we did um

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
okay

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,760
I believe they're called truffles now, psilocybin truffles, truffles yeah because you can't in

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,440
Amsterdam legally sell mushrooms psilocybin mushrooms so they sell psilocybin truffles

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,840
it's just like a work around the law the same thing okay um you at this point I think find

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
another credit card in your mom's email yeah basically enables you to get back on the road

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,400
exactly and so you're at the camper and you make contact with David Rossi or sorry with a lawyer

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,160
for the winner it's a little more dramatic than that I escaped fleeing boats on the cover of night

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,160
because my stay was no longer accepted it was I overstayed my welcome did you put this in the

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,400
book too yeah I did not I overstayed my welcome and I was getting moved from the safari tent and

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,920
then when there was a bunch of Scottish kids coming in for some EDM concert they asked me to sleep in

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
the back of the car with the broken window and still had glass in the back because I didn't

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,800
want to touch anything for the insurance people in case avis actually fucking showed up I spend my

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,960
days on the reason why and this is important because this this is a really long story but I'm

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:20,880
going to do my best to summarize um is that I they had one phone I could not top up my phone

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,200
because I couldn't I was negative $15,000 in my accounts I could not top up my phone I could

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
not make a phone call I could use their wifi and the reason you're $15,000 negative is because

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,280
avis is basically charging for the price of a new car yes they charge me for the price of a new

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,320
fucking car and it took me a very long time and I was only allowed like a two hour period during

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,960
the day to use their house phone and that's what I would spend the days calling avis trying to get

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,440
figure out what's going on just from customer service person to customer service person six

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,680
weeks later okay I'm still working on it but I had I had managed to escape because they were

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
getting tired of me I overstayed my welcome I find that hard to believe

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,320
fuck you fucker um no but I I mean when they moved me and they said you have to sleep in your car

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,160
now it's that's what I knew like okay this is I've overstayed my welcome I got a guy it's avis is

46
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,880
still dragging their feet they haven't done anything they sent me from customer service agent

47
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,400
customer service agent nothing's been done I met Julie I'm like okay I'm just going to escape with

48
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Julie and they had why did you do a skate because legan bus held on to my passport and my guitar

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,760
because then you I would go nowhere without my my why did they want to have anything in case in case

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,120
I left without paying the bill that I had oh so you had a bill I had a bill they gave me like a half

51
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,040
price for everything but they were still charging me for the food because I had to stay I had to

52
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,120
eat something yeah so I had how big was the bill it was about 2500 euros at the end of it which is

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,640
half price for everything yeah they did I mean they're still very kind and that was a very good

54
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,680
deal for what they gave me which was they let me live so wait why let me stay like they wouldn't

55
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,720
let me be homeless and I was very kind of but I had could not pay that 2500 dollar bill and no matter

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,760
even when I found the other credit card I tried so hard online to pay this with them and they could

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,120
not accept the digits it was chip and pin only and I was like come on please just plug in it's like I

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,520
love to believe me we want to get you out here and pay this no we don't care where you got this

59
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,520
number we believe you but we cannot do it without the chip it's like a law in in this in Amsterdam

60
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,680
so I went online they try and do it online they would not accept the card because it was not

61
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
an international card it was an American card they wouldn't accept it in the fleeing boat so I'm like

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,920
can you just change your fucking online payment system like that we don't know anything about it

63
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,880
we hired a tech company to do it we can't do it I tried so hard to pay them with with my mom's credit

64
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:47,600
card so I had no other choice when they when I was uh uh what's the word not so educated

65
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,640
regulated or when I was moved to the back of my car with the broken glass relegated relegated to the

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,160
back of the car broken glass with the fucking sleeping bag and you had to leave they had held

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,720
on to my fender strat they knew I would go nowhere without the fender strat and my passport

68
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,400
which I obviously would not go anyway my passport so over the weekends the security was very

69
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,120
lax days ago and there was this really great guy who's like a uh it used to be like a children's

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,360
an a whole nother story because again after six weeks I get into I get into steinberger this is

92
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,560
where I check into the steinberger wait sorry hang on first there was the dorms Julie and I went to

93
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,000
the dorm when I got the credit card working and I'm like you know fucking haven't showered and God

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,240
knows how long I look like shit I got the beard and I got this 24 year old hot German girl with me

95
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,200
walking in with guitars in my hand and you know a bunch of and and no credit card again it's it

96
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,960
wasn't easy but all I had was memorized 15 digits of my mom's fucking american express I don't have

97
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,720
security code I had the expiration date so four more digits and I walk in there and I just

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
fucking talk them into letting me stay on this credit card and it was not easy and Julie was

99
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,480
very surprised that it worked I was like wow I can do this this is a steinberger no this is a

100
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,400
different this is at the dormant and then I did the same exact thing at the steinberger

101
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,240
okay don't you got booked we booked the biggest fucking suite possible and got the whole spa

102
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
package at the dormant and Julie and I would just relax for a bit it was just nice to have a

103
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,360
fucking campground have a little bit of civilization you know and we just fucked and had a good time

104
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,040
and went to the pool and saw it as it was just nice to get out of that fucking situation and then

105
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,000
they were booked um and I couldn't renew the suite and I didn't want to get one of those shitty fucking

106
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,040
so I didn't you know whatever I didn't want to live in a city where I just lived in a fucking

107
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,400
so then I go to steinberger and I stay there for about six more weeks and still dealing with

108
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,440
avis they still have not refining the money or or giving me a new car or done anything and this is

109
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,080
where the tab what I've got the tab this is where Julie gets a brilliant idea is to email the board

110
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,840
of directors at avis so just get the fucking call the ceo if you can like you're fucking right and I

111
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,240
go to like ceoemails.com there is a website to ceoemails.com and I find every board member on avis

112
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,600
and I send them all a fucking email like I'm stuck here get me out of this fucking thing it's been

113
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,640
six weeks fuck all you and then finally I get one of the board members gets back to me and that's

114
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,880
how they send out the specialist and remember I say in emails do you mean the specialist that

115
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,160
guy's fucking nuts the guy flies out from London to Paris to deal with this and he goes to the

116
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,760
headquarters in the stand bowl and he's still keeping me you know fucking with me this whole time

117
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,920
he says what we're gonna do is gonna swap out your car we're gonna give you a new car and after

118
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,640
that's how fucking long it is I think it's six weeks or sorry it was actually five weeks of

119
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,760
league and boasts and then it was another month at Steigenbreder the guy's finally swaps out the

120
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,440
car and it was a BMW convertible right a two-seater which is completely inappropriate for what I need

121
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,200
because I had so many bags and guitars at that point and I showed you the pictures where it all

122
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,560
just popping out of the fucking car I couldn't believe it and they said and and I had to talk

123
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
him say well we need a working credit card you can't use a debit card I said well you know I'm

124
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,360
negative 15,000 because of you fuckers on my debit card so I couldn't use that anyway and I

125
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
don't have a working credit card I said well you can't so we can't swap out this card because

126
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,720
officially we need a credit card number it's like okay I've got a family card that we can use I've

127
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,000
just called my family's private banker and I just played it out like I'm this you know this special

128
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,400
rich person with private bankers call the private banks they they've authorized the use of this

129
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,480
credit card it has my family name on it um it's actually a brooksmit family card you know I didn't

130
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,560
say a la brooksmit I said brooksmit family card I'm obviously Val as you know we've been talking

131
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,400
to each other say I'm not supposed to do this it's getting in trouble it's like look man

132
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,160
you know I just gave him a whole fucking charm spiel the best I could do is say fine okay just

133
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,320
use the card so I gave him that those 16 digits again sorry in the expiration code they put it

134
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,960
on my mom's card and I was finally free and then I could go to Siena I checked out at Steigenberger

135
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,920
and I went to Julie moved from her student housing into this beautifully lovely dilapidated

136
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,280
squat with all these other girls and that was fucking great so we lived in this squat with her

137
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,520
and her friends and that was fucking fun and I'd moved all my shit in there and use that as my

138
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,600
home base point for that for the next trip to Siena okay left the guitars and all this shit in there

139
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,080
and then I went to Siena but I stopped in Berlin first before no no I'm sorry I went to Siena first

140
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,920
and then Berlin but we'll get there okay so in Siena your and the whole the whole trip now

141
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:44,480
is funded by me walking in with guitars being the the exotic American with 16 digits pretending that

142
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
this is all I don't know anything about money all I know is they said you can use this card

143
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,520
okay Mr. Berksman yes of course and I got cash by by saying you know I don't know if you guys

144
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,840
still do this oh well we don't really give cash against the room anymore it wasn't you know like

145
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a bit of a trouble here I'm not quite sure what to do and then the bank rates and the exchange

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
rates are just terrible I'm losing so much money on these exchange rates like oh yes they are quite

147
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
terrible we can give you a better rate actually here but it's actually a nominal commission

148
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,800
charge okay let me let me get 500 euros against the card like of course Mr. Berksman and so I would

149
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,000
do like every other day get 500 euros and that's how we'd amass enough cash to get through it this

150
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,920
the next adventure um okay so after spending $10,000 a month on each hotel and the DAS stew is

151
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,520

192
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,440
yeah the first one yeah probably remember how I kept saying the girl the dragon tattoo ending

193
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,040
is what I had planned I don't remember the end it's where she hacks the the bad guy the bad

194
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,200
businessman steals all his money puts it all offshore and and it goes to different banks

195
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,320
as a as a character she created that doesn't exist only on paper kind of like the straw

196
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,400
shank redemption ending as well and that's what I had planned with my mom was to take all that

197
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,280
for myself and do that and just live in some somewhere where that couldn't be extradited for

198
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,480
stealing back the you know and putting my mom into a rehab making her living in a sober living

199
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,160
environment that was my plan that's how angry I was very very angry but that's the the girl

200
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,880
with the dragon tattoo ending I've been saying that to you for fucking years um David I'm going

201
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,160
for the girl with the dragon tattoo ending I know and I don't pay any attention to the girl with the

202
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,880
dragon tattoo I should I should I'm pretty sure I've seen it anyway so the widow's there you

203
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,080
she asked you what is it you want she's crying you say I'm looking for connections

204
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,240
you want to understand how did she talk to luka did you know me with her yeah okay although the

205
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:37,600
language barrier was really something so did his daughter's help no um okay he's got a lovely daughter

206
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:46,560
so you um are asking him and her you're trying to figure out is there something that kind of links

207
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:54,640
the deaths of your father and david rossi yeah and then also mckaylee fights a lot yeah um so you

208
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,120
talked for an hour so uh and but the language barrier is too much you offered to get a translator

209
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,360
he said I can't mind I'm staying at the hotel now directly across the yep I've got that yep um

210
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:16,160
it uh it's two level sweet and a duplex duplex with frescoed ceiling yeah it's beautiful um

211
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,160
I've stayed in a hotel near there actually it's uh with also a frescoed ceiling yeah yeah

212
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,680
which one I don't remember it's years ago um

213
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,040
okay so you offered a hired translator he says no the stuff we're talking about is too sensitive

214
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,360
to have a stranger he instead invites you for lunch the next day and his two daughters would

215
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,240
translate but did you put in keep in mind that this david rossi's story is like the oj simpson

216
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:56,480
story of sienna yes yes it's huge so that's why he was so paranoid um okay so you come next day

217
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,840
and he paints this kind of sordid picture of the corrupt relationship between doigcha and

218
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,760
monnie deposky talks about how faisola knew or should have known that these guys were up to no

219
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,000
good it talks about the monnie deposky's connections to the mob and corrupt local politicians and

220
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,560
that was complete open secret uh he told you the lawyer told you that rossi had been mixed up in

221
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:29,040
some bad stuff himself renting a car once a month and driving to switzerland to logano yeah to logano

222
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,960
to put cash and secret bank accounts for like local mobsters basically you know including uh one

223
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,360
cardinal scurrano and vatican if chief uh about a vatican financial officer yeah okay it was the

224
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,680
chief one but and so you're taking notes and like really intrigued by in fact he showed me these

225
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,560
notes yeah i still got them in the suitcase do you want me to pull them on no that's okay um

226
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:03,200
and it 13 pages of notes no you've showed them we we went over this last time i was here um

227
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:13,680
so um the way you explained this to me the last one i talked about this is which was a year ago

228
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,560
was that this was like really intriguing but you were also like a little bit jealous about it in

229
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,360
some ways like it was so simple it was obviously very complicated but like it seemed like rossi

230
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,320
had been murdered yeah right he like felt the window backwards those two guys approach yeah going back

231
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,480
to David Gray showing me this right yeah exactly and that is like much easier to understand in a

232
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,480
way even though it's complicated than what your dad did absolutely yeah um which is why i like this

233
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,280
theory but of course you like the theory that your dad was murdered you're extorted they're

234
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:56,880
forced to kill himself right this is my leading theory at the time okay okay so he gives you a

235
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:05,280
bunch of documents uh luca garachi and you leave tuscany yeah with tuscany and sienna well sienna's

236
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,040
in tuscany sorry okay tuscany's like the region yeah well more specifically it leaves yeah but

237
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,520
fine i can eat tuscany because it's tuscany it sounds a little broad in general it's like

238
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,920
it's about now with the tuscany because if you go to tuscany you go to tuscany well sienna is a tuscan

239
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,720
hilltown okay fine i don't have to figure about it but i it's now you don't want to figure about it

240
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,160
i mean it's it's it's it's it's move it's move you want to figure um i i'm going to tuscany like

241
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:42,480

242
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:52,400
tuscany no um but florida's tuscany oh i don't think so i think florida's south it's really

243
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,200
further south i'm pretty sure i'm not plugging the internet here but if you really care it's easy

244
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:05,680
enough to look up uh find the bicker yeah okay so so okay you and i might need a little help with

245
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,880
the chronology here so you leave sienna yeah you go to germany i go to berlin you go to you go to

money to posky documents yeah you're sharing them with a bunch of journalists yeah there's like a

279
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,120
small flurry of stories and other media about yeah this stuff that you've been planted um

280
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:39,680
um this is when i've got the view switch to oxy um i actually did that in amsterdam uh so when i

281
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:48,000
first before the car was uh uh someone had stolen the computer from the car i had seen a doctor and

282
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,960
started on about 20 milligrams he gave me like 30 20 milligram pills of oxy because i was still

283
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,280
kind of detoxing from france as decoding was you know harder to get in amsterdam and hamsters

284
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,480
hamster and get anything else why am i dealing with over the counter code code even i'm fucking

285
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,240
in amsterdam so i go i find a doctor who describes whatever you want because me oxy i run out of that

286
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,920
while i'm at uh league and bows and i switched to opium poppies so there's you can buy just dried

287
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,280
opium poppies you crush them up pour hot water on it let it sit for a couple minutes and you drink

288
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,440
opium tea and it's fucking glorious it's glorious and that got me through a lot of misery when i had

289
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,640
no money but you can always get the opium poppies for like a euro you know you can borrow a fucking

290
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,880
european somebody get 20 of them it's dirt cheap and it just was great um and then when i finally got

291
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,800
cash again that i went to the doctor it was in nuremberg it was a great doctor to prescribe me

292
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,840
80 milligrams like 200 tablets for two weeks okay so what i've got is that by the time you're in

293
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,480
prog you're it got me through it got me through it's you're doing about 10

294
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,120
80 milligram pills a day no not in prog that was in france when it got to france i was up to 10

295
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,480
so how many what were you doing in prog um i'd say uh about half that five maybe six a day okay

296
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,480
five yeah um

297
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,640
i've never done that or is that like an addiction at that point or is it what is an addiction is

298
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,720
a habit it's not like a habit you know i mean but what happens if you stop taking it i don't know

299
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
there's many different people who give you well what's your experience a theory between

300
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,400
addiction and habit but yeah i mean i could stop if i didn't want to you know and i was forced to

301
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,560
a few times so i mean went off and on them um but it was just easier than buying off the streets

302
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,920
the doctors would give it to you you know you're getting you know it's reliable makes you happy

303
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,560
get through the day i'm not miserable i've got this described here as an addiction is that do you

304
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:06,640
think that's unfair no it's not unfair um i would say more you know uh tool but um okay i mean it's

305
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,640
the opiate addiction right i mean all i know that is what i read and it's like obviously extremely

306
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,440
addictive well i mean i think about just think about alcohol in terms of alcohol yeah but it's

307
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,080
a lot more addictive than alcohol isn't it it depends on the person then okay fair enough so

308
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,960
hate oxycodone some people love alcohol they hate all other drugs but yeah okay you know some people

309
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,240
hate and i'm the other the flip side of that yeah um okay so september 2016 you go to a

310
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,440
vote-of-fun store to get a new sim card and guess what happens in prog yes okay so your turn i got

311
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,160
pulled over by the interval people remember i tell me tell me the license plate number i went to sleep

312
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:55,680
in uh somewhere between nuremberg and prog and i had already been pulled over for a speeding

313
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:02,080
through a checkpoint when i was going to lugano and they took my passport i told them that i was a

314
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,800
journalist and i was doing a story on montia pasca and i showed them all the documents i had

315
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,520
etc etc and they they bought my story and they said okay well just don't go through fast these

316
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,760
checkpoints and how long you've been in this country by the way let's go back and forth it's

317
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,560
like well you need proper visa to be to be staying here longer than three weeks so it's okay i'll

318
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,560
coming back through again i said well you can't come back through again it's the thing you have to

319
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,880
actually you know i didn't pay attention to them i just kept going back through the they're all

320
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,200
shagging countries you're supposed to be allowed to do this i don't understand the issue um but and

321
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,200
then i at this last point that we're talking about now i'm going to prog i pull over at like a rest stop

322
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,800
during the day to just sleep in the car and snore a couple more of the oxys and just because i was

323
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,560
fucking exhausted um and i wake up and there's they're knocking that well actually i wake up i

324
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,560
saw them pull in i was already up i was listening to some podcast Neil deGrasse Tyson this fucking

325
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,440
podcast was getting through all this shit it was it's a good podcast um and the car pulls in

326
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,280
in front of me and it's another bmw and that just it's like an undercover copper i don't know how

327
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:15,600
they do it in germany or in interpol um and this sort of short-stop guy comes out and this sort of

328
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:23,200
tallish elderly or older blonde woman uh the woman can speak english the other guy cannot and he's

329
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,560
carrying a gun and they've got official documents saying that they're uh with interpol and but in

330
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,800
conjunction with uh a german something that bnd here i don't know whatever german state

331
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,280
running agencies and they're one of what i'm doing here why i keep going over the

332
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,640
the border so many times can't there's so many times can they search my car

333
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,240
i'm like dude i'm just a guy you know i'm a journalist i'm trying to figure out the story

334
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,440
because i don't want to talk about my dad so i just it's just easier to say i'm a journalist at

335
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,720
this point it's my cover it's like you know i'm just i can show you all what i'm working on here's

336
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,200
here's search me on the internet so i i am who i am here's my passport

337
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,400
do nothing wrong um they say well you've been going over the border waits many times you

338
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,720
cannot come back to germany unless you get a proper visa and they say can we search your car

339
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,440
and i'm like well you can but take a look and i do the old the shirt from the electric

340
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,320
electric gulet acid test if you remember tom wolf and when neil castley gets pulled over by a uh

341
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,960
uh a cop anywhere in america he keeps the back of his car does a filthy fucking mess and he says

342
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,000
my license is somewhere in the back of his car officer please uh let me just find it for you

343
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,720
might take some time and he just keeps pretending to look for the license until they give up so i

344
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,120
say well yes of course you know i have all my travel documents and visa stuff and everything's

345
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,800
available right here somewhere in my luggage and they see the luggage piled up as you've seen piled

346
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,320
up beyond the convertible roof and then i pretend to start opening up from the trunk and i start

347
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,760
looking for oh no i've got everything right here you know i've got the press uh pass i think it's

348
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,880
just lied my ass up and they just sort of sat there and watched the the older guy was just new

349
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,200
ass full of shit but you couldn't really do anything and the woman they got some call about

350
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,240
something else and he heard them talking german and they said okay look just get a fucking visa

351
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,000
next time you're through here and they just wanted to verify and they didn't ask me if i

352
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,160
drugs in the car and i said i did and i have prescription for them and i showed them prescription

353
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:32,880
i got from the doctor in urnberg and that was enough for them at that point okay and then i cross

354
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,560
over and there's no there's no passport check to get into prod at that point right so you are

355
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,280
supposed to have a visa to be in the EU you don't you're a european citizens don't need visas to

356
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,600
travel between countries but americans after three months and i'd been there well over three months

357
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:55,920
at this point yeah okay so shakin or tushkin what's the word it's i can't even maybe it's shakin

358
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,760
it's the it's the treaty that allows open borders between european countries so okay anyway you're

359
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,440
in prog so yeah 2016 yeah you go to the vote upon story you get a sim card come back to your the

360
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,320
bmw convertible life cigarette prepare to drive away and all of a sudden out of nowhere comes this

361
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,960
hulking dude and asks what you do yeah and i remember feeling that there was something wrong

362
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,800
with that day as soon as i got into that that fucking that mall is like a check a mall in check

363
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,720
and then prod it's very strange just looking for a vodafone and i felt like i was being followed

364
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,960
and i remember larry saying be careful and like god damn it i don't see you know i can't my skills

365
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,360
aren't that good to pick up on being followed and i don't want to live in this fucking paranoid world

366
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,520
that larry wants me to live in so like i'm not being followed not being followed but just the fact

367
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,840
that thought popped into my head at that specific time this means my instincts were up

368
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,760
and the alarms were going off and i probably should have listened to them but i just pretended

369
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,480
that it was my own paranoia and i don't really know what you could have done about it it's like

370
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,280
there's like that guy was like following the guy i mean i don't know he for some reason he waited

371
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,840
till i got into the car um right there so okay and you know where his car was it was parked right

372
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:15,840
across from mine you know so okay so as this guy's attacking you and obviously i've seen the video so

373
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,160
there's uh the thing that keeps flashing through your mind is that this is deutcha that sent someone

374
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,160
to finally kill you no not deutcha the the mafia because of the everything i learned from luca

375
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,920
about montian poskey and the calibria mafia calibria mafia i thought this is a mafia fucker

376
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,200
because he was italian and it just came from fucking i've been spending all my time translating

377
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,960
by hand pdf documents that were scanned from montian poskey david rossi's emails and just the

378
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,520
antevented to deal everything that he gave me you've seen it thousands and thousands of fucking pages

379
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,760
so i've got italian mafia in my head i just have been to legano to try and get the search

380
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,760
of your money looking at the at the banks that have david rossi was dropping these his bags of

381
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,200
cash off so i'm thinking mafia mafia mafia here's an italian doesn't speak a word pulling me out of

382
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,880
my fucking car i thought i was gonna die i really thought i was gonna die it's terrible and i'm so

383
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,240
stupid because i had bought for uh just for the show a uh in urmberg you can buy like a pellet gun

384
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,960
it looks exactly like a proper gun and i had that in the glove compartment and had i brought it out

385
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,080
maybe the guy would have run away i don't know yeah or maybe he would have shot you or maybe

386
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,480
he would have shot me but all i could think of was use the phone so it's the best weapon i have is

387
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:38,080
this phone um okay so please come in the video recording of the phone right of course the um

388
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,120
and it remained a miracle to me that you both videoed it and we're smoking a cigarette and

389
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:54,640
we're fighting this guy it's impressive thank you very well coordinated um okay so it turns out

390
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:02,080
obviously after uh dealing with the cops this guy's not an assassin yeah he is a repo man repo

391
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:08,240
man and he gets your car he gets the car and you did at that point in fact owe abis a lot of money

392
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,640
no they still owe me 15 grand they had not given me anything right but they but so put that aside

393
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,640
they you owed them for this bmw like you hadn't been paying you'd had this now for a few months

394
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,160
yes and because they had told me they this was free this car was now free because of all this

395
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,600
shit that because i did not charge it i i was well but i was looking for lawyers to the best i could

396
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,440
but no one would represent me for free against avis so their thing was you can have this car for

397
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,840
free but you have to return it to france you know and they say you can have it for a month

398
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,360
i'm like okay great but i kept it longer than a month because i was like fuck you avis and keep

399
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,760
as long as i fucking want after what you did to me and that was how that worked out for you it did

400
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,000
well and you know how it worked out for me but that was the thing and then it wasn't i didn't

401
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,800
owe them any money they still owed me money right since i went back to berlin that they gave me half

402
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:06,240
of that back half of it okay so seven thousand okay so now you owe me fucking five grand okay so

403
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,880
now you were without a car yeah uh and six weeks later it's the election you stay up all night

404
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,160
uh watching the results well just for the chronological order i went like when i first

405
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,160
got to prog or checked into the holiday because it was the easiest thing at three in the morning

406
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,720
and they accepted late check-ins and that's where i had the car and that's the hotel staying out

407
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,400
in the car was repossessed and i did the whole thing and the woman from central cast do you

408
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,320

409
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,560

410
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,440
oh right yeah yeah yeah i'm just a story yeah but i don't need the whole story i mean there's

411
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,600
ultimately and the police drove me back to the holiday right okay i stayed in there

412
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,480
just highs how this might i was defeated it was feeling terrible i'm just watching netflix

413
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,560
trying to write my story because the whole purpose of going to prog was to write my story

414
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,000
you know everything that's happened up to this point couldn't outright shit and started hacking

415
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,800
more into my mom's uh my mom's files to see if i can find more credit cards at this point

416

420
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,680

425
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,600
money that i had masked uh by taking cash out against the rooms which is i had a bunch of cash but

426
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:17,120
i think it was about 3,500 euros i owed and plus i had julie's account that i had money coming into

427
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:24,560
from america from vju which is about 25 to 2,800 a month and from that i took out what i put in

428
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,160
exactly what i put in julie unbeknownst to me had already been taking money out of that account

429
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,560
that i had put in so i was like fucking julie is like well you know what i owe her she's letting me use

430
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,800
her her bank accounts she had to do is a joint account it had my name on it i had a card with

431
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,120
my name on it as well and julie had her own so i was pissed off that she was taking money out of

432
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,120
this account but i had enough to cover the 3,500 i owe this place but i didn't know what to do about

433
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,840
going to a new place so that's why i went to an airbnb and started using airbnb i've never used

434
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,760
airbnb in my life and i should have been doing it the whole time because you can get

435
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,720
fucking great value especially in prog and that's why i started going to airbnb and using

436
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,000
the money i had left i transferred to a new account i did a new td bank account online

437
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,920
from prog and put money instead of going to julie's account cancelled that and put it back into my

438
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,280
account in my name from td bank okay that's how i started so i lived on 2,500 a month at that point

439
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,320
in airbnb okay we're gonna pause okay just break this up yeah
