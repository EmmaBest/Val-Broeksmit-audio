start	end	text
0	8040	it's recording now sorry okay can you just okay yeah I was looking through the
8040	11480	text just to find out I know but we've got to figure out a good way to record
11480	15480	oh no I never started it was a problem see that now it's he's got the
15480	18960	recording line okay cool so now we know it's cool alright so just to reiterate
18960	28320	we're looking through the DBTC MCO breach report in relation to Don Ska Bank and
28320	32760	we're trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at yeah and my
32760	39280	understanding from the source that I talked to isn't it this is all this is
39280	44520	showing that on a given date which is in this case October 18th 2013 this is the
44520	52120	exposure that Deutsche Bank's USC and a DBTC has DBTC yeah it's a DBTC is the
52120	57960	parent company of DBTC there's like this place is organized like it's like
58320	61680	thousands of legal entities stacked on top of each other so your dad's still
61680	67120	New York base this is still DBTC is also DBTC in base in New York shoot I just
67120	73040	press but yes and and this is what your dad was on the board of both of them
73040	79960	which is why he was getting emails like this with this huge I thought DBTC a was
79960	86520	just specifically DBTC I okay I know you're saying there is a narrow right
86560	94840	DBTC your dad was on the board of both okay and look as I said the thing that
94840	100640	my guy said it was really interesting about this is not really particular
100640	106800	transactions but it's that there are if you go back to the main page of that
106800	111280	spreadsheet you'll see there no the one with the the one we're just looking
111280	114280	at the trades
114840	123080	it's pivot maybe okay yeah if you go it's gonna be really hard to do this on a
123080	127000	tablet but if you were to go do a search for the word Russia for instance or
127000	131360	Moscow you'll see that they're doing business with and I'll show you I've got
131360	135400	this on my computer as well let's just pull it up on your computer well no I
135400	139240	don't know this spreadsheet I just have I'm sure honestly I have you know it's
139240	144200	branching just search MCO breach report as the title of the sheet
146760	156480	this is I don't have it downloaded the but what I do have is I have in the text
156480	168080	of the book I've written down the names of some of the like weird institutions
168600	178320	that show up in the spreadsheet and weird institutions searching for Moscow and
178320	189880	if you tell me with John Moscow my guy is a trip I really think so so here are
189880	193720	some of the entities like there's first of all VTV which is the big and that's a
193720	199840	state-owned bank right that yeah and it's run by one of Putin's closest pals
199840	203800	I know and it's very close size of Deutsche Bank so there's tens of
203800	209960	millions of dollars it shows in outstanding transactions with VTV on
209960	214760	this particular given day there's also but there's all these other obscure
214760	217960	Russian banks that I personally never heard so there's Russian International
217960	222040	Bank okay I know what that is there's Russian joint-stop commercial roads bank
223000	228880	there's Russian mortgage bank okay there's Russian commercial bank Cyprus
228880	232440	limited that makes sense I mean well they're just they're doing business with
232440	236560	a ton of Russian banks and it's really cool all the season people created I don't
236560	241760	think for them between their their may be in the transaction maybe not
241760	247560	necessarily that a lot of them so look if you look in this they're also doing a
247560	251680	ton of business with that you said Don's good banks are doing business with like
251720	256320	Conoco Phillips is in here there's so it's a rain some of these are very
256320	261760	mainstream Arab petrol yeah they're doing a ton of business on this particular
261760	267520	day with a ton of different companies right okay so I don't think this is
267520	271600	gonna answer the fundamental question about clearly they're doing business the
271600	273840	Don's command but this is Deutsche Bank it's one of the biggest banks in the
273840	279920	world is doing business on any given day with like thank you David I know but
279920	283680	look Don's good bank if there's a breach report so we're talking about breaches
283680	289520	in the breaches between Don's good bank and Deutsche Bank so it's not anything
289520	295400	that has to do with see I don't think it reaches I think the breach is that they
295400	300680	have Deutsche has limits that it's normally supposed to be staying with
300680	306080	him so right a breach is when they go over below yeah those thresholds and
306240	312240	breaches I understand but I'm saying this if we can see how much money Don's
312240	315240	good banks owed to Deutsche or Deutsche's owed to Don's good bank and we can
315240	320280	sort of cross-reference with 150 billion that's being reported today you
320280	325160	might have a timeline that we can create from that yeah I understand what you're
325160	329920	saying I don't have the capacity to do that I've spent so many hours looking at
329920	339480	this yeah and it okay well show it to your expert friend with I will yeah I
339480	341760	will do that I mean maybe that's something to say it could be just shot in
341760	346720	the dark it might be worthless but it's worth just you know having once a look
346720	353240	over a quick look over I mean am I right or am I wrong I don't know yeah there
353240	357040	could be something there I mean I've had a I've spent a lot of time with this guy
357520	362360	there's and I think his view is that this is interesting because it shows the
362360	368360	variety of places that Deutsche was doing a ton of business with and it was
368360	372920	more than he thought especially as it related to Russia but was he at all
372920	377640	looking at it through the lens of Don's good bank and what was what's been
377640	381520	happening recently is this before all this is before dawn so now we have
381520	385280	something that might be helpful for that and again David I would like to say for
385320	388920	a year I've been telling you about this Don's good bank stuff here and you've
388920	392160	been saying it's it's silly it's silly but every time there's a new article
392160	397440	about it and now there's we have some a spreadsheet that shows that I was not so
397440	403800	silly you're not there's nothing silly about no I mean about my my referencing
403800	407400	this the spreadsheet in relation to Don's good banks relationship to Deutsche
407400	412760	bank I think there's something here I hear you okay and the guys that Glenn
412800	418480	hired said that this is interesting from a top completely different reason you're
418480	422080	telling me that I'm asking you that is that what he said no and we're gonna
422080	427200	shut that because we can't get into that that's we don't say the names or even
427200	440880	reference okay so yeah okay should we should we start doing a little yeah
440880	445840	let's just get to yeah how do you want to do this let's start the beginning and
445840	450720	just go through the whole thing I just read it to you yes I'll read it to you
450720	455960	yes and you can restore chocolate in a pillow yeah exactly if you have a roaring
455960	464840	fire yes it'd be lovely um that train that yeah raise that train raise that
464840	478160	here yeah I think it's a champion way over you know I've an idea let me I'm
478160	493240	just gonna pause you guys don't have 80% for me
508720	512320	except we'll eat up
525440	528260	you
528260	537780	All right, well, maybe we can just delete all that and just start again.
537780	538780	No, no, no.
538780	539780	It was like a test.
539780	540780	It's fine.
540780	541780	No, there's...
541780	544260	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to bring up that guy.
544260	548140	Yeah, just don't bring up any specifics about sources, because not because it's like...
548140	549140	But did you see what I was doing?
549140	552180	I was like making it look like that was a separate entity from the one that you could
552180	553180	join.
553180	554180	It's fine.
554180	555180	It's...
555180	556980	I was muddying the water, specifically, because I knew that's the guy you're referring
556980	557980	to.
557980	558980	So I made it look like this is a separate person.
558980	559980	Got it.
559980	560980	Okay.
560980	561980	Back up.
561980	562980	Yes.
562980	563980	It's obfuscating.
563980	564980	This source.
564980	565980	Let's not obfuscate anything.
565980	566980	Yes, it is.
566980	567980	That's obfuscating.
567980	568980	No, no, I'm not saying you're not obfuscating.
568980	569980	I'm saying let's not obfuscate.
569980	570980	Oh, okay.
570980	571980	Okay, so...
571980	572980	Okay.
572980	573980	So there are a couple of ways we can do this.
573980	574980	Yes.
574980	575980	One is...
575980	585980	In the way I've got this organized right now on my computer is...
586980	592980	Just a bunch of things in kind of roughly chronological order.
592980	593980	And I've actually kept out.
593980	595980	I've made kind of a document here for myself.
595980	596980	Can I see that?
596980	598980	Can you send me an outline to go through?
598980	599980	No.
599980	600980	Oh, come on.
600980	601980	No, we're not going to do that.
601980	602980	Because it's just like clips from them.
602980	606980	It's like paragraphs that I've cut and pasted into a separate document for the book.
606980	607980	Yeah, that's fine.
607980	608980	I can get that.
608980	609980	Yeah, not sure you'd love that.
609980	611980	But we're not going to do that right now.
612980	613980	Okay.
613980	620980	So basically the way I've got this organized is in chronological order of like your dad's
620980	621980	life onward.
621980	625980	So like your dad is born on November 5th, 1955.
625980	626980	Okay.
626980	627980	And we...
627980	629980	By the way, do we know if he was...
629980	630980	He was...
630980	632980	There are six kids, right?
632980	636980	And was he number three or number four?
636980	642980	So there was Laura and then Peter.
642980	645980	Or sorry, Laura, John, Peter, my dad.
645980	646980	Okay, so he was fourth.
646980	647980	Yeah.
647980	648980	Okay.
648980	649980	And then Sam and then Bob.
649980	651980	And then Sam and Bob.
651980	652980	Okay.
655980	660980	So what I'm not going to do unless you really want to is go through like absolutely everything
660980	661980	because there's a lot...
661980	663980	I would like to go through absolutely everything, yes.
663980	664980	You really want...
664980	665980	Yes.
665980	667980	The reason I say no is because a lot of this is stuff you've told me.
667980	668980	So it's like...
668980	669980	Yeah.
669980	670980	I would like to see how you have...
670980	672980	You're not going to really see how...
672980	673980	Reinterpreted what I told you.
673980	674980	It's not really...
674980	675980	Or reductively...
675980	676980	Okay.
676980	677980	Well, that's fine.
677980	678980	We can go through this in some detail.
678980	679980	So...
679980	680980	Okay.
680980	681980	Okay.
681980	689980	Well, actually, first of all, let's go through the moment, the day on January 26th, 2014,
689980	690980	which...
690980	691980	Is that today?
691980	692980	No.
692980	694980	That's almost exactly five years ago.
694980	697980	Today is January 25th.
697980	698980	Okay.
698980	709980	So you get out of the tube station, drizzling, you're in Sloan Square.
709980	714980	You had the previous night been jamming with your band.
714980	719980	And you have told me in the past that you just woke up that morning not feeling probably
719980	720980	the greatest.
720980	722980	It was more than jamming.
722980	723980	Yeah.
723980	725980	It was a show, I think, and then there was a party.
725980	728980	And I didn't fall asleep until maybe five or six a.m.
728980	729980	I remember.
729980	731980	I was with Beth.
731980	732980	Yeah.
732980	733980	Okay.
733980	734980	Let me grab some water.
734980	735980	Yeah.
735980	736980	Go on.
736980	737980	Sorry.
737980	738980	I'm listening.
738980	739980	Well, I just want to...
739980	740980	That's fine.
740980	743980	So you...
743980	747980	You felt like some sort of negative energy when you were on the tube.
747980	748980	Yeah.
748980	749980	It was very...
749980	751980	Can you just come back here?
751980	752980	Yeah.
752980	753980	Sorry.
753980	754980	I just...
754980	755980	No, I know.
755980	756980	That's...
756980	757980	Well, no.
757980	758980	I don't even need you to.
758980	759980	This is kind of what I'm saying.
759980	760980	Like, there's...
760980	773980	I don't really feel a need to fact check this kind of stuff with you right now because
773980	774980	it's...
774980	778980	This is coming straight from your mouth on 15 different occasions.
778980	779980	So...
780980	781980	Okay.
782980	783980	Okay.
783980	784980	So maybe we should...
784980	786980	You're wearing a hat, no.
786980	787980	Okay.
789980	791980	You don't like the idea of tube bald, man?
791980	792980	No, okay.
792980	793980	Let's be tube bald, guys.
793980	794980	Okay.
794980	795980	All right.
795980	796980	So, yeah.
796980	804980	So I was on the tube and I remember feeling this like overwhelming dark, terrible, foreboding
804980	806980	thing.
806980	807980	It wasn't foreboding, actually.
807980	808980	It was more...
808980	811980	Because foreboding would be for the future, but this was like in the moment.
811980	819980	And I thought maybe it was just like an echo of my lack of sleep and misery waking up early
819980	821980	for me to get down there.
821980	827980	But no, it was like a really dark sort of terribleness.
827980	829980	It's very hard to describe.
829980	830980	And you think that...
830980	833980	It's like a visual sort of thing as well.
833980	834980	It's very strange.
834980	838980	And I thought I was picking up from someone on the tube, you know, because sometimes,
838980	843980	you know, you're on the tube and you pick up other people's like sort of pathology or
843980	844980	emotions or whatever.
844980	846980	And you're like, wait, that's not...
846980	847980	Why am I feeling so...
847980	849980	And then you see the guy next to you like, oh.
849980	850980	You know.
850980	852980	And I was like, was there somebody...
852980	856980	But there wasn't anybody around me that was giving off this sort of terrible...
856980	859980	In hindsight, you think that was the moment your dad died?
859980	860980	Yeah.
860980	861980	In hindsight, yeah.
861980	866980	I wrote it down in my notes and I keep meaning to find it, but I still haven't done that
866980	867980	because I don't really want to look at it.
867980	870980	But I will do that if you can remind me.
870980	871980	Okay.
871980	872980	So...
872980	876980	Because at the time, every time I would have an idea or something, because I was still
876980	878980	writing music at that time.
878980	883980	And I would write down thoughts or ideas I had and that one was overwhelmingly strong.
883980	888980	So I wrote it down, like everything about it.
888980	891980	I didn't think much about that until months later.
891980	892980	Yeah.
892980	893980	All right.
893980	894980	So you get out of the tube.
894980	895980	It's drizzly.
895980	896980	You are...
896980	899980	You walk over to the Satya Gallery.
899980	900980	It's one o'clock.
900980	901980	Parents aren't there.
901980	902980	You text them.
902980	906980	You text your mom and say, where are you?
906980	907980	Where are you guys?
907980	908980	No response.
908980	909980	Correct.
909980	912980	And you go then browse around the Tashin bookstore.
912980	913980	Yeah.
913980	914980	Look at that Beatles book.
914980	915980	That's right.
915980	917980	And then who...
917980	920980	And then your phone rings.
920980	923980	And then the phone rings.
923980	925980	Well, there was a few more texts.
925980	926980	Where are you?
926980	927980	What's going on?
927980	928980	I'm here.
928980	929980	And they're usually never late.
929980	930980	I'm always the one that's late.
930980	931980	So...
931980	933980	And I was early this time, which is unusual.
933980	934980	That is...
934980	936980	I can vouch from personal experience.
936980	937980	That's unusual.
937980	938980	Yeah.
938980	944980	And I was looking through the book and I was trying to figure out a way for them to talk
944980	948980	my dad or mom into buying me this for my birthday.
948980	950980	And yeah, send multiple texts.
950980	956980	And then the phone call came in and I believe it said unknown or no caller ID.
956980	957980	I'm not sure.
957980	962980	Which was also strange because if it was my mom or my dad, it would come up as mom or
962980	963980	dad.
963980	964980	And it was a voice.
964980	968980	It was very hard to recognize and a very strong Russian accent.
968980	973980	And I think it was the housekeeper or one of the housekeeper's friends or somebody.
974980	975980	I don't.
975980	976980	It was very fuzzy stuff.
976980	977980	What did the voice say?
977980	978980	Emergency, emergency.
978980	980980	Your father or your father.
981980	985980	Well, your story is aligning perfectly with what I've got written here.
985980	986980	So that's good.
988980	989980	Of course.
989980	990980	You go into...
990980	991980	You grab a...
991980	992980	You hail cab.
993980	994980	Yeah.
994980	995980	I get a black cab.
995980	998980	It was raining a bit, I remember.
999980	1005980	And you get to 21 Evelyn Gardens and hop out of the cab.
1005980	1007980	Was there an ambulance there?
1007980	1009980	There was, yeah.
1009980	1012980	And so then what do you do?
1013980	1018980	That's when I knew that it was, you know, somewhat for real that there was something going on.
1018980	1022980	Just a verifiable ambulance.
1022980	1027980	You don't see an ambulance combined with emergency, emergency, you know.
1027980	1029980	I just ran out of the cab.
1029980	1035980	I paid the guy, remember, and ran out of the cab, ran up the stairs.
1035980	1037980	And I already told you all this.
1037980	1039980	I know, but it's good to just like...
1039980	1041980	It's actually helpful for me.
1041980	1043980	Like, do you not want to?
1043980	1044980	We don't have to.
1044980	1045980	I mean, this is the same thing.
1045980	1050980	So, yeah, I get in there, I open the door, and my dad was dead and he's on the floor,
1050980	1052980	lying on his back in the hallway.
1052980	1057980	The EMTs were there, and they were finishing up.
1057980	1061980	They were wrapping up their instruments, and my mom was wailing.
1061980	1063980	The current crying tears.
1063980	1065980	Very terrible scene.
1065980	1066980	Terrible.
1066980	1068980	Did you know he was dead?
1068980	1075980	I kind of just instinctively knew, you know, I mean, just when you see the scenes.
1075980	1078980	Yeah, I can imagine.
1079980	1081980	Okay, let's move on.
1081980	1084980	I'm sorry to have to, like, start out with it.
1084980	1086980	Okay.
1086980	1088980	You're not sorry.
1088980	1090980	Well, dude, I can tell...
1090980	1092980	I know you well enough that I, like, know...
1092980	1095980	I mean, I've heard the story a million times, obviously, but it's...
1095980	1098980	I don't enjoy running through the camera.
1098980	1100980	I know you're kidding.
1100980	1102980	It honestly is.
1102980	1103980	Don't worry, I'm just...
1103980	1104980	I'm not worried.
1104980	1106980	...giving you shit.
1106980	1108980	Okay, so...
1108980	1110980	So what are the details? Do we need...
1110980	1112980	I don't think we need to go into any more details right there.
1112980	1114980	I then kind of fast-forward a little bit.
1114980	1117980	What were the police and the notes? I mean, you have all that, right?
1117980	1119980	Yeah, I've got that, but I'm not going to get into that.
1119980	1123980	Why don't you tell me what you have, and then I will tell you if something is correct or incorrect,
1123980	1128980	rather than me saying the same thing I've been telling you for four years?
1128980	1132980	Okay, because it's really the way you have processed the information that's important,
1132980	1134980	not the information I give you again.
1134980	1135980	Yep, fair enough.
1135980	1142980	Okay, so let's rewind 55 or 60 years.
1142980	1143980	Okay.
1143980	1147980	And so it...
1147980	1151980	Bill's grandfather, your great-grandfather,
1151980	1153980	there's a guy named John Shaw Brooksman.
1153980	1154980	Yeah.
1154980	1156980	And he started off being a sheep rancher.
1156980	1157980	Okay.
1157980	1158980	Do you know that?
1158980	1160980	No, Gar.
1160980	1161980	Gar?
1161980	1162980	I think they call him Gar.
1162980	1163980	I don't know.
1163980	1164980	I...
1164980	1166980	He gave sheep ranching a try.
1166980	1167980	Oh, wait, on whose side?
1167980	1168980	On my...
1168980	1170980	This is your dad's...
1170980	1171980	Mother's side?
1171980	1173980	Dad's...
1173980	1175980	grandfather.
1175980	1176980	So it's paternal.
1176980	1179980	So his father's father?
1179980	1181980	His father's father, yes.
1181980	1182980	Okay, Jack's father.
1182980	1184980	So this is not Reverend Jack.
1184980	1186980	This is Reverend Jack's dad.
1186980	1187980	Yeah, no, this isn't different.
1187980	1191980	Gar is Jack's wife's father.
1191980	1195980	So your great-grandfather, Reverend Jack's dad,
1195980	1196980	becomes...
1196980	1197980	There's some great...
1197980	1199980	Like he wrote about his experience,
1199980	1202980	because he, for something back in 1906,
1202980	1203980	which I tracked down,
1203980	1205980	and he, after becoming a sheep rancher,
1205980	1207980	decided to be a banker,
1207980	1209980	and worked at a bank in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
1209980	1211980	and he started at the very bottom.
1211980	1213980	He was washing windows and scrubbing floors.
1213980	1214980	For your...
1214980	1216980	This was...
1216980	1217980	He described this.
1217980	1221980	This is probably, I guess, the late 1800s,
1221980	1225980	because he wrote about this in 1906.
1225980	1226980	Massachusetts?
1226980	1227980	No, in Iowa.
1227980	1228980	In Iowa? Okay.
1228980	1229980	He said,
1229980	1230980	all the money that fell on the floor went to me,
1230980	1233980	and for a while, it was pretty poor picking.
1233980	1235980	But he spent his career there,
1235980	1237980	and they were in banking,
1237980	1238980	and eventually he ended up
1238980	1240980	at a big Chicago bank, Harris Trust.
1240980	1243980	And by the Great Depression,
1243980	1246980	he had enough kind of seniority
1246980	1249980	that he was summoned to testify in Washington
1249980	1251980	before the big Senate committee,
1251980	1252980	the PCORA Commission,
1252980	1255980	that was investigating.
1255980	1256980	It was like, basically,
1256980	1258980	the financial crisis inquiry commission
1258980	1260980	80 years earlier.
1260980	1262980	What was this crisis over?
1262980	1263980	The Great Depression.
1263980	1264980	Oh, the Great Depression.
1264980	1266980	Yeah, so it was like the 1929 stock market crash,
1266980	1268980	and then they ensue in the Depression.
1268980	1274980	So, John, the banker as a son,
1274980	1277980	Jack, John Jr.
1277980	1279980	And the daughter.
1279980	1280980	Yeah.
1280980	1285980	Well, but for this kind of branch of the family tree,
1285980	1287980	the son is relevant.
1287980	1289980	So this is Reverend Jack.
1289980	1290980	He's not Reverend Jack at first.
1290980	1293980	At first, he's a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II,
1293980	1295980	sinks a U-boat.
1295980	1298980	Jack, Marys Jane,
1298980	1301980	who's a librarian and an amateur artist,
1301980	1303980	they then have six children.
1303980	1306980	And in the middle, number four is your dad.
1306980	1308980	And Jane's background is interesting, too.
1308980	1310980	I know, it is interesting.
1310980	1312980	She's got, and she was Yale as well.
1312980	1313980	Vassar.
1313980	1314980	Or Vassar, yeah, Vassar.
1314980	1316980	She's an intellectual family.
1316980	1317980	Very, yeah.
1317980	1318980	Yep.
1318980	1319980	Yeah.
1319980	1320980	Gar was her father.
1320980	1322980	Okay.
1322980	1325980	He's one of the school of Prescott Bush.
1325980	1326980	Interesting.
1326980	1328980	Yeah.
1328980	1329980	At Yale.
1329980	1331980	So Jack goes into the ministry
1331980	1334980	with the United Church of Christ.
1334980	1336980	Initially, he's in Galva, Illinois.
1336980	1337980	Yeah, that's right.
1337980	1340980	And it was,
1340980	1343980	Jane gave art lectures there.
1343980	1346980	Laura, so Bill's older sister
1346980	1348980	did some music performances there.
1348980	1349980	And there were, you know,
1349980	1350980	old newspaper records of this.
1350980	1351980	Right.
1351980	1357980	And Reverend Jack was known in the community as,
1357980	1360980	just like, not only like a pillar of the community,
1360980	1362980	but also someone who would,
1362980	1364980	he taught about the importance of understanding things
1364980	1366980	from other people's perspectives.
1366980	1367980	Right.
1367980	1370980	And this is something that,
1370980	1373980	your dad would later tell people that it's,
1373980	1376980	this is kind of one of the guiding principles in his life
1376980	1378980	that he learned was from Reverend Jack.
1378980	1382980	And so they lived in Galva on this quiet,
1382980	1384980	tree-lined street,
1384980	1389980	old two-story house that had been built in the Great Depression.
1389980	1394980	Bob later would say that there was a certain amount
1394980	1397980	of education pedigree, but there wasn't any money.
1397980	1399980	And they would, you know,
1399980	1401980	cycle through all these different communities
1401980	1403980	and to different churches.
1403980	1404980	Bob told you this.
1404980	1406980	No.
1406980	1408980	I've heard this from a couple of other people, though.
1408980	1411980	And Jane would decorate the houses
1411980	1413980	with watercolors that she would paint.
1413980	1414980	Sure.
1414980	1416980	She's good.
1416980	1417980	She's good.
1417980	1422980	So, Bill starts to grow up
1422980	1424980	and he has a newspaper route.
1424980	1427980	Gets his two younger brothers to stuff the papers.
1427980	1429980	Right, the newspaper route.
1429980	1430980	That's right, I forgot about that.
1430980	1432980	With like little pamphlets and do,
1432980	1436980	deliver them and Bill takes the money and saves it
1436980	1438980	and uses the money to buy a TV
1438980	1441980	that Reverend Jack had been unwilling to buy.
1441980	1442980	He goes to League Forest,
1442980	1445980	which is a, you know, elite prep school in the Chicago area.
1446980	1449980	He goes to Clark Men's College,
1449980	1452980	which is where I, 25 years later, would go.
1452980	1453980	And my sister would go, too.
1453980	1455980	And your sister would go.
1457980	1460980	And this is where your dance life gets a little bit,
1460980	1462980	not what I'd expected.
1462980	1467980	So he is, he is a big party-er.
1467980	1468980	Really?
1468980	1469980	A very big party.
1469980	1470980	Is he?
1471980	1476980	He was known as a binge drinker, pot smoker.
1477980	1481980	He, his friends would tease him about his preference
1481980	1484980	for what at the time were exotic women.
1485980	1488980	And also his preference for like, you know,
1488980	1491980	what was, well, they called him Billy Disco
1491980	1493980	because he really was cool in the gang.
1494980	1496980	I didn't know that one.
1496980	1497980	Billy Disco?
1497980	1498980	That's funny.
1498980	1499980	One of the things I've done is
1499980	1502980	I talked to a bunch of his college, old college friends.
1503980	1504980	Billy Disco?
1504980	1505980	That's fucking funny.
1505980	1507980	So they would, you know,
1507980	1509980	and I get into a little bit about
1509980	1511980	kind of the extracurricular activities they had.
1511980	1514980	And, well, you know,
1514980	1516980	there's like a dingy San Diego strip club
1516980	1518980	that they would go to that bill would later describe.
1518980	1520980	I think this is in the emails that you've showed me.
1520980	1522980	How they would slip dollar bills
1522980	1524980	into the G strings of heroin addicts.
1524980	1530980	There is a Vegas was a popular destination
1530980	1532980	as it was in my time when I went to CMC as well.
1532980	1533980	Yeah.
1533980	1538980	And so despite all of his like, kind of wild side,
1538980	1539980	he was also a really good student.
1539980	1542980	He was really into finance, even at,
1542980	1543980	the two things he was really into at that time
1543980	1544980	were politics and finance.
1544980	1546980	And he understood finance in this kind of like,
1546980	1549980	oddly sophisticated way for someone who was, you know,
1549980	1550980	a 20-year-old.
1550980	1552980	Well, he wanted to be a sports writer as well.
1552980	1553980	Yeah.
1553980	1554980	He wanted to be a journalist.
1554980	1557980	And so, well, listen to this.
1557980	1560980	So he, he was kind of getting,
1560980	1562980	getting some of his buddies in college
1562980	1565980	interested in stock trading and even in like little,
1565980	1567980	like very simple types of derivatives,
1567980	1568980	even at that age.
1568980	1571980	And how would Bill, who grew up without any money
1571980	1573980	and was on scholarship at CMC,
1573980	1575980	how would he make his own bets?
1575980	1576980	How would he finance that?
1576980	1580980	Well, he developed a fairly lucrative career,
1581980	1584980	writing term papers, term papers for other students.
1584980	1586980	He never told me this.
1586980	1589980	The way his friend, one of his best friends at the time,
1589980	1591980	John Shink, who's a classmate of his,
1591980	1594980	describes it as, it was mostly for some of the more
1594980	1597980	privileged students there.
1597980	1599980	And he says, quote, there are a lot of people
1599980	1601980	who wouldn't have made it through Claremont
1601980	1602980	if it wasn't for Bill's help.
1602980	1603980	That's funny.
1603980	1608980	So, really into politics, after graduating,
1609980	1612980	he did some campaign work for local Republicans
1612980	1614980	running for Congress while he was there,
1614980	1615980	while he was in college.
1615980	1617980	And after graduating, he lived in Pasadena
1617980	1618980	with a group of his friends.
1618980	1622980	And he and John Shink set up a consulting firm.
1622980	1627980	They produced position papers for a bunch of candidates
1627980	1631980	and basically for a bunch of Republican candidates
1631980	1632980	all throughout California.
1632980	1637980	And, but again, his like, his demons came out at night.
1637980	1639980	So, why do you say demons?
1639980	1644980	Because he was into, there's a lot of heavy drinking.
1644980	1646980	There were prostitutes.
1646980	1648980	But why is this your drinking with demons?
1648980	1649980	Why is this demonic now?
1649980	1650980	Why is this a negative connotation?
1650980	1652980	I don't think it's, it's not demonic.
1652980	1654980	It's that, it's an expression.
1654980	1656980	Yeah, I know the expression, this is your negative expression
1656980	1658980	to say your demons come out at night
1658980	1660980	because you like to party, you like to drink.
1660980	1662980	Well, he was known as...
1662980	1663980	It's a bit unfair.
1663980	1665980	Okay.
1665980	1668980	He, he just didn't know how to turn it off.
1668980	1672980	John Shink says another one.
1672980	1674980	Tom Marks, who's another Claremont alum,
1674980	1676980	and this is a guy, they then moved to Chicago
1676980	1678980	and this was his roommate at the time.
1678980	1680980	Okay.
1680980	1682980	Bill was wonderfully brilliant but deeply troubled.
1682980	1685980	In clinical terms, he was incredibly fucked up.
1685980	1687980	He did things by day that were not,
1687980	1689980	that were in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior.
1689980	1690980	I'm sorry, he did things by night
1690980	1692980	that were in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior.
1692980	1694980	And it, uh...
1694980	1696980	He's a proper person.
1696980	1697980	Yeah, he is a proper person.
1697980	1698980	There's, there's...
1698980	1701980	And look, and listen, so he...
1701980	1703980	What's, why is that...
1703980	1704980	What's wrong with that?
1704980	1705980	And why was it clinically fucked up
1705980	1707980	because that is the opposite of clinical?
1707980	1710980	I think that's a turn of phrase by his friend.
1710980	1711980	Oh, it's a quote.
1711980	1713980	Again, that's not my words.
1713980	1715980	Those are, those are his roommate's words at the time.
1715980	1717980	Whoever this guy is is...
1717980	1718980	Okay.
1718980	1720980	No, this is, this is two or three different people, though,
1720980	1721980	now who are being quoted.
1721980	1724980	Whoever said clinically fucked up is...
1724980	1726980	He said in clinical terms, he was incredibly fucked up.
1726980	1727980	That's, it's a...
1727980	1728980	Like, obviously...
1728980	1729980	In clinical terms, he's really fucked up.
1729980	1730980	No, that's like a joke.
1730980	1731980	I know, it's a terrible joke.
1731980	1733980	It's, it's not funny.
1733980	1735980	The, but here, look, there's another side to this
1735980	1738980	because this guy's also, Bill stands out,
1738980	1741980	your father stands out as the mature one in the group.
1741980	1743980	And when he says it's in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior,
1743980	1745980	well his daytime behavior was, he was the responsible one.
1745980	1746980	Okay.
1746980	1750980	He, uh, he needed a car to get to work.
1750980	1752980	Until he just went out and bought a used Mustang.
1752980	1753980	Yeah.
1753980	1755980	And it was like, he actually functioned in the real world.
1755980	1757980	And I can say, I know you can say it's like,
1757980	1759980	when recent graduates of college,
1759980	1761980	that is like not normal behavior, right?
1761980	1763980	It's like a whole, you have to get your parents involved
1763980	1764980	and like figure shit out.
1764980	1766980	He was figuring stuff out on his own.
1766980	1769980	When a colleague's wife died, Bill sent a sympathy card,
1769980	1771980	which would never recurred to his,
1771980	1772980	the people he's living with.
1772980	1774980	And his girlfriend says, quote,
1774980	1776980	I asked him why, and he said,
1776980	1778980	because it's what's done, it's the right thing to do.
1778980	1779980	That's right.
1779980	1781980	And most of us, Bill was self-sufficient and responsible.
1781980	1783980	I would hear a lot of that for him.
1783980	1785980	Cause that's what you do.
1785980	1786980	Yeah.
1786980	1787980	Cause that's what you do though.
1787980	1788980	You would say that often.
1788980	1792980	Well, he had that going when he was 21 years old.
1792980	1793980	Yeah.
1793980	1794980	Um,
1794980	1795980	Wow.
1795980	1798980	I've got a delightful little anecdote here that,
1798980	1801980	you know, it doesn't prove anything one way or the other,
1801980	1802980	but just interesting.
1802980	1804980	So in early 1980s,
1804980	1808980	Bill flies from Chicago to Vegas to have a little reunion
1808980	1809980	with John Shink.
1809980	1811980	So one of his best friends in college.
1811980	1814980	And, you know, they're drinking and gambling and it's late at night
1814980	1818980	and they're walking back down the strip toward their hotel.
1818980	1821980	And, uh, two prostitutes come up to them.
1821980	1824980	And, you know, these are two drunk 22 year olds or whatever.
1824980	1828980	So they're, uh, prostitutes or maybe 24 year olds.
1828980	1831980	Uh, prostitutes, uh, walk up to them,
1831980	1833980	start fondling them a little bit.
1833980	1835980	Guys aren't putting up much of a fight.
1835980	1838980	And then the prostitutes walk away and Bill and,
1838980	1841980	uh, John are walking back toward their hotel room.
1841980	1842980	Right.
1842980	1845980	And your dad realizes this whole thing had been a ruse.
1845980	1849980	The one of the prostitutes had stolen hundreds of dollars out of his pocket
1849980	1851980	while feeling him up.
1851980	1855980	And so Bill yells and then starts chasing them.
1855980	1857980	And he tackles one of them.
1857980	1858980	He tackles her.
1858980	1861980	And they are rolling around on a dirty sidewalk.
1861980	1863980	Bill trying to get his money back.
1863980	1867980	The prostitute gets presumably screaming until the cops came and broke it up.
1867980	1868980	That's funny.
1868980	1869980	Yeah.
1869980	1870980	Oh, that's great.
1870980	1871980	Did he get the money back?
1871980	1872980	He got the money back.
1872980	1873980	The cops gave it back.
1873980	1874980	Gave him the money back.
1874980	1875980	Wow.
1875980	1876980	Um, okay.
1876980	1880980	So, and again, I'm just doing this based on the way I've got this structured
1880980	1881980	right now.
1881980	1883980	So we're taking a little break chronologically.
1883980	1884980	That's great.
1884980	1885980	I didn't know that.
1885980	1886980	That's funny.
1886980	1889980	And we rewind to January 1976.
1889980	1891980	Bill's never told that story.
1891980	1893980	Never heard that.
1893980	1895980	Um, so we go, you're born.
1895980	1896980	Okay.
1896980	1897980	In Kiev.
1897980	1900980	Uh, to Allah and Alexander.
1900980	1906980	Um, I described that wonderful black and white photo that you have of them at the party.
1906980	1909980	Um, are you going to include these photos?
1909980	1910980	I don't know.
1910980	1911980	I don't know.
1911980	1912980	I mean, you can, you can if you want.
1912980	1913980	Okay, cool.
1913980	1914980	That's good.
1914980	1915980	I don't really know how that works.
1915980	1918980	I think for these purposes, I think it would be good to be able to do that.
1918980	1927980	Um, so, uh, Allah was, uh, I don't know if you know how much you know about this history
1927980	1930980	of Russian Jews in the seventies and early eighties.
1930980	1931980	Yeah.
1931980	1936980	I mean, so they, she after get graduate from college follows like a felt a fairly well
1936980	1943980	worn path gets an Israeli exit visa, uh, goes to first Vienna and then Rome, which it's
1943980	1944980	weird.
1944980	1946980	Like I never realized this until I started looking into your story.
1946980	1950980	Like that's a million other people did the exact same thing.
1950980	1954980	Not just leaving Russia, but going to Vienna and then Rome and then getting waiting in
1954980	1957980	Rome for getting those exit visas or is not.
1957980	1958980	Yeah.
1958980	1959980	It wasn't, you know, it wasn't easy.
1959980	1964980	But I heard the stories of selling my grandfather's medals and World War II medals and bribing
1964980	1966980	everyone along the way.
1966980	1967980	Yep.
1967980	1972980	And just looking, going back to like old news stories at the time, you can see people
1972980	1978980	like in very similar situation situations to your family at the time, like fleeing for
1978980	1981980	the same reason and following the exact same geographical path.
1981980	1986980	And so, uh, and in fact, a lot of them ending up in Chicago as well, which is obviously.
1986980	1987980	That's strange.
1987980	1989980	Why Chicago of all places?
1989980	1999980	I think it's just the, I mean, there's a local newspaper in 1978 or 1979 actually, which
1999980	2005980	is the same year your family arrived there, uh, described it as this is a local community
2005980	2008980	leader or the head of the Jewish community centers in Chicago told the local newspaper
2008980	2010980	that it's a mass exodus.
2010980	2012980	They're all coming here.
2012980	2019980	Um, so this is where things get a little bit ugly as you know.
2019980	2025980	And, um, so your mom is working in the Stanley Corsac department store.
2025980	2026980	Your mom gets a job.
2026980	2027980	She has two jobs.
2027980	2032980	One is a cocktail waitress and the other is working in this luxury good store on the
2032980	2034980	magnificent mile in Chicago.
2034980	2036980	This is this store is called Stanley Corsac.
2036980	2037980	Right.
2037980	2038980	She was selling for coats.
2038980	2042980	And I think her job actually as far as I can tell was creating displays.
2042980	2044980	So she was, um, right?
2044980	2045980	Yeah.
2045980	2046980	She did the windows.
2046980	2047980	Yeah.
2047980	2048980	The window displays exactly.
2048980	2049980	Well, that's okay.
2049980	2052980	Uh, Marie, you know the jewels are?
2052980	2057980	I saw some over on some of those little pop mango pods over there where my phone plugged
2057980	2058980	in.
2058980	2059980	Yeah.
2059980	2060980	Yeah.
2060980	2061980	The actual.
2061980	2063980	And also we need to.
2063980	2065980	Here I'm just going to.
2065980	2066980	Right.
2066980	2067980	Okay.
2067980	2070980	You got to keep a secret.
2070980	2071980	Okay.
2071980	2072980	It's off.
2072980	2073980	Okay.
2073980	2075980	So we'll just be careful.
2075980	2076980	Wait.
2076980	2077980	Sorry.
2077980	2078980	Say that again.
2078980	2083980	I'm not mentioning Marie.
2083980	2084980	Yeah.
2084980	2085980	Yeah.
2085980	2086980	Totally.
2086980	2087980	I mean, that's not chronologically.
2087980	2090980	That's like the very end of the pace we're going.
2090980	2092980	We'll get there in about two weeks.
2092980	2093980	Oh, okay.
2093980	2095980	So we're very careful talking to the camera.
2095980	2097980	So we don't know who you are.
2097980	2098980	Oh, I see.
2098980	2099980	So you.
2099980	2100980	Oh, shit.
2100980	2102980	So I, that's actually a good point.
2102980	2104980	I walked in here and was like, hi, Marie.
2104980	2105980	Yeah.
2105980	2106980	It's fine.
2106980	2107980	I mean, there's no.
2107980	2108980	Yeah.
2108980	2109980	Because.
2109980	2110980	For now.
2110980	2111980	Well, she might.
2111980	2112980	I don't know.
2112980	2113980	It's fine.
2113980	2114980	Don't worry.
2114980	2115980	I totally know what you're saying.
2115980	2116980	And that's not.
2116980	2117980	Yeah.
2117980	2118980	We just want to protect her for now until.
2118980	2119980	We just let my mom.
2119980	2120980	Um.
2120980	2121980	All that is not good.
2121980	2122980	I'm just here.
2122980	2123980	This thing.
2123980	2124980	She's not going to see that.
2124980	2125980	I mean.
2125980	2127980	This is going to like be what?
2127980	2128980	Let's do it.
2128980	2129980	That's actually happened.
2129980	2130980	It's going to be watched by a lot of people.
2130980	2131980	But not.
2131980	2132980	It's going to be in conjunction with.
2132980	2133980	Yeah.
2133980	2135980	But it's not like imminent in both control.
2135980	2136980	Over.
2136980	2137980	Anyway, it doesn't matter.
2137980	2138980	We're.
2138980	2139980	I like the word.
2139980	2140980	It's not imminent.
2140980	2141980	Um.
2141980	2142980	But just be careful.
2142980	2143980	Would you want me to get.
2143980	2144980	I couldn't get to the cafe.
2144980	2145980	No.
2145980	2146980	No.
2146980	2147980	I just mean.
2147980	2148980	Like.
2148980	2149980	I mentioned.
2149980	2150980	No.
2150980	2151980	The other jewels.
2151980	2152980	And all of a sudden.
2152980	2153980	Like someone.
2153980	2154980	Honestly, they do.
2154980	2155980	I.
2155980	2156980	Marie.
2156980	2157980	Like.
2157980	2158980	But it fell.
2158980	2159980	By the time this airs.
2159980	2160980	Let's say.
2160980	2161980	Well, but.
2161980	2162980	But just to be clear.
2162980	2164980	In again, the camera's off right now.
2164980	2165980	So.
2165980	2167980	Although your phone might still be recorded.
2167980	2168980	It's still.
2168980	2169980	Just turn it off.
2169980	2170980	Okay.
2170980	2171980	Um.
