136640	154960	gone mad yes and you start soon after that calls from reporters you've been
155120	158980	with over the past couple years wondering what if anything you have on
158980	165320	Trump including yourself did I yeah maybe and your quick search turned up
165320	173120	nothing okay so I mean all I did was search Trump yeah I had no idea what
173120	180320	understood okay so your mom as you said has cancelled her credit cards and
180360	185600	you're running out of money you decide to migrate south yeah so you brief time

193160	199160	lining up like acquiring drugs yes terrible that country was it's terrible
199160	203440	for prescription drugs okay then you move on to Rome had to get out of there
203440	209160	fast yes you move on to Rome you're renting a room in San Giovanni yeah
209800	218800	okay and then someone we will describe as Samantha Sheldon she identifies
218800	223320	herself as a reporter with the FT yes and said she's heard about him heard
223320	228480	about you sorry from another journalist and was interested in writing about you
228480	236200	in your story and so she flies from London to Rome on New Year's Eve well
236200	242440	should we say London I mean that's where the FT is based what can we just say
242440	250440	flies from a different country flies from out of the region flies from across
250440	256680	some water a body of water to Rome that makes the effort to fly from a faraway
256720	260920	country because we're giving it to me clues we say London and now it's all
260920	266680	in camera so thanks David well I don't know what's the problem with she's
266680	270440	identified herself as an FT reporter the FT is in London okay but we don't have
270440	273920	to say because it's just you there's many different offices FT there's FT in
273920	279680	Berlin there's FT in Nuremberg I mean not Nuremberg but another German place
279680	283280	there's FT offices all over the fucking world we'll discuss it later because we
283440	289520	discuss this person's identity okay so she flies to Rome on New Year's Eve you
289520	294400	spend the night wandering the city and you tell your story for it sorry FT in
294400	302120	Frankfurt not in Nuremberg but yeah sorry it really doesn't matter no it
302120	307240	does not just okay she you're telling your story walking around the city she's
307240	311080	recording that on her phone and kind of interrupting from time to time to point
311120	314600	out like ruined or church is kind of giving you a little history tour you
314600	319800	occasionally excuse yourself to the bathroom for oxy you end up at the
319800	325760	Colosseum right for midnight fireworks beautiful and you didn't spend New Year's
325760	331160	Day roaming as well and finally you've kind of developed a bond with her and
331160	338040	offer her a look inside your father's files she leaves Rome lies back to
338040	343640	wherever and prostitutes back in touch right okay so a couple days later or
343640	349160	few days later you leave Rome and head to Lisbon because a lot less expensive
349160	354280	obviously no I was sort of parted out I mean Rome was fun Rome was a good time
354280	358160	and there's a couple of things we missed with my others another FT guy that got
358160	364680	ahold of me forgot his name I had pictures of him he came to Nuremberg to
364720	369120	meet me for to look over some files I had about Monty Poskey specifically James
369120	381160	Schauder I said to TTR so when she said she was from FT Samantha Sheldon I thought
381160	386040	oh maybe it was from James Schauder that she got the information but she never
386040	390400	heard of James Schauder apparently so that was no that sort of made me more
390400	393240	comfortable worth of the FT and I've heard James Schauder you've heard James
393560	398480	like regular byline in the FT really yeah the odds of Samantha Sheldon work
398480	403320	at the FT and had not did not know a person like that is I would say
403320	408400	impossible well and so she told me so but that's what I had thought originally
408400	412800	that she did that's where they got my information okay so you're partied out
412800	417760	you move to Lisbon right you go to Lisbon you get another Airbnb room no
417760	421200	but remember this is there's a good stories here because I actually spent
421240	426600	time playing music live at the place called San Belushi like name of John
426600	429880	Belushi is a Italians love John Belushi so the name is bar called San
429880	435080	Belushi and they invite me to play every fucking every night it was fun and I
435080	440040	played and I jammed with all these great Italian musicians and there's a
440040	445000	couple of famous Italian actors too and I got a bar fights and right broke out
445000	449400	I was playing piano for the riot just for fun it's really high and there's
449440	455240	beautiful girl I think I sang her info too and it was fun it was a lot of fun
455240	460320	and then Landon starts calling me around the same time and Landon wants to do
460320	467480	the story this is prior to Samantha Sheldon showing up and Landon and I are
467480	472480	working on the story for Deutsche Bank and when it gets published in the
472480	477000	year's day I'm a bit upset and the Samantha Sheldon is aware of the story
477000	480000	being published as well be careful be careful
480000	483920	listen here at times Landon Thomas seems like a big guy knows what he's doing
483920	487560	it's upset with the story because it was not very well written this wasn't
487560	491240	exactly what I expected it was really it just sort of me under didn't have any
491240	496800	purpose so I was a bit upset with him about it I let him know I sent you the
496800	502080	emails I sent him he lied and told me that he had permission from Anshu to
502080	505400	quote from the note I said I would only give you the note if you get Anshu's
505400	509680	permission you need to just why don't you just get it from Anshu he's gonna keep
509680	513160	your permission but if he does not want to share with you personally I need you
513160	516440	to call him and get permission because I'm not gonna do it for you and he said
516440	521360	yes I talked to Anshu and Anshu said can you use selections from the note that he
521360	526560	left your father I said okay then go for it and so I okayed it and then the
526560	531080	story ran and then I hear from Anshu's people so we never okayed this and then
531080	536560	sent you this email too I got from Anshu's lawyers I'm not sure I think I
536560	541800	sent it to Vile sent it again and they said we did not okay this with Landon and
541800	547040	yeah but just in etc. just to play devil's advocate it's not I mean I have no
547040	551840	idea what happened yeah it would not be the first time that someone in the
551840	555080	situation of Anshu's people would have lied I'm not saying that is what happened
555080	558480	I have no idea but it's no but Landon backtrack said I didn't hear from Anshu
558480	562640	directly I heard from his lawyers yeah but they made it seem like it was okay
562640	566920	Landon that's very different than saying Anshu said it was okay and it's very
566920	569880	upset about it I wrote a whole thing I want to give it to the fucking editors
569880	575760	New York Times but I didn't cuz I wanted to spare Landon it's like it's a poor
575760	580440	landing I didn't want to destroy his I didn't want to get him in trouble I just
580440	583040	wanted to let him know I was upset so I wrote the letter to the other and just
583040	586560	gave it to him and this is why I'm upset I'm not gonna send it to anyone else but
586560	594560	I want you to know this is piss me off for future things that you did okay so yes
594560	599600	you go to Lisbon go to Lisbon you're renting an Airbnb room yes okay money
599600	606880	and oxy nearly exhausted yes what are you gonna do you call Sheldon I'm in
606880	611800	trouble you say but keep in mind Sheldon I've been talking like a couple times a
611800	617160	week yep yeah constant texting well this is much later right this is like this
