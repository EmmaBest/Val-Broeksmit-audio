0	3000	Hi, Nick, can you hear me?
3000	6000	Yeah, hey, can you wait one second while I finish an email?
6000	9000	Yeah, yeah, of course, of course, yeah.
31000	35000	Okay, hi, Val, how are you?
35000	38000	Hey, Nick, I'm okay, how are you doing?
38000	43000	Fine, I'm closing my section, it's a little busy, but let's talk.
43000	48000	Okay, so I did what I told you I would do,
48000	52000	and good grief, I spent about four hours doing this,
52000	56000	and I was up very, very late, so I just bear with me for a moment
56000	58000	and we get all this stuff together.
58000	60000	You cut out, I lost you after four hours.
60000	64000	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah, sorry, yeah, it took me about four hours to do this,
64000	69000	and I went through the entire article, just sort of line for line,
69000	75000	and I made notes on the ones that I felt were either inaccurate mischaracterization
75000	83000	or just not true, or, and I don't know what,
83000	86000	and again, I don't want to come off like a guy that's complaining about,
86000	88000	oh, I'm like, you know, you guys treated me badly,
88000	90000	that's not what I'm doing here.
90000	93000	Or maybe, again, like, maybe it is a little bit, but not 100%.
93000	97000	This is an aggregate of issues here.
97000	102000	And I just wanted to bring up one thing that you said yesterday before I start,
102000	108000	is that you told me, you said,
108000	111000	when I asked you about the credit card fraud, and I said,
111000	115000	well, there's one, I'm not a credit card thief,
115000	118000	and then you said, but aren't you, though?
118000	121000	And then I thought about that, and he said, well, what do you mean?
121000	124000	He said, well, that's kind of the crux of your character here,
124000	128000	is there someone that is an unreliable narrator,
128000	131000	down on, sorry, what was the thing you said?
131000	133000	Unreliable narrator or unreliable character,
133000	136000	but it's something that represents who I am.
136000	141000	And I said, well, that's based on just because one credit card,
141000	146000	my mother's credit card is the only credit card I've ever used in my entire life.
146000	148000	And he said, yes, that does, that's accurate,
148000	151000	and that is the basis of your quote unquote character.
151000	154000	And I thought about that, and I'm like, Nick,
154000	156000	and he's already made up his mind about who I am,
156000	160000	and I thought, wow, that's what the rest of the world is doing,
160000	161000	exactly what you're doing.
161000	163000	So based on this article, someone that does-
163000	164000	I don't think I would agree with that,
164000	166000	that I've already made up my mind about who you are,
166000	169000	and I'm not sure that that's exactly what I said.
169000	172000	But the comment to say, but Val, isn't that-
172000	174000	but aren't you though, right?
174000	177000	The comment just because I was your instinct told you to say that.
177000	178000	We're saying that, yes.
178000	181000	Yeah, so your instinct, you had an impulse to say that.
181000	183000	You didn't think it through, you had an impulse and you said it first,
183000	186000	because that is what you believe of me,
186000	190000	because the way you've already assembled who I am as a person in your head
190000	193000	is pretty much this person that David has described,
193000	195000	and that is the problem I'm having.
195000	196000	The rest of the world is going to do the same thing,
196000	198000	and that's a huge issue for me.
198000	201000	Because you don't know me, and it's not me,
201000	202000	and I can tell you that over and over again,
202000	206000	but it's already too late, you've already decided in a sense.
206000	209000	But of course, with different variations, you can change your mind,
209000	212000	but you have a pretty core sense of who you think I am.
212000	216000	And this is a problem, and that's why I want to go over all this stuff with you.
216000	218000	Well, Val, with respect to that, I mean,
218000	220000	I have to have a sense of who you are,
220000	224000	but it's not because of one detail in a story.
224000	227000	It's because I've talked with David extensively about this,
227000	231000	and we've gone through many drafts, which discussed this story.
231000	235000	I've read up in other ways.
235000	241000	So, you know, we only spoke in this is the second time we've ever spoken.
241000	244000	So I know some things about you, some things I don't,
244000	249000	but I think you might be a little fixated on that one detail
249000	253000	and a pretty long piece that goes into some depth.
253000	256000	I don't think I would agree with you that it's...
256000	258000	But it's just an example.
258000	260000	It's just an example, Nick.
260000	264000	I'm just giving you one example of many,
264000	266000	and that was just one thing that sure showed me
266000	269000	how people make up their minds on people very quickly,
269000	272000	and this is the issue I'm having with the article.
272000	274000	That's it. I don't put it all on you saying,
274000	277000	this is what you believe. I'm not saying that.
277000	280000	But I do understand where you're coming from.
280000	282000	I wanted to tell you that it's neither right or wrong
282000	284000	just to keep an open mind.
284000	287000	Really, you know?
287000	288000	Okay, cool.
288000	292000	So let me start with David didn't fact check with me.
292000	295000	So I asked him, are we going to do a fact check
295000	299000	about I think this was Sunday or Friday, maybe Saturday,
299000	301000	sometime in the weekend before you publish?
301000	303000	And so we've already done the fact check.
303000	305000	I said, what are you talking about?
305000	307000	So we did the fact check when I was here in 2015,
307000	309000	sorry, in 2019, January.
309000	311000	I said, well, David, that doesn't count.
311000	314000	It's pretty much exactly the same as the story
314000	318000	we went over in January 2019.
318000	320000	So that's part of the problem.
320000	323000	Had we done a proper fact check,
323000	327000	I would have told him about that $1,000 versus $5,000 thing.
327000	329000	And many of these other issues.
329000	331000	I'm still waiting for you to point out the fact
331000	332000	that's wrong in the story.
332000	333000	I don't.
333000	334000	Okay.
334000	337000	As far as you're aware, yes.
337000	339000	So I'm going to change your awareness.
339000	340000	Ready?
340000	341000	Okay.
341000	343000	Number paragraph one, an unemployed rock musician
343000	347000	with the history of abuse and credit card theft.
347000	350000	Again, this is where we're going back over the same shit,
350000	351000	but this is the same thing.
351000	353000	Unemployed rock musician is inaccurate.
353000	355000	I am a musician.
355000	356000	I am employed.
356000	358000	I have a company called Bikini Robot Army Productions.
358000	359000	I am self-employed.
359000	362000	I make money from royalties monthly.
362000	364000	You know what a royalty is, I'm sure.
364000	367000	That's part a is inaccurate history of abuse.
367000	369000	Of course, that's I'm not contesting that.
369000	373000	But credit card theft, again, is misleading and mischaracterization.
373000	377000	And in my head, one credit card stolen from my mother is not,
377000	381000	does not equate to credit card history of credit card theft.
381000	385000	Technically, yeah, of course, it's just like saying, you know,
385000	387000	whatever, I can give you a bunch of ridiculous examples,
387000	389000	but you know what my point is.
389000	392000	And there's no point in going over the whole thing again.
392000	394000	But I just want to make that clear.
394000	395000	And is that okay?
395000	397000	You got, can you hear me?
398000	399000	I can hear you.
399000	400000	You just said a lot of things.
400000	403000	I'm actually not sure which particular thing you're asking me to respond to.
403000	404000	Oh, whatever.
404000	407000	Well, I guess the number one, I am employed.
407000	410000	I have my own company, Bikini Robot Army Productions,
410000	413000	and I am paid with royalties.
413000	417000	Royalty checks monthly from one to two different tune core.
417000	419000	And what's the other one?
419000	421000	I can't remember the name of the distributor,
421000	424000	but there's two different distributors that pay me.
424000	428000	So that is, I guess, technically not factual.
428000	432000	And again, I guess you want to start with that?
432000	434000	Sorry.
434000	435000	Sorry, I talk over.
435000	436000	I'm so sorry.
436000	438000	Just tell me to shut up if I start talking too much.
438000	441000	No, no, no, no, no, this is fine.
441000	444000	Well, let's try to be organized about this.
444000	447000	So that's, I mean, if you, if you're disputing whether you were,
447000	450000	yeah, the time of this meeting in a lead unemployed or not,
450000	453000	that is something factual that we can look at.
453000	458000	The best way to raise these factual points is an email to me.
458000	463000	I mean, the only thing is it's 508 on a Friday,
463000	465000	East Coast time right now.
465000	467000	So this piece has already been online for,
467000	468000	oh no.
468000	471000	This is the fourth day, and it's going to print press
471000	473000	very, very, very shortly.
473000	475000	I know that's why I want to talk to you so quickly.
475000	477000	That's why I'm, yeah.
477000	480000	I want to hear absolutely every,
480000	485000	every objection you're making in terms of the factual accuracy
485000	486000	of the piece.
486000	487000	Yeah.
487000	489000	That's, but do you see Nick?
489000	490000	What I'm saying about is whether it's,
490000	491000	Sorry.
491000	493000	Fortunately, the best way to do this is on email.
493000	495000	You know, you can be very, very clear,
495000	496000	but we're also running out of time.
496000	497000	I know that's a problem.
497000	498000	That's a problem.
498000	500000	But that's why if we can, if you sit down,
500000	501000	if you give me like 30 minutes,
501000	503000	I'll go through all of it and then I'll leave it to you.
503000	504000	And I won't argue with you.
504000	506000	I'll just say this is, I'll leave it in your hands.
506000	507000	You know?
507000	508000	Okay.
508000	510000	Right now you're saying you were unemployed.
510000	511000	You were self-employed.
511000	512000	You had a company.
512000	513000	Yeah.
513000	514000	And you were royalty checks.
514000	515000	Yeah.
515000	516000	Are you hearing that roughly, correctly?
516000	517000	That's exactly it.
517000	518000	Yes.
518000	521000	But it's not had a company, have a company, still do.
521000	525000	Well, we're talking about a line and a piece where this is action
525000	530000	taking place in what you're earlier, earlier this year.
530000	531000	Okay.
531000	532000	It's not that far away.
532000	533000	Yeah.
533000	534000	That's good.
534000	535000	Let me make a note of this.
535000	536000	Okay.
536000	538000	You know, anything you say, I'm going to check with David,
538000	539000	we're going to check independently.
539000	540000	Sure.
540000	541000	And make sure that our piece is totally accurate.
541000	542000	Of course.
542000	543000	Let's move on to the next one.
543000	544000	Okay.
544000	548000	Point number two was the credit card theft with a history of credit card theft.
548000	551000	A history of open abuse and failure.
551000	554000	Well, you have a history of credit card theft.
554000	557000	I don't, you're not going to get any satisfaction here.
557000	558000	Okay.
558000	559000	I'm just telling you that's the one thing.
559000	562000	You have a credit card and it's not, I know that's how you don't want to,
562000	564000	you don't want to look at it that way.
564000	565000	Yeah.
565000	566000	I got you.
566000	568000	I just want to make it known and make it clear.
568000	573000	And it just, unfortunately, there's no way to non-pluralize credit card theft.
573000	574000	Sorry.
574000	577000	It could sound, it's a plural statement, you know, no matter how you look at it.
577000	579000	You know, so that's a problem.
579000	581000	The American, with the English language, I guess.
581000	584000	But anyway, that's number two.
584000	590000	Number three, where my Deutsche Bank, I felt that, where Bill B,
590000	593000	sorry, look at my notes, paragraph three.
593000	594000	Okay.
594000	599000	So it's, I just wrote down extremely reductive way of describing my father's role within
599000	600000	the bank.
600000	602000	He was a chief risk optimization officer.
602000	609000	David writes that my dad was a, David writes, they talked Deutsche Bank.
609000	611000	Are we talking about the third paragraph of the story here?
611000	612000	Yes.
612000	615000	They wanted to talk about Deutsche Bank, one of the world's largest, most troubled
615000	616000	financial institutions.
616000	617000	Third paragraph?
617000	618000	Yeah.
618000	619000	I'm reading it.
619000	620000	Yeah.
620000	624000	Since late father, Bill had been a senior executive there, and his son possessed the
624000	625000	cash of confidentiality.
625000	626000	Okay.
626000	631000	So I wrote that this was a way, too reductive, that my father's role was other than a,
631000	632000	instead of saying a senior.
632000	636000	I want to hear, I want to hear anything in a way, which I started with an anchor, but
636000	639000	if not, you're going to edit our story that's online.
639000	640000	I'm not trying to.
640000	641000	Again, again, Nick.
641000	642000	I need to be very clear with you.
642000	643000	Yeah.
643000	644000	Nick, I'm not, I'm not trying to.
644000	645000	Given how short time is.
645000	646000	Yeah, sorry.
646000	648000	Given how short time is, I'll be very straight.
648000	649000	Yeah.
649000	653000	I want to know everything that might be faxed along with the story, but this piece has
653000	658000	been up for so long, even if it's only been up for one minute, you will not edit the story.
658000	659000	I know.
659000	667000	There's no point at which you say that, you know, if we say, if we said that a, that a
667000	670000	pizza was warm and you prefer us to say that pizza was hot.
670000	671000	I know.
671000	672000	I know.
672000	673000	I know.
673000	677000	Dude, you got me, dude, you got me pegged wrong.
677000	679000	I'm not at all trying to do that.
679000	683000	I'm just wanting to say that my father was a chief risk optimization officer.
683000	684000	That's his title.
684000	685000	That is a senior executive.
685000	686000	Okay.
686000	687000	So that's accurate.
687000	688000	That's it.
688000	689000	Okay.
689000	690000	Fine.
690000	691000	That's all I'm trying to say.
691000	692000	If you know, I'm not, I don't want to argue that with you.
692000	695000	It's, I just thought that was a, an issue.
695000	696000	Okay.
696000	697000	Paragraph four.
697000	699000	One, two, three, four.
699000	700000	Sorry.
700000	701000	Trump and DB.
701000	702000	That's, I never mind.
702000	703000	No.
703000	707000	Number five, David introduces the FBI agents without explaining the direct quotes.
707000	712000	So my, my problem here is that, uh, I guess David told you how we got these direct quotes,
712000	713000	right?
713000	721000	I would rather not talk about the particulars of any of that.
721000	728000	Uh, well, that's, it's an issue for me because, uh, I guess I don't know if people, if someone
728000	737000	has a proper, you know, uh, what's the word, uh, uh, deductive reasoning, they can say,
737000	741000	well, how is David possibly quoting, uh, the FBI agents?
741000	742000	He wasn't there.
742000	746000	Um, and Val, maybe did he take notes or was it recorded?
746000	747000	Right.
747000	748000	So clearly.
748000	753000	A reader might wonder why there is verbatim dialogue from a, from a closed room.
753000	754000	Precisely.
754000	757000	So that, that's a problem for me that could, uh, put me in, get me in trouble.
757000	758000	Uh, sorry.
758000	761000	Let me, somebody keeps calling.
761000	763000	Uh, uh, hello.
763000	764000	Can you hear me?
764000	765000	Hi.
765000	766000	Oh, sorry.
766000	768000	Uh, and, and he said, hello.
768000	769000	Hello, Nick.
769000	770000	Can you hear me?
770000	771000	Oh no.
771000	772000	Nick.
772000	773000	Nick.
773000	774000	Nick.
774000	775000	Sorry.
775000	776000	Can you hear me?
776000	777000	Uh, give me one second.
777000	786000	I, I, I gotta put you back on.
786000	787000	I'm sorry.
787000	788000	One second, Nick.
788000	789000	Hold on.
789000	790000	I gotta fix this.
790000	794000	I put you back on, uh, the speaker so I can, can you hear me now?
794000	795000	Nick.
795000	796000	Now I can hear you much worse.
796000	797000	Oh, I'm sorry.
797000	798000	Uh, is this any better now?
798000	799000	Hello.
799000	800000	Yeah.
800000	801000	That's good.
801000	802000	Oh, perfect.
802000	803000	Good.
803000	804000	Okay.
804000	805000	Uh, so, so that was an issue for me that could get me into a lot of trouble.
805000	807000	I don't know if I have anything, any say that.
807000	809000	Is there any way around that?
809000	810000	Uh, I don't know.
810000	813000	I just wanted to let you know that that was kind of an issue for me.
813000	814000	That's it.
814000	821000	So my understanding is that we were a bit awkward or something.
821000	822000	I don't want to discuss.
822000	823000	I know.
823000	824000	I know.
824000	825000	It's tricky.
825000	826000	David's sourcing on a call.
826000	831000	I assume you're recording this and I don't want to say anything that, you know, you understand
831000	836000	how closely journalists keep their sources of information and I don't.
836000	840000	I am the source, but I'm telling you, I am the source so you don't have to hide.
840000	842000	I mean, everyone knows it's me.
842000	847000	I'm the source, but I am afraid that that is people keep texting.
847000	848000	Okay.
848000	854000	But I'm afraid you want to, if you gave this dialogue to David, did David not have permission
854000	855000	to use it?
855000	857000	No, I gave him permission to use.
857000	858000	Oh, wait.
858000	859000	What is your objection here?
859000	865000	No, my objection is, uh, is there a way to disguise with and still tell the truth?
865000	870000	Uh, this my sourcing that I'm the source of this one.
870000	871000	Okay.
871000	877000	I'm not going to edit it because of your, you know, just things you would prefer.
877000	879000	Second, just candidly.
879000	880000	Yeah.
880000	884000	Uh, if we think to change, it would bring so much more attention to that.
884000	885000	Right.
885000	886000	Right.
886000	887000	Right.
887000	888000	With that thing, the Streisand effect.
888000	889000	Right.
889000	890000	Okay.
890000	892000	You draw attention to what you hope not to.
892000	893000	Yeah.
893000	895000	Uh, people look for changes to New York Times copy.
895000	896000	Um, I got you.
896000	897000	It's really moving.
897000	902000	I'm not going to be editing this piece because of a preference that you have.
902000	903000	Okay.
903000	906000	Again, didn't have to say that, but I get it.
906000	907000	Um, I get it.
907000	908000	All right.
908000	909000	It makes sense.
909000	910000	All right.
910000	914000	Um, and I didn't think about that until you just said it and that actually makes perfect
914000	915000	sense.
915000	916000	All right.
916000	917000	Um, let's see.
917000	918000	For five years.
918000	919000	Okay.
919000	923000	So this one's where it sort of starts becoming more subjective and offensive.
923000	927000	So for five, for more than five years, Val Brooksman, this is paragraph.
927000	928000	Sorry.
928000	930000	Uh, I got it.
930000	932000	I guess like numbers five or six.
932000	936000	The quote is for more than five years, Val Brooksman has been dangling his Deutsche Bank
936000	939000	files in front of journalists and government investigators.
939000	943000	Quote, dreaming on becoming the next great American whistleblower.
943000	945000	I've never said anything.
945000	950000	I've never said that to any human being in my entire life that I've never even crossed
950000	952000	my mind to become the next great American whistleblower.
952000	956000	That is very, very strange thing that David would write.
956000	959000	It's very, I don't know what to say.
959000	965000	It's just like the beginning of, uh, of this sort of painting, uh, the terrible picture
965000	966000	of me.
966000	969000	Um, so I take great umbrage with that.
969000	974000	Um, number two, you want, uh, Val quote unquote, dot, dot, dot.
974000	979000	Val wants to expose what he sees as corporate wrongdoing, give, give some meaning to his
979000	982000	father's death, dash, and maybe get famous along the way.
982000	983000	Okay.
983000	986000	I'm still like shivering with anger when I read that now.
986000	990000	Number one, I never wanted to expose any corporate wrongdoings.
990000	991000	That was not my goal.
991000	994000	All I wanted to do was solve the mystery of my father's death.
994000	995000	That's it.
995000	996000	I had one goal.
996000	1000000	There was no like, let's expose Deutsche Bank and drop JP.
1000000	1001000	No, none of that shit.
1001000	1002000	I didn't care about that shit.
1002000	1004000	All I want to know is why the fuck did my dad kill himself?
1004000	1005000	That's it.
1005000	1006000	All right.
1006000	1011000	My intention was to solve this, this, this murder that I thought, you know, at that time,
1011000	1013000	I thought he was murdered.
1013000	1015000	So it really is.
1015000	1019000	And that, and that last sentence, get famous along the way is so infuriating.
1019000	1024000	I never, anyone that knows me never will never say that wants to be famous.
1024000	1030000	I'm like, this, this famous thing is, is really, uh, if anything, the projections of David putting
1030000	1034000	it onto me, if anything, I mean, I can't believe that he would say something so ridiculous.
1034000	1035000	And absurd.
1035000	1040000	Um, and I'm sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah, sorry, I'm, I'm angry.
1040000	1041000	Sorry.
1041000	1042000	Yeah.
1042000	1045000	You know, these are, this is legitimate complaint.
1045000	1048000	I think, you know, we should, you should write a letter to the editor.
1048000	1051000	You should, you should say that you, that you can do this.
1051000	1052000	Um, sorry.
1052000	1053000	I'm just getting that.
1053000	1054000	I get angry.
1054000	1055000	Sorry.
1055000	1058000	You can, you can take to Twitter and say that you, you know, you disagree.
1058000	1059000	Yeah.
1059000	1060000	Strongly with this characterization.
1060000	1063000	Um, you know, and I think, um, yeah.
1063000	1070000	It's certainly, you know, you, you have options that you're at your disposal and disregard.
1070000	1071000	Okay.
1071000	1073000	And so I'm just bringing that up to you.
1073000	1078000	And so I did not know I had options and, uh, I'm, I do know obviously Twitter is an option.
1078000	1082000	I just didn't know I had a, you're not the editors.
1082000	1086000	If I write a letter to the other, which I would love to do, can I give that to you?
1086000	1088000	Is there a way to jump this queue a little bit?
1088000	1090000	There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a single inbox.
1090000	1094000	It's just, uh, letter to the editor is just, you're pretty sophisticated media consumer
1094000	1095000	about it.
1095000	1099000	I'm surprised that you're not familiar with that letter to the editor.
1099000	1100000	Yeah.
1100000	1101000	I've never done it.
1101000	1102000	So I've never done it before.
1102000	1105000	It's a large address that anybody can email.
1105000	1106000	Is there a way to jump the queue?
1106000	1111000	I'm asking since the story just came out and, you know, if it's like a five months later,
1111000	1112000	no one's going to care.
1112000	1117000	Whoever, whoever edits that, that, that thing, the space where we run letters to the editor,
1117000	1121000	they read every, every note, there's, you know, they, they're, they're pretty, they're
1121000	1122000	pretty good.
1122000	1123000	I'm sure.
1123000	1128000	Um, so I wouldn't worry about being down, down in a queue or something.
1128000	1129000	Okay.
1129000	1130000	Then I'll give that a go.
1130000	1131000	Um,
1131000	1133000	Letters at NY times.com.
1133000	1135000	Uh, let me just get a pen.
1135000	1136000	Oh, I can remember that.
1136000	1137000	Letters at NY times.com.
1137000	1138000	That's easy.
1138000	1139000	If you Google it, it comes up immediately.
1139000	1140000	Okay.
1140000	1141000	All right.
1141000	1142000	Perfect.
1142000	1143000	Um, uh, okay.
1143000	1145000	So I got through that one.
1145000	1147000	Um, I pulled, okay.
1147000	1149000	Uh, and maybe get famous along the way.
1149000	1150000	I got that.
1150000	1151000	I pulled them more than anyone.
1151000	1156000	So David says, um, uh, in gosh, was that paragraph seven?
1156000	1159000	Uh, we've got your holding documents.
1159000	1165000	Should David says, basically, he said, quote unquote, he pulled, I pulled them more than
1165000	1169000	anyone saying he pulled my strings more than anyone.
1169000	1172000	Um, and I just had took a problem with that.
1172000	1177000	So what I wrote here was an egotistical sentence, self-elevating and highly condescending words.
1177000	1181000	Again, showing David's inner workings more than mine.
1181000	1187000	Um, just this, this, this is the characterization of me is getting more and more, uh, uh, reductive
1187000	1190000	to, uh, a point of a cliche now.
1190000	1197000	And paragraph eight, he, uh, talks about my drug use and he says between manias and stupors.
1197000	1199000	And I completely inaccurate.
1199000	1203000	I challenged David to show me one mania and one stupor.
1203000	1206000	Once when he, I've spoken with him.
1206000	1208000	I, I don't know where that comes from.
1208000	1216000	It infers that I have this sort of, uh, uh, this bipolar ish mood swing person, which I am not and never have been.
1216000	1219000	And that is sort of another mischaracterization.
1219000	1222000	Um, it's sort of a, you know, okay.
1222000	1225000	The quote, he has a maddening, same paragraph.
1225000	1230000	There's a maddening habit of leaping to outrageous conclusions and then bending facts to fit Farfetch theories.
1230000	1233000	He fantasizes about seeing his story told by Hollywood.
1233000	1237000	And I sometimes wonder whether he's manipulating me to achieve that ambition.
1237000	1239000	He can be impatient, erratic and abusive.
1239000	1240000	That's mostly right.
1240000	1241000	Yes.
1241000	1243000	Of course I can be impatient, erratic, abusive.
1243000	1246000	I do bend facts to fit Farfetch theories.
1246000	1249000	Um, but fantasizing about seeing my story in Hollywood.
1249000	1258000	Sort of, uh, this works only to, uh, cement this fame seeking person that he started a few paragraphs ago.
1258000	1260000	And that is the one that really bothers me.
1260000	1264000	Um, uh, it's, it's, it's misleading.
1264000	1266000	It's a self grandiose intention.
1266000	1268000	It's full, it's full.
1268000	1271000	It's, there's something I can't quite put my finger on it.
1271000	1277000	I don't know how to describe it, but it's, look, okay, Nick, when David came to see me before there was a book,
1277000	1282000	before there was, uh, the New York Times okayed the article the first time around a year ago.
1282000	1287000	Uh, David came to visit me in Los Angeles and he, uh, said,
1287000	1290000	we're talking about my story and says this would be a perfect film.
1290000	1292000	This would be a great idea for a Netflix series.
1292000	1294000	And I said, yeah, of course.
1294000	1299000	So he signed, he gave me a book of his, the library book, a hard copy because I requested one.
1299000	1305000	And he signed it for me and he wrote, um, uh, where is he, I wrote it somewhere.
1305000	1308000	Let me get it to my little library.
1308000	1312000	He wrote to me just to show you that this whole Hollywood thing is not me.
1312000	1314000	Val, enjoy the book.
1314000	1318000	I can't wait to tell your story and all the cinematic glory that it deserves.
1318000	1320000	This is during our conversation.
1320000	1323000	That's, I have it inscribed in the book that he gave me.
1323000	1324000	Okay.
1324000	1327000	So he's been pushing this Hollywood thing way before.
1327000	1332000	You did not have any Hollywood dreams and there's more David's Hollywood dreams than, than yours.
1332000	1339000	I'm saying, I, everyone has Hollywood dreams, but I'm saying mine are no, uh, no greater or less than anyone else's.
1339000	1340000	That's it.
1340000	1344000	Um, and it's not something that needs to be, uh, pushed.
1344000	1351000	All races with, with David want, you know, my understanding from him is that one of the reasons you had moved out west was to, I think as we say in the story,
1351000	1353000	turn up Hollywood interest in your story.
1353000	1354000	Yeah.
1354000	1356000	I, I, I, you know.
1356000	1357000	That's fine.
1357000	1358000	That's perfect.
1358000	1359000	I know that's perfectly okay.
1359000	1360000	That sentence was okay.
1360000	1365000	Cause that is true, but the characterization, because the characterization
1365000	1367000	may be getting famous along the way.
1367000	1368000	Yeah.
1368000	1373000	But that's, that's the way that's, you know, of course everyone was like, Oh, well, life will be like if you're famous, et cetera.
1373000	1380000	This is a common, uh, notion amongst every, every human being basically, but, but the character.
1380000	1381000	I understand.
1381000	1382000	Are you saying that it is accurate?
1382000	1383000	No.
1383000	1384000	No.
1384000	1389000	One of the reasons you moved to LA was to turn up Hollywood interest in your story, but you were not interested in getting famous.
1389000	1393000	No, that's, of course, of course, no, of course in fame comes along with that.
1393000	1394000	No, that's not what I'm saying.
1394000	1401000	I'm saying that is accurate, but the characterization and the repetitive nature of saying this guy wants, all he wants to be is famous.
1401000	1407000	That is a pejorative that is, uh, constantly, it's a theme in this, uh, article.
1407000	1410000	I mean, it's, it's, it's almost every third paragraph.
1410000	1414000	There's something about Val's trying to push his own agenda of being famous.
1414000	1415000	I mean, it's like, what the hell?
1415000	1417000	I'm not this, this is disturbing.
1417000	1419000	It's, it disturbs me.
1419000	1420000	Okay.
1420000	1431000	And I just want to point that out that it's like to dwell on that over and over again is really, it gets sticks in the back of someone's head and say, Oh, this is one of those fame seeking assholes, you know, which I am not.
1431000	1433000	Um, you can, uh,
1433000	1437000	Before we move on, you know, you raise this line.
1437000	1438000	Um,
1438000	1439000	Um,
1439000	1440000	Where is it?
1440000	1441000	Um,
1441000	1443000	Um,
1443000	1445000	How raiders conclusions, bending facts.
1445000	1446000	Um,
1446000	1447000	Yeah.
1447000	1448000	You know,
1448000	1451000	There's also this thing about, uh, a brokerage account.
1451000	1452000	Um,
1452000	1453000	Yes.
1453000	1459000	So if I look at your Twitter page right now, am I going to see a screenshot that is that you claim is,
1459000	1460000	Oh, that's a joke.
1460000	1461000	Yes.
1461000	1464000	Because David wrote, he knows it's a joke.
1464000	1465000	I mean,
1465000	1466000	You know,
1466000	1467000	Yeah.
1467000	1469000	I think David's concern is that, uh,
1469000	1473000	Very few people will think that it is a joke and that, um,
1473000	1474000	Well,
1474000	1477000	He certainly didn't take it as a joke when you were originally telling him about it.
1477000	1480000	Uh, he thought that you were being serious.
1480000	1483000	I mean, he, he, he thought what we described in the story.
1483000	1484000	Yeah, I couldn't believe that.
1484000	1489000	That was, that was astonishing to me that David thought that I actually had done that.
1489000	1490000	But, you know,
1490000	1491000	Whatever.
1491000	1492000	What can I do?
1492000	1493000	And in this,
1493000	1494000	And if you read this article,
1494000	1495000	I think anyone that has
1495000	1496000	Is your,
1496000	1501000	Is your tweet still up the one saying David is insider trading on all this stuff?
1501000	1502000	Yeah.
1502000	1503000	But that is pretty,
1503000	1504000	Yeah.
1504000	1505000	I'm going to be honest.
1505000	1506000	It's pretty shitty, Val.
1506000	1507000	What?
1507000	1508000	But David said it was hilarious.
1508000	1509000	He tweeted to me.
1509000	1510000	Hilarious.
1510000	1511000	He thought it was funny.
1511000	1512000	Did he really?
1512000	1513000	Yes.
1513000	1514000	As soon as I put it up,
1514000	1515000	I have it right here.
1515000	1516000	Hilarious.
1516000	1517000	I've got it there.
1517000	1518000	Is he being sarcastic?
1518000	1519000	No.
1519000	1520000	He's being sarcastic.
1520000	1521000	Because it is funny.
1521000	1522000	Because in them,
1522000	1524000	And the first thing you read about is Val tried to set me up in this thing.
1524000	1526000	And that's kind of a funny story.
1526000	1527000	It's a funny incident.
1527000	1528000	I get it.
1528000	1529000	So then I put a fake,
1529000	1530000	A thing.
1530000	1531000	So here,
1531000	1533000	Here's David's thing with a smiley face.
1533000	1534000	It's,
1534000	1535000	It's like jokie.
1535000	1536000	It's funny.
1536000	1537000	That's why he said,
1537000	1538000	I have it.
1538000	1539000	I'll show you the screenshot.
1539000	1540000	Whatever you need.
1540000	1541000	It says hilarious.
1541000	1542000	All right.
1542000	1543000	Well, yeah.
1543000	1544000	I mean,
1544000	1545000	If he's texting you that it's hilarious.
1545000	1546000	And he,
1546000	1548000	He's been emailing me saying that he's concerned that people won't think that you're kidding.
1548000	1550000	Because Louis freaking meant,
1550000	1552000	I didn't realize he had texted you something that was hilarious.
1552000	1553000	Yeah.
1553000	1556000	I would kind of guess that he was being sarcastic.
1556000	1557000	Yeah.
1557000	1558000	You know,
1558000	1559000	Don't pull my leg like this.
1559000	1560000	But,
1560000	1561000	No, no, no, no.
1561000	1562000	That's really for you guys to,
1562000	1563000	To work out.
1563000	1564000	Yeah.
1564000	1566000	You just want to say that I consider it shitty.
1566000	1567000	And,
1567000	1568000	You think that's shitty.
1568000	1572000	You're concerned about people believing you and,
1572000	1574000	And thinking highly of you.
1574000	1575000	That's,
1575000	1576000	Okay, Nick.
1576000	1577000	Nick.
1577000	1578000	I get it.
1578000	1579000	I get it.
1579000	1580000	I get the opposite.
1580000	1581000	Thank you, Nick.
1581000	1582000	You should be doing.
1582000	1585000	I thank you for your ethical standpoint and showing me what that is.
1585000	1588000	But if you think it's a matter of taste of humor,
1588000	1590000	And David got it right away.
1590000	1592000	And I think a lot of other people did.
1592000	1595000	I'm happy to put up another statement saying this is obviously a joke.
1595000	1596000	If someone,
1596000	1598000	Whoever takes this seriously clearly did not read the article.
1598000	1599000	That's up to you.
1599000	1600000	I'm not going to add it.
1600000	1601000	I'm happy to.
1601000	1602000	I'm not going to add it.
1602000	1603000	You're twisting your feed.
1603000	1604000	Yeah.
1604000	1605000	You're not going to add it.
1605000	1606000	My story.
1606000	1607000	Next point.
1607000	1608000	Okay.
1608000	1609000	Thank you.
1609000	1611000	So we got,
1611000	1612000	Shit, where are we?
1612000	1613000	Okay.
1613000	1614000	Unaccountable.
1614000	1615000	Uh,
1615000	1616000	Little bit.
1616000	1617000	Okay.
1617000	1618000	So the whole thing that this incident,
1618000	1619000	What is funny in the story.
1619000	1620000	And I,
1620000	1621000	I'm not,
1621000	1624000	I have a matter with it and I don't have an issue with it other than David,
1624000	1628000	It takes it out of context and makes me look like a person that is,
1628000	1629000	Uh,
1629000	1632000	Just kind of a crazy person that is setting up these things.
1632000	1633000	The same things to the brokerage again.
1633000	1635000	Yes, the brokerage account thing.
1635000	1640000	David, I have a whole text message conversation between us.
1640000	1642280	It explains it all, but basically.
1642280	1643600	No, he didn't take it as a joke.
1643600	1644600	I mean, he, like.
1644600	1645440	No, I know, I know.
1645440	1649600	He left his, like, employer at the publisher now, like.
1649600	1650440	Yeah.
1650440	1651760	He did not take it as a joke.
1651760	1652600	I know that now.
1652600	1654120	What happened in the story is exactly how it played out.
1654120	1656480	I know it is, and that's not what I'm saying, Nick.
1656480	1657640	What I'm saying is he took,
1657640	1659960	what he took out of context was the reason why I did it.
1659960	1661800	He just showed something that happened
1661800	1663480	without explaining why.
1663480	1664960	And that's what bothers me.
1664960	1666840	Makes me look like a crazy person
1666840	1668440	when you take something out of context.
1668440	1672360	He took a truth, and it did happen exactly as he said it did.
1672360	1674320	Perfectly recounted.
1674320	1675480	What was the context?
1675480	1677280	The context was.
1677280	1682280	After 20 months of sort of being a donkey looking,
1682360	1684880	staring at a carrot, waiting for this thing to be,
1684880	1687160	this article is supposed to be published a long time ago,
1687160	1688320	a year and a half ago.
1688320	1691840	The book was originally called The Banker's Son.
1691840	1695960	And then I was slowly removed from my own story in my head.
1695960	1697560	And I didn't know what was going on.
1697560	1698880	I didn't know who to believe.
1698880	1703400	But suddenly The Banker's Son became the Dark Towers.
1703400	1705000	And I was in the subtext.
1705000	1707720	The sub, you know, it says like Dark Towers,
1707720	1708720	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
1708720	1710880	whatever that secondary line is called.
1710880	1713440	I was in there, and then I got removed from that.
1713440	1714640	Then there were pictures of me
1714640	1715720	that were supposed to be in the book.
1715720	1719000	Pictures of myself, my father, they got removed.
1719000	1719840	And then there was the-
1719840	1722160	So you sent the brokerage-
1722160	1723000	Hold on, I'm not-
1723000	1723840	I'm not-
1723840	1726840	Because you're upset about being written out of the story?
1726840	1728000	No, I'm not there.
1728000	1728840	I'm not quite,
1728840	1730400	let me finish and I'll tell you and you'll see.
1730400	1731240	Sorry.
1731240	1735760	So over systematically over a series of a year and a half,
1735760	1740480	David, the agreement we had was that this is a book
1740480	1742640	about my story and my father's story.
1742640	1745280	Slowly I'm being removed from my own story.
1745280	1747200	And David is saying, oh, don't worry about it.
1747240	1749600	It's all fine, you're in the story.
1749600	1752320	So if you can imagine the pressure or the feeling
1752320	1756080	of being lied to or being betrayed every few months
1756080	1757640	when something is taken from you.
1757640	1759760	So then the pictures are going.
1759760	1761760	And the blurb, David says, don't worry about it.
1761760	1762760	I'm gonna change the blurb.
1762760	1764640	I'm gonna make your father and you more prominent.
1764640	1767480	He writes me what the blurb is going to be,
1767480	1768920	writes it out completely.
1768920	1771980	And he publishes the blurb, okay,
1771980	1775240	exactly how he sent it to me with one thing missing
1775240	1776880	and that was my name.
1776880	1779280	And I said, David, I sent him a text and David,
1779280	1780160	what the hell's going on?
1780160	1781000	WTF?
1781000	1781960	Well, what is this blurb?
1781960	1784120	You said it was gonna be like you said.
1784120	1786960	And then he said, the thing that set me off was,
1786960	1787920	let me show you the text.
1787920	1788760	Let me just get the text.
1788760	1790760	It was, sorry, word for word.
1790760	1792960	I have to put you on hold for a second,
1792960	1793800	but I'll try not to.
1793800	1795400	The word for word, it was something like,
1796480	1800600	we found that your name added no value to the story.
1800600	1802000	That was what he said that morning
1802000	1803880	before I did the brokerage thing.
1803880	1806480	And that just was the straw that broke
1806480	1807560	the camel's back.
1807560	1809240	My name brings no value to the story.
1809240	1811520	It's my own story, right?
1811520	1814400	So I flipped out and I was the only one awake.
1814400	1815240	Let me say something.
1815240	1817880	Your story says is, a few days ago,
1817880	1819520	I read that he was not named from the blurb
1819520	1822280	for my book on Amazon, among other perceived slides.
1822280	1824720	He sent me a string of text claiming
1824720	1826360	that the brokerage stuff.
1826360	1828320	That seems like an extremely accurate
1828320	1830640	and concise description of the context
1830640	1831800	that you just told me was missing.
1831800	1834920	Wrong, other conceived slides is the problem.
1834920	1838400	That's what's missing, the actual other conceived slides.
1838400	1841040	Otherwise, it looks like I'm a ridiculous person.
1841040	1843040	And David knows that I'm not.
1843040	1845560	So this is, in a sense, everyone starts like,
1845560	1846400	is this guy hate you?
1846400	1847880	Is this a vengeful act that he's done?
1847880	1849880	I don't know if it is because of this incident.
1849880	1850720	I don't know.
1850720	1853000	But I'm telling you, when you say other perceived slides.
1853000	1853840	I'm not sure what you want.
1853840	1856800	You seem to want to have written this story.
1856800	1859800	No, come on, man.
1859800	1861680	No, I don't want to write this story.
1861680	1863000	I don't want to write this story.
1863000	1866920	I just want to not be characterized as an asshole.
1866920	1869200	That's how I'm looked at, like a real dickhead,
1869200	1871520	like a real person that you don't ever want to talk
1871520	1874160	like a nasty fuckhead that I, people, I say,
1874160	1876240	oh my God, that's someone you stay away from.
1876240	1878600	I would tell my girlfriend's kid
1878600	1880040	to stay away from this type of person.
1880040	1881240	Do you understand this?
1881240	1884400	And you say, well, maybe you are that type of person, right?
1884400	1886000	Is what your people tend to think.
1886000	1887720	Well, it's in the New York Times.
1887720	1889720	So you must be that type of person.
1889720	1891000	And that is the problem, Nick.
1891000	1892520	That's what I would like change.
1892560	1895560	Is that my characterization of me by these descriptors
1895560	1897480	that David puts in here, there's not,
1897480	1899800	there's only one non-pejorative.
1899800	1900640	I need to reiterate it again.
1900640	1901880	I'm not going to edit this piece.
1901880	1904320	I know, that's, again, you ask me a question.
1904320	1905360	Is it the way you want to be?
1905360	1906200	You ask me a question.
1906200	1907280	You just want to be described in character.
1907280	1908600	Nick, you ask me a question.
1908600	1909720	I'm answering it, man.
1909720	1912040	I know that you're not going to edit the way I want.
1912040	1914480	I know it, and I'm not trying to get you to, okay?
1914480	1915960	Can we leave that alone for now?
1915960	1917280	I mean, you've said it like 50 times.
1917280	1919600	I'm telling you, I'm not trying to do that.
1919600	1921200	I'm bringing up the issues I have.
1921200	1922040	That's it.
1923160	1924680	You asked me to, and I did it for you.
1924680	1927320	I spent four hours doing this last night, okay?
1927320	1930160	So we can agree to that, please.
1930160	1931520	I'm not trying to do anything else.
1931520	1933360	So it's the characterization of me,
1933360	1934440	and this is another one.
1934440	1938240	There's one, other than the very last sentence
1938240	1940720	of the story, there is one line where he says
1940720	1941560	that I'm fearless.
1941560	1942400	That's it.
1942400	1943240	I need to know what you want here.
1943240	1945640	What are you, do you want to be heard?
1945640	1946480	Do you want to hear?
1946480	1949560	Yeah, I don't really know, Nick.
1949560	1950880	I don't know, I really don't know.
1950880	1953480	Maybe the changes to the story would be great,
1953480	1956000	but I doubt you're not going to do that, so I understand.
1956000	1957800	Maybe I want to be heard, I don't know.
1957800	1960320	I don't know, I just know that something is wrong,
1960320	1962320	and I just want to fix the thing that is wrong.
1962320	1964960	And then, David said, talk to Nick Summers.
1964960	1967440	So here I am talking to you, all right?
1967440	1968800	That's it, I don't know.
1969760	1972880	So this, I can't, I mean, I don't know.
1975320	1979840	Anyway, there's one kind thing that David said,
1979840	1981360	called me fearless, right?
1981360	1983840	And that is the one nice thing he says in the entire book.
1983840	1985000	So this guy's been my friend.
1985000	1987520	I thought this guy was my friend for five years,
1987520	1988560	and this is what I see.
1988560	1990840	So you can imagine my surprise, all right?
1990840	1992800	This is not something that a friend would write
1992800	1995800	about someone that you like, or else it is.
1995800	1997200	I don't know, he's trying to be fair,
1997200	1999240	and he overcompensated on the negativity.
1999240	2000240	Perhaps that's the thing.
2000240	2002080	I don't know what it is,
2002080	2004920	he doesn't really answer that question.
2004920	2009080	But the whole, the entire thing is, is why, sorry,
2009080	2010800	now I'm sort of stuttering now,
2010800	2013360	because I don't know, because I'm kind of upset,
2013360	2016840	but sorry, let me just take a breath, Homer.
2020480	2022880	I feel like it's a pejorative account of me.
2022880	2024720	Anyone that would read this would think
2024720	2027160	that this is not a good person, okay?
2027160	2029360	There is no love, there's no love for my father.
2029360	2033120	There's no love for the reason why I set upon this journey.
2033120	2036720	There's no prime mover or an event that shows
2036720	2038920	that why I did all this stuff.
2039760	2042200	There's no love from David.
2042200	2043960	There's no love from me to my father.
2043960	2047800	There's no thing that has a kindness or shows heart and soul.
2047800	2050280	No heart and soul, it's just negative descriptors
2050280	2051120	and pejoratives.
2052320	2055080	Of course, of course I have.
2055080	2056840	And he says, I don't agree with,
2056840	2059720	I said, he says, I understand your point of view,
2059720	2061720	but I don't agree with your perception.
2062920	2064360	That's what he says.
2064360	2065520	I'm like, what the fuck?
2066800	2068040	That's it, that's it.
2068040	2070280	I'll send you all the freaking screenshots
2070280	2072240	from all our conversations, if you like.
2072240	2075120	I'll show you, it paints a real clear picture,
2075120	2077840	but I might end up just doing that on Twitter.
2077840	2081440	I mean, I don't know, man, I'm just really upset about it.
2081440	2083000	It just keeps going on.
2084080	2084920	I'm almost, and then we go.
2084920	2087560	I'm sorry, and I do mean it, I don't mean any,
2087560	2090520	I can dismiss it, but I'm sorry that this is the,
2090520	2093080	that when you read this, you felt,
2093080	2094680	you've come this characterizing, you felt
2094680	2096280	that there was no love of it.
2096280	2098720	Dude, I was hurt, I was actually hurt.
2098720	2100800	That the one you guys had was not,
2100800	2103320	you know, that it came out of David's pen
2103320	2104720	different than you've been living it.
2104720	2105840	I am sorry for that.
2105840	2106680	Thank you.
2106680	2108400	And, you know.
2108400	2109240	Thank you.
2109240	2110760	I might have an unsatisfying answer, you know.
2110760	2111800	Yeah, I know, I know.
2111800	2112800	I felt, it's hurt.
2112800	2114520	This is David's story to write, this is how he wrote it,
2114520	2116600	and I get it.
2116600	2121600	In terms of like, in terms of the balance of love
2122080	2123320	or anything else,
2126480	2128120	I'm frankly, I'm just not sure what,
2128120	2130280	totally what the sides.
2130280	2131120	Well, you're the editor.
2131120	2133360	That's why I thought, you know, you would find the balance.
2133360	2135360	So Nick, the story comes to you.
2135360	2136680	I get it, I'm not a journalist,
2136680	2138800	but I would guess that the story gets to you,
2138800	2140560	and you're like, well, I like this, I don't like this.
2140560	2141880	Where's the balance?
2141880	2143680	So maybe that's why I'm talking to you.
2143680	2145720	And maybe that's why David gave me to you
2145720	2148760	subconsciously, perhaps said, well, Nick's can be.
2148760	2150080	Yeah, that's what others do, but you know,
2150080	2151880	look, there's no way for, you know.
2151880	2152720	Yeah.
2152720	2154240	David, if the story that we work on together,
2155080	2158320	I can't, one thing that I said,
2158320	2159320	I can't factor, I guess,
2159320	2163120	is the amount of love between you and David.
2163120	2164360	That's something that I,
2164360	2165680	as you can see, that's what I'm talking about.
2165680	2167240	Yeah, I know, again, I don't know why you say that,
2167240	2169080	because obviously that's, I'm not asking you to do that.
2169080	2170360	That's a strange thing to say,
2170360	2172680	but it's the love, there's no balance.
2172680	2175640	It's all negativity of who I am, negativity.
2175640	2176600	That's it.
2176600	2179760	It's about, I'm not painted equally.
2179760	2181000	This is, again, more into like,
2181000	2182520	the sort of thing you can put in,
2182600	2183760	and I'll let her see the editor,
2183760	2187640	or frankly, more people will read
2187640	2188760	what you have to say about this
2188760	2191040	if you put it on Twitter than I'll let her see the editor.
2191040	2192640	So the editor has all kinds of work,
2192640	2196400	count limits, and it's got to be formal,
2196400	2199560	you know, on Twitter, you can do whatever you want.
2201360	2202840	Okay.
2202840	2205680	You are, you're pretty sophisticated.
2205680	2208680	Person who interacts with many different parts
2208680	2210360	of the news media,
2210360	2213360	and you have ways of getting your story out.
2213360	2215320	I know, but I don't want to do that, man.
2215320	2216360	I like the New York Times.
2216360	2218080	You guys are my favorite painter,
2218080	2221200	painter, sorry, my favorite newspaper.
2221200	2224680	And David, I always thought was a talented writer, you know,
2224680	2226760	and I like you guys, I like this family.
2226760	2228840	I don't want to go against you guys.
2228840	2230400	I want to work things out.
2230400	2232520	That's why I'm trying, that's why I'm calling, man.
2232520	2234440	You know, if I wanted to be an asshole.
2234440	2238320	And I think, and I have to give you the answer
2238320	2242040	that there really is no process of working this out.
2242040	2246280	Like I'm not gonna, we're not gonna change the piece now
2246280	2248360	or at any point post publication
2248360	2251520	because of, you know, a certain way
2251520	2252880	you want them to characterize.
2252880	2254360	Right, again, it's not because,
2254360	2255640	that's not what I'm asking for.
2255640	2257320	Once again, Nick, you keep saying that.
2257320	2259680	I don't want something written the way I want it.
2259680	2260840	I'm not asking for that.
2260840	2262960	I'm asking just for the truth to be portrayed
2262960	2264320	and for balance and fairness.
2264320	2265160	That's what I'm asking.
2265160	2267820	And what I'm doing is pointing out the unbalancedness,
2267820	2270140	the unbalanced parts of this and the mistruths
2270140	2271700	and the inaccuracies.
2271700	2274980	I'm not sure what it is you're asking me for.
2274980	2276940	Well, the way, because when you say story changed,
2276940	2278940	it sounds, again, the way you put it is that
2278940	2281380	we're not gonna change it the way you want it, Val.
2281380	2283380	Right, again, that sounds like an asshole saying,
2283380	2284980	I want you to do what I want to do.
2284980	2286300	That's not what I'm asking.
2286300	2288260	What I'm asking is for you to look at it
2288260	2290540	from my point of view and you're the editor.
2290540	2291380	You've never talked to me.
2291380	2294380	You never met me before other than today and yesterday, right?
2294380	2296740	And now you have a bit more understanding
2296780	2300260	of who I am and how I speak based on my verbiage.
2300260	2302980	Everything is subconsciously of your brains
2302980	2304100	like a supercomputer.
2304100	2306380	You're understanding me a little bit better, right?
2306380	2309020	So now that you've done that and you read this piece
2309020	2312540	and you see a difference, I'm sure,
2312540	2315420	a schism between what David wrote
2315420	2317820	and what you are experiencing now.
2317820	2319220	I don't know what I do, no.
2319220	2320780	Well, maybe you haven't, but not yet,
2320780	2322960	but it'll grow, believe me.
2323900	2325340	So the point is the-
2325340	2327860	I have to tell you about it's so far it's not growing.
2327860	2328700	I want to be honest.
2328700	2331740	I know it's not, it doesn't change about the,
2331740	2335460	what prompted the tracks about the brokerage account.
2335460	2336780	Yeah, yeah.
2336780	2339820	Because that's what David described it specifically.
2339820	2343260	Nick, I get it, you're backing up your writers,
2343260	2345540	you're loyal to David, David's loyalty, I get it.
2345540	2346380	I understand that.
2346380	2347780	I'm not trying to breach that loyalty.
2347780	2349980	I'm not trying to get between you guys.
2349980	2351380	I'm not trying to create a problem.
2351380	2352940	I'm trying to tell you that this,
2352940	2355260	I feel mischaracterized and why.
2356180	2357860	Just doing the same thing I did
2357860	2359860	when I first called you, all right?
2359860	2361460	I'm not asking you to change it
2361460	2363940	based on how I want it to be.
2363940	2366220	If you could change it to make things fair and correct,
2366220	2367300	that would be great.
2367300	2369420	And correct the things that are inaccurate
2369420	2373180	and that have a factually inaccurate, that'd be great.
2373180	2376460	Well, no, no, but you did say that unemployed musician,
2376460	2378780	that is something, at the very beginning, Nick,
2378780	2380180	you said, well, we're going to print soon.
2380180	2381860	So let's get through this now
2381860	2384100	in case we do have to make changes, right?
2384100	2386460	That was the whole reason why we're talking.
2386460	2388140	So that's why we're not talking tomorrow.
2388140	2390140	I've made a couple of bullet points.
2390140	2392060	I've not been writing down certain things
2392060	2395420	that were issued a matter of opinion or interpretation.
2395420	2397420	I wrote down the first bullet point I've written down
2397420	2400060	was this unemployed bassist, he was self-employed.
2400060	2401420	I mean, that was David.
2401420	2402260	Great, okay.
2402260	2404380	If I get off this one, the sooner I can raise it with him.
2404380	2405340	Yeah, that's fine.
2405340	2406420	Let's get through it then.
2406420	2407980	I just don't know why you're arguing with me.
2407980	2410300	All I want to do is tell you my side story.
2410300	2411980	These are the points that I've found out.
2411980	2413580	You can just let it go or leave it,
2413580	2415700	but instead you're like, I want to fight with me.
2415700	2416620	I don't understand it.
2416620	2418620	I just, I don't know what's going on anymore.
2418620	2420260	I'm very confused.
2420260	2421980	I'm just trying to tell you the things
2421980	2423940	that we agreed to yesterday.
2423940	2425300	And you said, do this.
2425300	2426820	And I said, okay, I'll do it.
2426820	2427940	I spent four hours doing it.
2427940	2431940	So here I am, relaying my homework to you, basically.
2431940	2433300	And you want to fight me on every little thing.
2433300	2435620	I'm not trying to do anything here, man.
2435620	2437460	I don't want to get the impression that I'm fighting it.
2437460	2439940	What I'm trying to do is steer us only towards
2441420	2443220	factual things that we've got wrong
2443500	2445820	that we can change with anything else.
2445820	2448060	I'm just not going to change things based on...
2448060	2448900	Okay, I got it.
2448900	2450100	You know what I'm about to say.
2450100	2451900	Yeah, I know what you're going to do.
2451900	2453620	But that's another thing that I'm learning right now.
2453620	2455380	I had no idea that that was,
2455380	2456740	that something that cannot be done,
2456740	2458820	that you can change the factual era,
2458820	2461180	but you cannot change a mischaracterization.
2461180	2462820	I didn't know that, but now I've learned that.
2462820	2463660	Okay?
2463660	2468580	I really thought that Rolling Stone does a cover story
2468580	2470660	about a movie star and then there would be star calls
2470660	2472180	and it says A, B, and C,
2472180	2475460	and then they changed the story to reflect A, B, and C.
2475460	2476300	I don't know, man.
2476300	2478940	I've never, I've never been in this situation.
2478940	2479940	When it comes to media,
2479940	2483500	and I would assume you would know that, you know,
2483500	2485460	journalists are the ones who write the stories.
2485460	2486300	Yeah, I know.
2486300	2487140	Nick.
2487140	2490100	Don't get ahead of it after the fact.
2490100	2491100	Yeah, but sometimes they do
2491100	2493100	when there's something that is inaccurate
2493100	2494660	that I've seen happen before.
2494660	2496460	And I've never been in this situation.
2496460	2498740	It's a very unique, strange place to be right now.
2498740	2500300	I've never been profiled before.
2501020	2502180	Yeah, I've never been in any of this.
2502180	2503020	This is very odd
2503020	2504060	and I don't know how to react.
2504060	2505700	I'm doing the best I can, man.
2505700	2506540	Right?
2506540	2509060	So please bear with me on that.
2509860	2510700	Okay.
2513700	2514540	I don't know how to describe it,
2514540	2517860	but the whole thing is like a very hurtful, basically.
2517860	2520900	Like in a hugely public format.
2522180	2523740	And that's sort of...
2523740	2525340	Yeah, honestly, I can't.
2525340	2529620	I mean, I totally get that.
2529620	2531700	I mean, it's crazy to be written about
2531700	2532940	in a publication this large,
2532940	2535500	so I do want to hear your concerns.
2535500	2536340	Okay.
2540620	2542580	So the next paragraph is,
2542580	2543940	so why do I put up with this?
2543940	2547980	Is David says, and I already responded to that on Twitter,
2547980	2549820	but just for the record, I'll tell you,
2549820	2552900	it's extremely condescending to say,
2552900	2555300	why do I put up with this person
2555300	2557700	that I've just described to you as a terrible person?
2557700	2560260	Because he's got emails that I need, right?
2560260	2562100	That was his basic thing.
2562100	2563020	And that's kind of funny.
2563020	2563860	It's interesting.
2563860	2567820	And I don't take any offense at that.
2567820	2570420	I think it's a funny way of saying,
2570420	2572160	Val's got good info,
2573060	2575900	but I just want to also add that it does
2575900	2579140	sustain the previous characterizations,
2579140	2582060	what I perceive as mischaracterizations.
2582060	2586820	I said, there's another sentence in that same paragraph,
2587460	2589220	besides, there's something uncanny
2589220	2591900	about how Mr. Brooksmouth's fearlessness
2591900	2594740	and addiction to drama, dot, dot, dot.
2594740	2596540	I forgot what comes after drama.
2596540	2598500	Of course, it's kind that he wrote, I'm fearless.
2598500	2599380	That's a very good thing.
2599380	2602940	Finally, one positive note.
2602940	2604940	When you say, David said something kind,
2604940	2606740	fearlessness, that's all I got.
2606740	2608580	And then he goes and spoils it all by saying,
2608580	2609740	I'm addicted to drama.
2609740	2611580	And I'm saying, he knows me better than this.
2611580	2613620	And this is hurtful to me because he knows
2613620	2615580	I'm not addicted to drama.
2615580	2617380	I was caught up in a series of events
2617380	2618540	outside of my control.
2618540	2621580	My father killed himself and I went to go solve
2621580	2623060	the mystery of his death.
2623060	2626100	I did not seek out any drama.
2626100	2628540	This is thrust upon me, right?
2628540	2629660	All this shit was thrown at me.
2629660	2632780	The Sony hack, I asked the hackers,
2632780	2634820	yes, can you hack Deutsche Bank for me?
2634820	2636340	That's not seeking drama.
2636340	2639180	So that's the thing that's a mischaracterization.
2639180	2642060	Again, this person that David's creating,
2642060	2643060	that is not me.
2643940	2648460	I was, I mean, to say I'm in pursuit of fame
2648460	2651140	and attention to drama, it's a singular dismissive.
2651140	2656140	It's also very hurtful and reductively terrible thing
2656140	2658660	to do to anybody, let alone someone
2658660	2661260	that you thought was a friend for five years, okay?
2663460	2667220	So the next part is the same, hold on.
2668220	2674220	Okay, so the same thing here in the next paragraph.
2674220	2678500	We might wish our whistleblowers were stoic,
2678500	2680140	unimpeachable do-gooders.
2680140	2682540	In reality, to let you in on a journalist's secret,
2682540	2685100	they're more often like Val Brooksman.
2685100	2688180	And I mean, this is something that's really stupid to say,
2688180	2690460	show, don't tell, you know, like who is Val Brooksman?
2690460	2692180	So when he says more like Val Brooksman,
2692180	2695940	at this point in the story, where he's shown, okay,
2695940	2698740	is a drug addict, credit card fraud,
2699900	2704820	just negative descriptors, manic, unreliable,
2704820	2708580	all this shit, you take 30, 40 negative things
2708580	2711380	and plain balance them against one word, fearlessness.
2711380	2715100	It does not help, it's not fair, it's not at all fair.
2715100	2718620	Anyway, the next thing, angry, sorry.
2718620	2720980	And then he says I'm angry, I'm slurring my speech,
2720980	2723620	insisting without evidence that he knew why his,
2723620	2726140	I called him, so I think this is the same paragraph.
2726140	2729300	I call him and I have in quotes, dot, dot, dot,
2729300	2731060	angry, slurring his speech,
2731060	2734100	insisting without evidence that he knew why his father
2734100	2736460	had killed himself and that had nothing to do
2736460	2737900	with Deutsche Bank.
2737900	2740740	So again, slur is an allusion to drunkenness,
2740740	2742980	you know, of some sort of inebriation.
2742980	2744700	And I'm saying like right now, really,
2744700	2747820	he's gonna bring up more drugs again, right?
2747820	2750060	Without a statement is very dismissive
2750060	2753300	and an emphasis in the absence of my credibility.
2753300	2757860	It's just again, I say these things and I call them,
2757860	2761380	it's again, another pejorative basically, you know.
2761380	2764980	And by the way, this is not factual
2764980	2769660	because I did not speak to David until early March, 2014.
2769660	2771260	That's the first time I ever spoke to him.
2771260	2773660	I did in fact email him before that
2773660	2776180	and his email is absolutely correct.
2776180	2778460	But then he says I sort of, I picked up the phone
2778460	2782500	or before long I was talking to him
2782540	2785580	and slurring my speech, insisting, et cetera, et cetera,
2785580	2788220	my dad killed himself and nothing to do with Deutsche.
2788220	2792180	Yes, I did tell him that I think I know
2792180	2794220	why my father killed himself and that's probably,
2794220	2795460	and it was because of my mother,
2795460	2797420	is what I was telling him at that part.
2797420	2800060	But when he says there's nothing to do with Deutsche
2800060	2803780	and the slur and the drunkenness, sorry, sorry, I'm getting,
2804860	2806660	sorry, hold on a second, Nick.
2807460	2812460	So I was in rehab from March till July, 2014.
2812780	2815500	So when I spoke to David for the first time,
2815500	2818020	he called me when I was in rehab.
2818020	2820740	So there's no way that I was drunk
2820740	2822340	and I was slurring my speech.
2822340	2826300	So the illusion to this drunkenness is just inaccurate.
2827300	2829580	And I can prove that a million different ways.
2830460	2833540	That's when we started our relationship.
2833540	2837180	When I was in rehab in Altamira in Sausalito,
2837180	2841980	and I sent him a photo of the building that was on fire,
2841980	2845260	which he said was randomly, again, in the story.
2845260	2846340	You're a little over the place.
2846340	2847660	No, I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry.
2847660	2849300	Would you particular thing do you want me to be
2849300	2850140	focused on here?
2850140	2852740	I'm sorry, man, yeah, you're right.
2852740	2856180	Just, okay, I guess the factual,
2856180	2859660	the part that I guess is most important to you
2859660	2863460	would be the factual and the, sorry, man.
2863460	2865300	God, I need like a break.
2865300	2866980	Can I call you in five minutes?
2866980	2867820	Is it okay?
2868900	2870100	It's terrible, I know.
2872380	2873900	I know, I know, it's terrible.
2876900	2878900	Okay, all right, so let me get through this.
2880980	2883100	I know, let me do the quick version.
2883100	2883940	I'll get through this.
2883940	2886300	I'll get through this, I'm sorry.
2886300	2887140	Yeah, yeah.
2890500	2893340	You know, you shared a lot of your life with David
2893340	2895460	for many years.
2895460	2896420	You opened yourself up.
2896420	2897980	We wrote about you in the New York Times.
2897980	2899420	That's a huge thing, and I want to make sure
2899420	2900420	that you feel heard.
2900420	2905020	I, can I, but I just do want to,
2905020	2906540	well, I guess I just be repeating myself.
2906540	2910220	I, you know, you know what I'm gonna say about
2910220	2911100	how we're not gonna change.
2911100	2914260	Right, I know, I know, I know.
2914260	2919260	So, I do want to make sure that you feel heard,
2920100	2923100	and you should definitely know that I'm gonna
2923100	2924620	share all this with David.
2924620	2926620	Please do, yes, please do, of course.
2926620	2927940	But I don't, but I want to make sure
2927940	2930340	that you have realistic expectations about
2930340	2933460	some alterations to the story.
2933460	2935860	Of course, dude, I have no expectations at all.
2935860	2938180	So that's, that's how I'm going into this.
2938180	2940220	I just want to be heard, and then you leave it all
2940220	2941620	in your hands, you know.
2942740	2944180	If you're gonna take a break now,
2944180	2946460	if I could make a suggestion, it would be to
2946460	2949340	make an organized list of your objections
2949340	2950340	with the story.
2950340	2951180	Right, right.
2951180	2953580	And put them in groups, because I'm definitely,
2953580	2958580	I'm so much more assumed to, you know,
2958620	2962620	to Aaron's effect or something where you really disagree
2962620	2965540	with something and can show why it's demonstrably false.
2965540	2968500	Right, right, again, I'm sorry, yeah.
2968500	2971460	We could group all the stuff about, you know,
2971460	2974300	you know, what you see as an embellishing,
2974300	2976220	you know, negative and positive attributes.
2976220	2977060	Okay.
2977060	2979940	That group of stuff, you know, I can listen to it,
2979940	2982820	but that's probably where there's just gonna be no
2982820	2983980	satisfaction. I got you.
2983980	2985340	I got you, and I apologize.
2985340	2987140	I'm usually not like all over the place,
2987140	2989300	but again, it's just because I'm gonna get all emotional.
2989300	2991900	Usually when I talk, I'm not emotionally attached
2991900	2993620	to the material, you know.
2993620	2996940	So that's why, but yeah, sorry, just give me five minutes
2996940	2999020	and I'll call you right back, and I will do what you said.
2999020	3001940	I'll take out the other parts and make this faster.
3003100	3004060	Okay, all right, thank you.
3004060	3004900	Thanks, Nick.
3004900	3005740	Okay, bye.
3006380	3007300	Thank you, Nick.
3027300	3028300	Ah, ah, ah.
3066220	3087780	Oh f...
3117780	3118780	Fuck.
3118780	3124780	Oh shit, it's the recording.
3124780	3133780	Ah, fuck.
3133780	3153780	Hey, Val.
3153780	3154780	Hey, Nick.
3154780	3155780	Thanks.
3155780	3156780	Sorry about that.
3156780	3161780	I guess a Xanax in a cigarette kind of helps.
3161780	3162780	So, yeah.
3162780	3163780	Phew.
3163780	3165780	Man, I was getting worked up there.
3165780	3166780	Yeah.
3166780	3167780	Sorry about that.
3167780	3168780	So let's go to-
3168780	3170780	You don't have to put us right about anything.
3170780	3171780	Thank you.
3171780	3172780	Okay.
3172780	3173780	Thanks.
3173780	3175780	So I guess we could jump to paragraph 23.
3175780	3181780	I'll skip over the whole why I sent him the picture of the building on fire is not really
3181780	3183780	relevant.
3183780	3189340	So David writes in paragraph 23, four days later, I published an article describing the
3189340	3190780	Fed's concerns period.
3190780	3192780	The bank's shares fell 3%.
3192780	3198440	Mr. Brooksman told me he felt empowered by having dented Georgia's market value by more
3198440	3199780	than one billion.
3199780	3206780	Now, this was kind of not horrifying, but it was disturbing for me to read because
3206780	3211780	David and I have talked about this many times.
3211780	3215780	There are two parts to this, and he only published one part and wrote one part.
3215780	3221780	And part one, yes, I did feel some empowerment or some revenge that I had taken.
3221780	3224780	I was able to swing back and I hit the target.
3224780	3226780	I found purchase, right?
3226780	3232780	But the second part, which David did not write, is that I thought it through and I realized
3232780	3237780	how terrible it was because I had affected people that were not directly tied to Deutsche
3237780	3238780	Bank.
3238780	3239780	These are people's pensions.
3239780	3240780	This was a mortgage.
3240780	3241780	They're homes.
3241780	3242780	They're leases.
3242780	3247780	They're dental insurance, medical insurance, and I realized that that was disturbing to
3247780	3249780	me that I did that.
3249780	3256780	And David never, I mean, that's the second half of me, just as much as that first part
3256780	3261780	of the vengeance is for the first half of me, and it's very indicative of the whole story.
3261780	3263780	Do you know what I mean?
3263780	3268780	Selective truth telling to paint a portrait that David is painting.
3268780	3273780	And I just wanted to let you know that there is, you know, I mean, again, I'm not saying
3273780	3277780	that you're going to change anything, but I just want to make it to show you an example,
3277780	3278780	right?
3278780	3282780	And that bothered me that he just said that it was bothering me.
3282780	3285780	So it's factually inaccurate description of what happened.
3285780	3287780	That is factually inaccurate of what happened.
3287780	3289780	But I don't know.
3289780	3290780	I'm confused.
3290780	3292780	Is that not accurate?
3293780	3294780	It's not.
3294780	3300780	I mean, our stories can't be 100 million words long keys.
3300780	3302780	Could you call that?
3302780	3307780	David's obligation is not to include every single fact that you consider relevant.
3307780	3308780	Right.
3308780	3313780	But had you read that when, like, say he handed it into you and you read it, would you see
3313780	3316780	that as something relevant at the time?
3316780	3319780	But he didn't give you the option to see that as relevant yet.
3319780	3325780	So I'm not going to discuss what would be a draft or something that's not our final
3325780	3326780	published document.
3326780	3327780	Right.
3327780	3328780	Sorry.
3328780	3329780	Yeah, I don't mean that.
3329780	3335780	I just mean, like, if you saw a bigger picture, perhaps you would have a different view of
3335780	3338780	who this person is that David's writing about.
3338780	3343780	And just selectively telling the truth, half of the truth is close to, you know, I mean,
3343780	3348780	I tell Marie's seven-year-old that, you know, omitting a truth is the same thing as lying.
3348780	3350780	So lies of omission.
3350780	3355780	So I don't know if this considered the same thing in the eyes of the other time.
3355780	3360780	I would not agree that this is a lie of omission or misrepresentation by omission.
3360780	3361780	Okay.
3361780	3362780	Okay.
3362780	3363780	Okay.
3363780	3364780	So then let's move on to the next one.
3364780	3365780	So I was conflicted.
3365780	3366780	Sorry.
3366780	3367780	I wrote a lot about this.
3367780	3368780	Yes, blah, blah, blah.
3368780	3371780	But David knows all this stuff and he has it in his notes.
3371780	3375780	We've talked about it for a very long time over the course of five years.
3375780	3379780	So what makes a person crave the attention of journalists?
3379780	3381780	Consider where Val Brooksman comes from.
3381780	3385780	That sentence right there was another one that drove me mad.
3385780	3388780	So I want to make it clear.
3388780	3389780	And David knows this.
3389780	3392780	You can ask him and he'll, of course, you'll agree with me.
3392780	3395780	I have never approached a single journalist in my life.
3395780	3397780	Every journalist came to me.
3397780	3399780	Every single one.
3399780	3401780	I've never reached out to anyone.
3401780	3402780	I've never hunted a journalist.
3402780	3405780	I never said, uh, do you want to, how about this for a story?
3405780	3406780	Never.
3406780	3409780	Everyone's always come to me and I have liberally given everybody.
3409780	3413780	If I have, if I have information and data that helps them, I give it to them.
3413780	3414780	I've never said no.
3414780	3416780	And that's a huge problem.
3416780	3418780	I just don't know how to say no to people.
3418780	3424780	Uh, like I should have said no to David, I guess about a few things, but that is
3424780	3425780	another mischaracterization.
3425780	3429780	Just to say what makes a person crave the attention of journalists, obviously
3429780	3432780	equates to Val, craves the attention of journalists.
3432780	3433780	Right.
3433780	3436780	So, uh, that bothers me considerably so.
3436780	3442780	Um, and then he goes on to say that the reason, and I don't know, David doesn't
3442780	3444780	exactly, uh, have a, you know, he's a great guy.
3444780	3446780	He's a brilliant, brilliant guy.
3446780	3449780	He's such a good writer, but he's not like the guy that's going to probe the
3449780	3452780	depths of someone's psyche and come out with some answers.
3452780	3454780	He's not that type of person.
3454780	3458780	Um, so he decides to, uh, next thing he writes is about my childhood.
3458780	3461780	Which, you know, is, is a fucked up childhood.
3461780	3463780	I had one and he's pointing that out.
3463780	3468780	But why to, to equate my fucked up childhood to craving the attention of
3468780	3470780	journalists, that's a schism.
3470780	3473780	Um, it's a, it does not equate.
3473780	3478780	Um, you know, again, to me, but this is just how I felt when I saw it.
3478780	3481780	It was, uh, strange.
3481780	3485780	And he created something out of thin air that I crave the attention of
3485780	3486780	journalists.
3486780	3488780	He's again, telling and not showing.
3488780	3494780	And he doesn't, and he, when he just, uh, describes my background, uh,
3494780	3496780	now I'm just repeating myself next.
3496780	3497780	Sorry, but you get my point.
3497780	3498780	Right.
3498780	3499780	Do you understand?
3499780	3500780	Yeah.
3500780	3501780	I get your point.
3501780	3502780	Um, okay.
3502780	3503780	Cool.
3503780	3504780	So I can move on.
3504780	3505780	I do hear you.
3505780	3506780	Okay.
3506780	3507780	Thanks.
3507780	3508780	As long as you understand.
3508780	3509780	Um, yeah.
3509780	3510780	So six zero.
3510780	3511780	Okay.
3511780	3513780	So, uh, David leads, uh, sorry.
3513780	3514780	Uh, okay.
3514780	3515780	So we move on to this.
3515780	3516780	We're almost done.
3516780	3521780	Um, meanwhile, comma, Allah met and married Bill Brooksman, who was then an
3521780	3522780	up and coming banker.
3522780	3528780	Um, now to me, and I could be very wrong, but, uh, in the parlance of our
3528780	3533780	times, up and coming banker, uh, is a sort of, you have already association
3533780	3539780	with that, uh, term, uh, you have a sort of a, uh, a moneyed up, uh, young guy
3539780	3542780	that's trying to, is hungry and trying to make his start in the world.
3542780	3543780	Right.
3543780	3547780	Um, and I know that in the book, it'll be much more clear and I, and I trust
3547780	3548780	David on that.
3548780	3554780	But my father, uh, was not, he was one of six children living barely above
3554780	3558780	the poverty level in, in Illinois, son of a, literally son of a preacher
3558780	3561780	man and, um, did everything on his own.
3561780	3562780	So he wasn't this.
3562780	3566780	I'm looking this up in the, in the dictionary on my Mac and it says, up
3566780	3570780	and coming is defined as making good progress and likely to become successful.
3570780	3571780	Okay.
3571780	3572780	Yes.
3572780	3575780	Uh, but wouldn't you say it also has a connotation, a social connotation as
3575780	3576780	well?
3576780	3577780	Like a, uh,
3577780	3578780	I don't think so.
3578780	3579780	No.
3579780	3581780	I could, I could be wrong there, but I don't, up and coming just means
3581780	3584780	somebody on the rise as far as, as far as I, as far as I know.
3584780	3585780	Okay.
3585780	3587780	It could just, I could be totally wrong on this too.
3587780	3592780	I just, for some reason, I thought that it was like a class, a class system
3592780	3593780	sort of thing.
3593780	3594780	Sorry.
3594780	3596780	I just want to think about on the make or something like that.
3596780	3600780	There's a little more spin on that phrase, but on the make, on the make.
3600780	3601780	Oh, sorry.
3601780	3602780	Yeah.
3602780	3604780	I thought on the make just means trying to get laid.
3604780	3605780	Doesn't it?
3605780	3606780	That's what that means.
3606780	3607780	That's what it means in England.
3607780	3608780	Yeah.
3608780	3609780	If you're on the make, you're trying to get laid.
3609780	3610780	Running a scam or something.
3610780	3611780	Oh, okay.
3611780	3612780	Anyway.
3612780	3618780	So I think about that, that, that, that just means somebody who is on, who is
3618780	3621780	doing, doing whatever I just read to you in the dictionary.
3621780	3622780	I got you.
3622780	3623780	Okay.
3623780	3624780	That could be just, again, you're probably right.
3624780	3625780	Um, it's just the way I read it.
3625780	3629780	It made it seem like my mother, cause I wrote a whole thing like, oh, then my mother
3629780	3632780	must be this woman that's chasing a rich guy, which she was not.
3632780	3634780	She was also, they were both not.
3634780	3640780	No, no, I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't think that's, I didn't read it that way.
3640780	3641780	Yeah.
3641780	3642780	Okay.
3642780	3644780	That could, again, maybe just the way I read it.
3644780	3646780	Um, so we skip, skip forward.
3646780	3650780	Um, Bill adopted him in same paragraph 26.
3650780	3656780	Bill adopted him dash an angry, impulsive child, the strong anti-authority streak.
3656780	3663780	Um, I remember that was when David and I looked for the Cook County records, we saw this written
3663780	3669780	by a social, social worker, I think, um, someone that was in the system.
3669780	3675780	And, um, my thing on this is that I don't remember that at all.
3675780	3679780	Um, I don't know how true that is, but it's written by the social system.
3679780	3683780	I, I, um, that's it.
3684780	3686780	Um, that's it.
3686780	3687780	That's all I want to say about that.
3687780	3689780	I just don't remember that happening at all.
3689780	3694780	I don't know any, I cannot say that it did happen or it did not happen.
3694780	3696780	Um, paragraph 27.
3696780	3699780	Oh, this is where it, this is where it really stinks.
3699780	3703780	He wanted to be the center of attention to prove that he mattered.
3703780	3709780	So again, this is the redundant, a redundant kind of arbitrary attack on my character.
3709780	3711780	It doesn't help further the story.
3711780	3718780	It doesn't do anything, but it attacked me and solidified this terrible portrayal of this horrible person.
3718780	3720780	Uh, that is Val Brooksman now.
3720780	3728780	You know, it's careless ultimately and it brings no, it doesn't, it doesn't help the story move forward.
3728780	3733780	So like these, these sentences that are used could be used for something else, you know, adding to this.
3733780	3740780	I just don't understand and why he would be, and to be able to say like, this is David, I'm an authority to prove.
3740780	3743780	I'm an authority on what people think and believe, right?
3743780	3749780	So Val wants to be the center of attention and the reason why is to prove that he matters.
3749780	3755780	Now for paragraphs ago, he says Val wants to be the center of attention and he craves the attention of journalists.
3755780	3759780	And his explanation of that is because of my crazy, terrible childhood.
3759780	3761780	But now he changes it.
3761780	3764780	Now I want to be the center of attention to prove that I matter.
3764780	3765780	Like, do you see that?
3765780	3768780	It's very, it doesn't make sense.
3768780	3775780	Um, and then he says that that's part of the reason he'd be quote unquote, that's part of the reason he became a rocker.
3775780	3777780	It's less lonely with an audience.
3777780	3779780	He once told me, true.
3779780	3786780	I'd said that and it's on, uh, David and I recorded our fact checking for two days straight and it's on there and that's absolutely true.
3786780	3796780	Um, but it's used not to, uh, to, uh, what's, I don't know, I forgot the word amongst literary people,
3796780	3803780	but to color, to color a person's character or the story, it's used to show me again in a negative, pejorative light.
3803780	3805780	So, uh, it's, that's all I wanted to say.
3805780	3807780	It's, uh, sorry.
3807780	3811780	I thought we were going to focus on this call on the more technical stuff.
3811780	3812780	Yeah, sorry.
3812780	3813780	Sorry.
3813780	3814780	Sorry.
3814780	3816780	I just, uh, was going through the thing.
3816780	3817780	I'm skipping over a lot.
3817780	3821780	Um, uh, David the adjudicator, so he's, okay, sorry.
3822780	3827780	When his father died and Mr. Brooksman came into possession of his documents, I believe this is paragraph.
3827780	3829780	I got it here.
3829780	3830780	Oh, you got it? Okay.
3830780	3837780	When his father died and Mr. Brooksman came into possession of his documents, he finally had an opportunity to make the world pay attention.
3837780	3848780	Uh, again, it's, I mean, I guess this is part of the same thing, a very subjective thing to say, I know why Val does this without any proof, without any showing.
3848780	3850780	It's only telling, telling, telling.
3850780	3851780	And it's kind of disgusting.
3851780	3857780	I felt disgusted and like it's a careless judgment and it came to a head for me at the here in this, in the story.
3857780	3860780	I kind of lost my shit when I read this for the second time.
3860780	3865780	See, when my father died, I was so heartbroken for a very fucking long time.
3865780	3869780	I didn't see anything else but my father, but my father, that's it.
3869780	3879780	And I wanted to know why he killed himself and for David to paint me during this fucking terrible phase in my life is this horrible person to, man, sorry.
3879780	3883780	You know, it's not like I'm fucking crying.
3883780	3884780	It's ridiculous.
3884780	3885780	Hold on.
3885780	3886780	Sorry.
3886780	3887780	No, no, it's okay.
3887780	3888780	It's all.
3888780	3892780	It's, uh, you know, it's like, fuck.
3892780	3895780	It's hurtful.
3895780	3896780	Okay.
3896780	3897780	So.
3897780	3898780	Yeah.
3898780	3902780	Take your time.
3902780	3903780	Sorry.
3903780	3904780	Sorry.
3904780	3905780	Hold on.
3905780	3915780	So it's like, I can't talk, man.
3915780	3916780	Sorry.
3916780	3917780	I can't talk.
3917780	3918780	Okay.
3918780	3919780	It's like opportunistic.
3919780	3921780	I'm an opportunistic person.
3921780	3924780	You know, dude, I can't.
3924780	3925780	Fuck.
3925780	3926780	Just gather yourself.
3926780	3927780	It's fine.
3927780	3928780	Take your time.
3928780	3929780	All right.
3929780	3930780	It's all right.
3930780	3931780	Just one second.
3931780	3932780	Okay.
3932780	3933780	Okay.
3933780	3956780	Um, so it shows me as an opportunistic person using my father's death for my own selfish pursuits.
3956780	3962780	And that's hurtful, especially in this fucking New York Times.
3962780	3963780	Did you see that?
3963780	3970780	And see a friend, someone I thought was a friend, write that.
3970780	3971780	So fuck me.
3971780	3974780	I don't know if I can go further right now.
3974780	3977780	I mean, I got to call you back again.
3977780	3979780	Well, I'm sorry, man.
3979780	3980780	I need to head.
3980780	3982780	Look, I don't want to end this year.
3982780	3983780	I really don't want to end this year.
3983780	3985780	I need to head home shortly.
3985780	3986780	Yeah, I know.
3986780	3987780	I'm sorry, dude.
3987780	3989780	I'm sorry to throw all this on you.
3989780	3990780	This is terrible.
3990780	3991780	I'm very sorry.
3991780	3997780	Look, I, I, it's a difficult, I know it's difficult for you.
3997780	3998780	It's difficult to hear.
3998780	4000780	And I'm going to share all this with David.
4000780	4004780	I, you know, I'm, I really am sorry that this is hit you like this.
4004780	4011780	And, you know, I, I, I, please know that you are being heard here.
4011780	4014780	And I'm going to tell all this to David.
4014780	4015780	Okay.
4015780	4016780	Okay.
4016780	4017780	Yeah.
4017780	4018780	Thank you.
4018780	4019780	I mean, I'll, you know what?
4019780	4022780	I'll just write the rest and I'll send it to you and make it a little bit easier.
4022780	4023780	Nick.
4023780	4024780	Okay.
4024780	4027780	And then if you want some clarifications or anything, just give me a call.
4027780	4028780	Okay.
4028780	4029780	Okay.
4029780	4030780	Okay.
4030780	4031780	All right.
4031780	4032780	Thanks for listening to me.
4032780	4033780	Take care, Val.
4033780	4034780	Okay.
