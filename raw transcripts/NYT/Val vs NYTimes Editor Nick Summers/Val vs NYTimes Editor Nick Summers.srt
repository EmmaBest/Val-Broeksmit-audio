1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, Nick, can you hear me?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, hey, can you wait one second while I finish an email?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course, yeah.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, hi, Val, how are you?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey, Nick, I'm okay, how are you doing?

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Fine, I'm closing my section, it's a little busy, but let's talk.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, so I did what I told you I would do,

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and good grief, I spent about four hours doing this,

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and I was up very, very late, so I just bear with me for a moment

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and we get all this stuff together.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You cut out, I lost you after four hours.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah, sorry, yeah, it took me about four hours to do this,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and I went through the entire article, just sort of line for line,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and I made notes on the ones that I felt were either inaccurate mischaracterization

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
or just not true, or, and I don't know what,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and again, I don't want to come off like a guy that's complaining about,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
oh, I'm like, you know, you guys treated me badly,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that's not what I'm doing here.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Or maybe, again, like, maybe it is a little bit, but not 100%.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is an aggregate of issues here.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I just wanted to bring up one thing that you said yesterday before I start,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is that you told me, you said,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
when I asked you about the credit card fraud, and I said,

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
well, there's one, I'm not a credit card thief,

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and then you said, but aren't you, though?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then I thought about that, and he said, well, what do you mean?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He said, well, that's kind of the crux of your character here,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
is there someone that is an unreliable narrator,

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
down on, sorry, what was the thing you said?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Unreliable narrator or unreliable character,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but it's something that represents who I am.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And I said, well, that's based on just because one credit card,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
my mother's credit card is the only credit card I've ever used in my entire life.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And he said, yes, that does, that's accurate,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and that is the basis of your quote unquote character.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I thought about that, and I'm like, Nick,

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and he's already made up his mind about who I am,

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and I thought, wow, that's what the rest of the world is doing,

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
exactly what you're doing.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So based on this article, someone that does-

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think I would agree with that,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
that I've already made up my mind about who you are,

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and I'm not sure that that's exactly what I said.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But the comment to say, but Val, isn't that-

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
but aren't you though, right?

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The comment just because I was your instinct told you to say that.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We're saying that, yes.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, so your instinct, you had an impulse to say that.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You didn't think it through, you had an impulse and you said it first,

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
because that is what you believe of me,

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
because the way you've already assembled who I am as a person in your head

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
is pretty much this person that David has described,

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and that is the problem I'm having.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The rest of the world is going to do the same thing,

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and that's a huge issue for me.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because you don't know me, and it's not me,

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and I can tell you that over and over again,

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but it's already too late, you've already decided in a sense.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But of course, with different variations, you can change your mind,

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but you have a pretty core sense of who you think I am.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And this is a problem, and that's why I want to go over all this stuff with you.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, Val, with respect to that, I mean,

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have to have a sense of who you are,

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
but it's not because of one detail in a story.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's because I've talked with David extensively about this,

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and we've gone through many drafts, which discussed this story.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I've read up in other ways.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, you know, we only spoke in this is the second time we've ever spoken.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I know some things about you, some things I don't,

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but I think you might be a little fixated on that one detail

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and a pretty long piece that goes into some depth.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't think I would agree with you that it's...

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But it's just an example.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's just an example, Nick.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm just giving you one example of many,

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and that was just one thing that sure showed me

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
how people make up their minds on people very quickly,

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and this is the issue I'm having with the article.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's it. I don't put it all on you saying,

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
this is what you believe. I'm not saying that.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But I do understand where you're coming from.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I wanted to tell you that it's neither right or wrong

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
just to keep an open mind.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Really, you know?

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, cool.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So let me start with David didn't fact check with me.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I asked him, are we going to do a fact check

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
about I think this was Sunday or Friday, maybe Saturday,

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
sometime in the weekend before you publish?

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And so we've already done the fact check.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I said, what are you talking about?

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So we did the fact check when I was here in 2015,

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
sorry, in 2019, January.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I said, well, David, that doesn't count.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's pretty much exactly the same as the story

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
we went over in January 2019.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So that's part of the problem.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Had we done a proper fact check,

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I would have told him about that $1,000 versus $5,000 thing.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And many of these other issues.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm still waiting for you to point out the fact

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that's wrong in the story.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
As far as you're aware, yes.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So I'm going to change your awareness.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ready?

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Number paragraph one, an unemployed rock musician

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
with the history of abuse and credit card theft.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Again, this is where we're going back over the same shit,

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
but this is the same thing.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Unemployed rock musician is inaccurate.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I am a musician.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am employed.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have a company called Bikini Robot Army Productions.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I am self-employed.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I make money from royalties monthly.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You know what a royalty is, I'm sure.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's part a is inaccurate history of abuse.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Of course, that's I'm not contesting that.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But credit card theft, again, is misleading and mischaracterization.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And in my head, one credit card stolen from my mother is not,

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
does not equate to credit card history of credit card theft.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Technically, yeah, of course, it's just like saying, you know,

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
whatever, I can give you a bunch of ridiculous examples,

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
but you know what my point is.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And there's no point in going over the whole thing again.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I just want to make that clear.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And is that okay?

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You got, can you hear me?

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can hear you.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You just said a lot of things.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm actually not sure which particular thing you're asking me to respond to.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, whatever.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, I guess the number one, I am employed.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I have my own company, Bikini Robot Army Productions,

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and I am paid with royalties.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Royalty checks monthly from one to two different tune core.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And what's the other one?

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't remember the name of the distributor,

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
but there's two different distributors that pay me.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So that is, I guess, technically not factual.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And again, I guess you want to start with that?

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sorry.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Sorry, I talk over.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm so sorry.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Just tell me to shut up if I start talking too much.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
No, no, no, no, no, this is fine.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, let's try to be organized about this.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So that's, I mean, if you, if you're disputing whether you were,

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
yeah, the time of this meeting in a lead unemployed or not,

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
that is something factual that we can look at.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The best way to raise these factual points is an email to me.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I mean, the only thing is it's 508 on a Friday,

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
East Coast time right now.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So this piece has already been online for,

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
oh no.

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is the fourth day, and it's going to print press

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
very, very, very shortly.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I know that's why I want to talk to you so quickly.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's why I'm, yeah.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to hear absolutely every,

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
every objection you're making in terms of the factual accuracy

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
of the piece.

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's, but do you see Nick?

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What I'm saying about is whether it's,

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sorry.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fortunately, the best way to do this is on email.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You know, you can be very, very clear,

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but we're also running out of time.

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I know that's a problem.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's a problem.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But that's why if we can, if you sit down,

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
if you give me like 30 minutes,

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll go through all of it and then I'll leave it to you.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I won't argue with you.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll just say this is, I'll leave it in your hands.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You know?

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay.

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Right now you're saying you were unemployed.

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You were self-employed.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You had a company.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And you were royalty checks.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you hearing that roughly, correctly?

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's exactly it.

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But it's not had a company, have a company, still do.

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, we're talking about a line and a piece where this is action

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
taking place in what you're earlier, earlier this year.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's not that far away.

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's good.

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let me make a note of this.

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You know, anything you say, I'm going to check with David,

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
we're going to check independently.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sure.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And make sure that our piece is totally accurate.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Of course.

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's move on to the next one.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Point number two was the credit card theft with a history of credit card theft.

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
A history of open abuse and failure.

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, you have a history of credit card theft.

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't, you're not going to get any satisfaction here.

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm just telling you that's the one thing.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You have a credit card and it's not, I know that's how you don't want to,

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
you don't want to look at it that way.

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I got you.

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I just want to make it known and make it clear.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And it just, unfortunately, there's no way to non-pluralize credit card theft.

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Sorry.

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It could sound, it's a plural statement, you know, no matter how you look at it.

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You know, so that's a problem.

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The American, with the English language, I guess.

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But anyway, that's number two.

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Number three, where my Deutsche Bank, I felt that, where Bill B,

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
sorry, look at my notes, paragraph three.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So it's, I just wrote down extremely reductive way of describing my father's role within

228
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the bank.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He was a chief risk optimization officer.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
David writes that my dad was a, David writes, they talked Deutsche Bank.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are we talking about the third paragraph of the story here?

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They wanted to talk about Deutsche Bank, one of the world's largest, most troubled

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
financial institutions.

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Third paragraph?

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah.

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm reading it.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Since late father, Bill had been a senior executive there, and his son possessed the

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
cash of confidentiality.

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So I wrote that this was a way, too reductive, that my father's role was other than a,

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
instead of saying a senior.

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I want to hear, I want to hear anything in a way, which I started with an anchor, but

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
if not, you're going to edit our story that's online.

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not trying to.

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Again, again, Nick.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I need to be very clear with you.

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah.

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Nick, I'm not, I'm not trying to.

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Given how short time is.

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, sorry.

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Given how short time is, I'll be very straight.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I want to know everything that might be faxed along with the story, but this piece has

256
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
been up for so long, even if it's only been up for one minute, you will not edit the story.

257
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I know.

258
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There's no point at which you say that, you know, if we say, if we said that a, that a

259
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
pizza was warm and you prefer us to say that pizza was hot.

260
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I know.

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I know.

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I know.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Dude, you got me, dude, you got me pegged wrong.

264
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not at all trying to do that.

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm just wanting to say that my father was a chief risk optimization officer.

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's his title.

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That is a senior executive.

268
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

269
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So that's accurate.

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's it.

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Fine.

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's all I'm trying to say.

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you know, I'm not, I don't want to argue that with you.

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's, I just thought that was a, an issue.

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay.

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Paragraph four.

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
One, two, three, four.

279
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sorry.

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Trump and DB.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's, I never mind.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No.

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Number five, David introduces the FBI agents without explaining the direct quotes.

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So my, my problem here is that, uh, I guess David told you how we got these direct quotes,

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
right?

286
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I would rather not talk about the particulars of any of that.

287
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Uh, well, that's, it's an issue for me because, uh, I guess I don't know if people, if someone

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:17,000
has a proper, you know, uh, what's the word, uh, uh, deductive reasoning, they can say,

289
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
well, how is David possibly quoting, uh, the FBI agents?

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He wasn't there.

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Um, and Val, maybe did he take notes or was it recorded?

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Right.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So clearly.

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
A reader might wonder why there is verbatim dialogue from a, from a closed room.

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Precisely.

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that, that's a problem for me that could, uh, put me in, get me in trouble.

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Uh, sorry.

298
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let me, somebody keeps calling.

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Uh, uh, hello.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Can you hear me?

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hi.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, sorry.

303
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Uh, and, and he said, hello.

304
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hello, Nick.

305
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Can you hear me?

306
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh no.

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Nick.

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Nick.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Nick.

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sorry.

311
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can you hear me?

312
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Uh, give me one second.

313
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I, I, I gotta put you back on.

314
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
One second, Nick.

316
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Hold on.

317
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I gotta fix this.

318
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I put you back on, uh, the speaker so I can, can you hear me now?

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Nick.

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Now I can hear you much worse.

321
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

322
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Uh, is this any better now?

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hello.

324
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah.

325
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's good.

326
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, perfect.

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Good.

328
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay.

329
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Uh, so, so that was an issue for me that could get me into a lot of trouble.

330
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know if I have anything, any say that.

331
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Is there any way around that?

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Uh, I don't know.

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I just wanted to let you know that that was kind of an issue for me.

334
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's it.

335
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So my understanding is that we were a bit awkward or something.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't want to discuss.

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I know.

338
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I know.

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's tricky.

340
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
David's sourcing on a call.

341
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I assume you're recording this and I don't want to say anything that, you know, you understand

342
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
how closely journalists keep their sources of information and I don't.

343
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I am the source, but I'm telling you, I am the source so you don't have to hide.

344
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I mean, everyone knows it's me.

345
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm the source, but I am afraid that that is people keep texting.

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But I'm afraid you want to, if you gave this dialogue to David, did David not have permission

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to use it?

349
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No, I gave him permission to use.

350
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, wait.

351
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What is your objection here?

352
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No, my objection is, uh, is there a way to disguise with and still tell the truth?

353
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Uh, this my sourcing that I'm the source of this one.

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay.

355
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not going to edit it because of your, you know, just things you would prefer.

356
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Second, just candidly.

357
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

358
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Uh, if we think to change, it would bring so much more attention to that.

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Right.

360
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Right.

361
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Right.

362
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
With that thing, the Streisand effect.

363
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Right.

364
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay.

365
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You draw attention to what you hope not to.

366
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah.

367
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Uh, people look for changes to New York Times copy.

368
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Um, I got you.

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's really moving.

370
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm not going to be editing this piece because of a preference that you have.

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay.

372
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Again, didn't have to say that, but I get it.

373
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Um, I get it.

374
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
All right.

375
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It makes sense.

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
All right.

377
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Um, and I didn't think about that until you just said it and that actually makes perfect

378
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
sense.

379
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
All right.

380
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Um, let's see.

381
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
For five years.

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Okay.

383
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So this one's where it sort of starts becoming more subjective and offensive.

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So for five, for more than five years, Val Brooksman, this is paragraph.

385
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Sorry.

386
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Uh, I got it.

387
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I guess like numbers five or six.

388
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The quote is for more than five years, Val Brooksman has been dangling his Deutsche Bank

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
files in front of journalists and government investigators.

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Quote, dreaming on becoming the next great American whistleblower.

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I've never said anything.

392
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I've never said that to any human being in my entire life that I've never even crossed

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
my mind to become the next great American whistleblower.

394
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That is very, very strange thing that David would write.

395
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's very, I don't know what to say.

396
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's just like the beginning of, uh, of this sort of painting, uh, the terrible picture

397
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
of me.

398
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Um, so I take great umbrage with that.

399
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Um, number two, you want, uh, Val quote unquote, dot, dot, dot.

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Val wants to expose what he sees as corporate wrongdoing, give, give some meaning to his

401
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
father's death, dash, and maybe get famous along the way.

402
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Okay.

403
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm still like shivering with anger when I read that now.

404
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Number one, I never wanted to expose any corporate wrongdoings.

405
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That was not my goal.

406
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
All I wanted to do was solve the mystery of my father's death.

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's it.

408
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I had one goal.

409
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There was no like, let's expose Deutsche Bank and drop JP.

410
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, none of that shit.

411
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I didn't care about that shit.

412
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
All I want to know is why the fuck did my dad kill himself?

413
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's it.

414
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
All right.

415
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
My intention was to solve this, this, this murder that I thought, you know, at that time,

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I thought he was murdered.

417
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So it really is.

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And that, and that last sentence, get famous along the way is so infuriating.

419
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I never, anyone that knows me never will never say that wants to be famous.

420
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm like, this, this famous thing is, is really, uh, if anything, the projections of David putting

421
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it onto me, if anything, I mean, I can't believe that he would say something so ridiculous.

422
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And absurd.

423
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Um, and I'm sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm, yeah, sorry, I'm, I'm angry.

424
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Sorry.

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

426
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You know, these are, this is legitimate complaint.

427
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think, you know, we should, you should write a letter to the editor.

428
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You should, you should say that you, that you can do this.

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Um, sorry.

430
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm just getting that.

431
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I get angry.

432
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Sorry.

433
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can, you can take to Twitter and say that you, you know, you disagree.

434
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah.

435
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Strongly with this characterization.

436
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Um, you know, and I think, um, yeah.

437
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's certainly, you know, you, you have options that you're at your disposal and disregard.

438
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay.

439
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And so I'm just bringing that up to you.

440
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And so I did not know I had options and, uh, I'm, I do know obviously Twitter is an option.

441
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I just didn't know I had a, you're not the editors.

442
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If I write a letter to the other, which I would love to do, can I give that to you?

443
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Is there a way to jump this queue a little bit?

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a single inbox.

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's just, uh, letter to the editor is just, you're pretty sophisticated media consumer

446
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
about it.

447
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm surprised that you're not familiar with that letter to the editor.

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

449
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I've never done it.

450
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So I've never done it before.

451
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a large address that anybody can email.

452
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is there a way to jump the queue?

453
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm asking since the story just came out and, you know, if it's like a five months later,

454
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
no one's going to care.

455
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Whoever, whoever edits that, that, that thing, the space where we run letters to the editor,

456
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
they read every, every note, there's, you know, they, they're, they're pretty, they're

457
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
pretty good.

458
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sure.

459
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Um, so I wouldn't worry about being down, down in a queue or something.

460
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay.

461
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Then I'll give that a go.

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Um,

463
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Letters at NY times.com.

464
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Uh, let me just get a pen.

465
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, I can remember that.

466
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Letters at NY times.com.

467
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's easy.

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If you Google it, it comes up immediately.

469
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

470
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
All right.

471
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Perfect.

472
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Um, uh, okay.

473
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So I got through that one.

474
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Um, I pulled, okay.

475
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Uh, and maybe get famous along the way.

476
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I got that.

477
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I pulled them more than anyone.

478
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So David says, um, uh, in gosh, was that paragraph seven?

479
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Uh, we've got your holding documents.

480
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Should David says, basically, he said, quote unquote, he pulled, I pulled them more than

481
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
anyone saying he pulled my strings more than anyone.

482
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Um, and I just had took a problem with that.

483
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So what I wrote here was an egotistical sentence, self-elevating and highly condescending words.

484
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Again, showing David's inner workings more than mine.

485
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Um, just this, this, this is the characterization of me is getting more and more, uh, uh, reductive

486
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to, uh, a point of a cliche now.

487
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And paragraph eight, he, uh, talks about my drug use and he says between manias and stupors.

488
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And I completely inaccurate.

489
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I challenged David to show me one mania and one stupor.

490
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Once when he, I've spoken with him.

491
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I, I don't know where that comes from.

492
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It infers that I have this sort of, uh, uh, this bipolar ish mood swing person, which I am not and never have been.

493
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And that is sort of another mischaracterization.

494
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Um, it's sort of a, you know, okay.

495
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The quote, he has a maddening, same paragraph.

496
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There's a maddening habit of leaping to outrageous conclusions and then bending facts to fit Farfetch theories.

497
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He fantasizes about seeing his story told by Hollywood.

498
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And I sometimes wonder whether he's manipulating me to achieve that ambition.

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He can be impatient, erratic and abusive.

500
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's mostly right.

501
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes.

502
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Of course I can be impatient, erratic, abusive.

503
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I do bend facts to fit Farfetch theories.

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Um, but fantasizing about seeing my story in Hollywood.

505
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sort of, uh, this works only to, uh, cement this fame seeking person that he started a few paragraphs ago.

506
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And that is the one that really bothers me.

507
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Um, uh, it's, it's, it's misleading.

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's a self grandiose intention.

509
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's full, it's full.

510
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's, there's something I can't quite put my finger on it.

511
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know how to describe it, but it's, look, okay, Nick, when David came to see me before there was a book,

512
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
before there was, uh, the New York Times okayed the article the first time around a year ago.

513
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Uh, David came to visit me in Los Angeles and he, uh, said,

514
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
we're talking about my story and says this would be a perfect film.

515
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This would be a great idea for a Netflix series.

516
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I said, yeah, of course.

517
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So he signed, he gave me a book of his, the library book, a hard copy because I requested one.

518
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And he signed it for me and he wrote, um, uh, where is he, I wrote it somewhere.

519
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let me get it to my little library.

520
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He wrote to me just to show you that this whole Hollywood thing is not me.

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Val, enjoy the book.

522
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can't wait to tell your story and all the cinematic glory that it deserves.

523
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This is during our conversation.

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's, I have it inscribed in the book that he gave me.

525
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay.

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So he's been pushing this Hollywood thing way before.

527
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You did not have any Hollywood dreams and there's more David's Hollywood dreams than, than yours.

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm saying, I, everyone has Hollywood dreams, but I'm saying mine are no, uh, no greater or less than anyone else's.

529
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's it.

530
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Um, and it's not something that needs to be, uh, pushed.

531
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
All races with, with David want, you know, my understanding from him is that one of the reasons you had moved out west was to, I think as we say in the story,

532
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
turn up Hollywood interest in your story.

533
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yeah.

534
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I, I, I, you know.

535
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's fine.

536
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's perfect.

537
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I know that's perfectly okay.

538
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That sentence was okay.

539
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Cause that is true, but the characterization, because the characterization

540
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
may be getting famous along the way.

541
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

542
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But that's, that's the way that's, you know, of course everyone was like, Oh, well, life will be like if you're famous, et cetera.

543
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
This is a common, uh, notion amongst every, every human being basically, but, but the character.

544
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I understand.

545
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Are you saying that it is accurate?

546
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No.

547
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No.

548
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
One of the reasons you moved to LA was to turn up Hollywood interest in your story, but you were not interested in getting famous.

549
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No, that's, of course, of course, no, of course in fame comes along with that.

550
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No, that's not what I'm saying.

551
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm saying that is accurate, but the characterization and the repetitive nature of saying this guy wants, all he wants to be is famous.

552
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That is a pejorative that is, uh, constantly, it's a theme in this, uh, article.

553
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I mean, it's, it's, it's almost every third paragraph.

554
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
There's something about Val's trying to push his own agenda of being famous.

555
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I mean, it's like, what the hell?

556
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm not this, this is disturbing.

557
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's, it disturbs me.

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

559
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And I just want to point that out that it's like to dwell on that over and over again is really, it gets sticks in the back of someone's head and say, Oh, this is one of those fame seeking assholes, you know, which I am not.

560
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Um, you can, uh,

561
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Before we move on, you know, you raise this line.

562
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Um,

563
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Um,

564
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Where is it?

565
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Um,

566
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Um,

567
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
How raiders conclusions, bending facts.

568
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Um,

569
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah.

570
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You know,

571
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There's also this thing about, uh, a brokerage account.

572
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Um,

573
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yes.

574
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So if I look at your Twitter page right now, am I going to see a screenshot that is that you claim is,

575
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Oh, that's a joke.

576
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes.

577
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Because David wrote, he knows it's a joke.

578
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I mean,

579
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You know,

580
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah.

581
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I think David's concern is that, uh,

582
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Very few people will think that it is a joke and that, um,

583
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Well,

584
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He certainly didn't take it as a joke when you were originally telling him about it.

585
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Uh, he thought that you were being serious.

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I mean, he, he, he thought what we described in the story.

587
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, I couldn't believe that.

588
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That was, that was astonishing to me that David thought that I actually had done that.

589
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But, you know,

590
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Whatever.

591
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
What can I do?

592
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And in this,

593
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And if you read this article,

594
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I think anyone that has

595
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Is your,

596
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Is your tweet still up the one saying David is insider trading on all this stuff?

597
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah.

598
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But that is pretty,

599
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah.

600
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm going to be honest.

601
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's pretty shitty, Val.

602
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What?

603
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But David said it was hilarious.

604
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He tweeted to me.

605
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Hilarious.

606
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He thought it was funny.

607
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Did he really?

608
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yes.

609
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
As soon as I put it up,

610
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I have it right here.

611
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hilarious.

612
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I've got it there.

613
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Is he being sarcastic?

614
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
No.

615
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He's being sarcastic.

616
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Because it is funny.

617
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because in them,

618
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And the first thing you read about is Val tried to set me up in this thing.

619
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And that's kind of a funny story.

620
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's a funny incident.

621
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I get it.

622
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So then I put a fake,

623
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
A thing.

624
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So here,

625
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Here's David's thing with a smiley face.

626
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's,

627
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's like jokie.

628
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's funny.

629
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's why he said,

630
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I have it.

631
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll show you the screenshot.

632
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Whatever you need.

633
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It says hilarious.

634
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
All right.

635
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Well, yeah.

636
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I mean,

637
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
If he's texting you that it's hilarious.

638
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And he,

639
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He's been emailing me saying that he's concerned that people won't think that you're kidding.

640
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Because Louis freaking meant,

641
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I didn't realize he had texted you something that was hilarious.

642
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah.

643
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I would kind of guess that he was being sarcastic.

644
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah.

645
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know,

646
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Don't pull my leg like this.

647
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But,

648
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
No, no, no, no.

649
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's really for you guys to,

650
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
To work out.

651
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

652
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You just want to say that I consider it shitty.

653
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And,

654
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You think that's shitty.

655
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You're concerned about people believing you and,

656
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And thinking highly of you.

657
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's,

658
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Okay, Nick.

659
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Nick.

660
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I get it.

661
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I get it.

662
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I get the opposite.

663
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Thank you, Nick.

664
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You should be doing.

665
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I thank you for your ethical standpoint and showing me what that is.

666
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But if you think it's a matter of taste of humor,

667
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And David got it right away.

668
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And I think a lot of other people did.

669
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm happy to put up another statement saying this is obviously a joke.

670
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If someone,

671
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Whoever takes this seriously clearly did not read the article.

672
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That's up to you.

673
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm not going to add it.

674
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm happy to.

675
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm not going to add it.

676
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You're twisting your feed.

677
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

678
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You're not going to add it.

679
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
My story.

680
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Next point.

681
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay.

682
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Thank you.

683
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So we got,

684
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Shit, where are we?

685
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Okay.

686
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Unaccountable.

687
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Uh,

688
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Little bit.

689
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay.

690
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So the whole thing that this incident,

691
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
What is funny in the story.

692
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I,

693
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm not,

694
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I have a matter with it and I don't have an issue with it other than David,

695
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It takes it out of context and makes me look like a person that is,

696
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Uh,

697
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Just kind of a crazy person that is setting up these things.

698
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The same things to the brokerage again.

699
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes, the brokerage account thing.

700
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
David, I have a whole text message conversation between us.

701
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,280
It explains it all, but basically.

702
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
No, he didn't take it as a joke.

703
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I mean, he, like.

704
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,440
No, I know, I know.

705
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,600
He left his, like, employer at the publisher now, like.

706
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,440
Yeah.

707
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,760
He did not take it as a joke.

708
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,600
I know that now.

709
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,120
What happened in the story is exactly how it played out.

710
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,480
I know it is, and that's not what I'm saying, Nick.

711
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,640
What I'm saying is he took,

712
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,960
what he took out of context was the reason why I did it.

713
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,800
He just showed something that happened

714
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,480
without explaining why.

715
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
And that's what bothers me.

716
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,840
Makes me look like a crazy person

717
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,440
when you take something out of context.

718
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,360
He took a truth, and it did happen exactly as he said it did.

719
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,320
Perfectly recounted.

720
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,480
What was the context?

721
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,280
The context was.

722
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,280
After 20 months of sort of being a donkey looking,

723
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,880
staring at a carrot, waiting for this thing to be,

724
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,160
this article is supposed to be published a long time ago,

725
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,320
a year and a half ago.

726
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,840
The book was originally called The Banker's Son.

727
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,960
And then I was slowly removed from my own story in my head.

728
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,560
And I didn't know what was going on.

729
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
I didn't know who to believe.

730
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,400
But suddenly The Banker's Son became the Dark Towers.

731
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000
And I was in the subtext.

732
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,720
The sub, you know, it says like Dark Towers,

733
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

734
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
whatever that secondary line is called.

735
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,440
I was in there, and then I got removed from that.

736
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,640
Then there were pictures of me

737
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,720
that were supposed to be in the book.

738
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,000
Pictures of myself, my father, they got removed.

739
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,840
And then there was the-

740
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,160
So you sent the brokerage-

741
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,000
Hold on, I'm not-

742
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,840
I'm not-

743
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Because you're upset about being written out of the story?

744
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,000
No, I'm not there.

745
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,840
I'm not quite,

746
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,400
let me finish and I'll tell you and you'll see.

747
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,240
Sorry.

748
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,760
So over systematically over a series of a year and a half,

749
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,480
David, the agreement we had was that this is a book

750
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,640
about my story and my father's story.

751
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,280
Slowly I'm being removed from my own story.

752
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,200
And David is saying, oh, don't worry about it.

753
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,600
It's all fine, you're in the story.

754
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,320
So if you can imagine the pressure or the feeling

755
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,080
of being lied to or being betrayed every few months

756
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,640
when something is taken from you.

757
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,760
So then the pictures are going.

758
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
And the blurb, David says, don't worry about it.

759
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm gonna change the blurb.

760
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,640
I'm gonna make your father and you more prominent.

761
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,480
He writes me what the blurb is going to be,

762
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,920
writes it out completely.

763
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,980
And he publishes the blurb, okay,

764
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,240
exactly how he sent it to me with one thing missing

765
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,880
and that was my name.

766
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,280
And I said, David, I sent him a text and David,

767
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,160
what the hell's going on?

768
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,000
WTF?

769
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,960
Well, what is this blurb?

770
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,120
You said it was gonna be like you said.

771
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,960
And then he said, the thing that set me off was,

772
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,920
let me show you the text.

773
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,760
Let me just get the text.

774
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
It was, sorry, word for word.

775
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,960
I have to put you on hold for a second,

776
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,800
but I'll try not to.

777
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,400
The word for word, it was something like,

778
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,600
we found that your name added no value to the story.

779
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,000
That was what he said that morning

780
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,880
before I did the brokerage thing.

781
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,480
And that just was the straw that broke

782
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,560
the camel's back.

783
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,240
My name brings no value to the story.

784
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,520
It's my own story, right?

785
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,400
So I flipped out and I was the only one awake.

786
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Let me say something.

787
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,880
Your story says is, a few days ago,

788
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,520
I read that he was not named from the blurb

789
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,280
for my book on Amazon, among other perceived slides.

790
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,720
He sent me a string of text claiming

791
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,360
that the brokerage stuff.

792
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,320
That seems like an extremely accurate

793
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,640
and concise description of the context

794
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,800
that you just told me was missing.

795
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,920
Wrong, other conceived slides is the problem.

796
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,400
That's what's missing, the actual other conceived slides.

797
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,040
Otherwise, it looks like I'm a ridiculous person.

798
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
And David knows that I'm not.

799
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,560
So this is, in a sense, everyone starts like,

800
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,400
is this guy hate you?

801
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,880
Is this a vengeful act that he's done?

802
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
I don't know if it is because of this incident.

803
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,720
I don't know.

804
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,000
But I'm telling you, when you say other perceived slides.

805
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,840
I'm not sure what you want.

806
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,800
You seem to want to have written this story.

807
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,800
No, come on, man.

808
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,680
No, I don't want to write this story.

809
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't want to write this story.

810
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,920
I just want to not be characterized as an asshole.

811
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,200
That's how I'm looked at, like a real dickhead,

812
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,520
like a real person that you don't ever want to talk

813
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,160
like a nasty fuckhead that I, people, I say,

814
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,240
oh my God, that's someone you stay away from.

815
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,600
I would tell my girlfriend's kid

816
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,040
to stay away from this type of person.

817
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,240
Do you understand this?

818
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,400
And you say, well, maybe you are that type of person, right?

819
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,000
Is what your people tend to think.

820
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,720
Well, it's in the New York Times.

821
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
So you must be that type of person.

822
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,000
And that is the problem, Nick.

823
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,520
That's what I would like change.

824
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Is that my characterization of me by these descriptors

825
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,480
that David puts in here, there's not,

826
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,800
there's only one non-pejorative.

827
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,640
I need to reiterate it again.

828
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,880
I'm not going to edit this piece.

829
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,320
I know, that's, again, you ask me a question.

830
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,360
Is it the way you want to be?

831
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,200
You ask me a question.

832
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,280
You just want to be described in character.

833
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,600
Nick, you ask me a question.

834
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,720
I'm answering it, man.

835
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,040
I know that you're not going to edit the way I want.

836
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,480
I know it, and I'm not trying to get you to, okay?

837
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,960
Can we leave that alone for now?

838
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,280
I mean, you've said it like 50 times.

839
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,600
I'm telling you, I'm not trying to do that.

840
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm bringing up the issues I have.

841
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,040
That's it.

842
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,680
You asked me to, and I did it for you.

843
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,320
I spent four hours doing this last night, okay?

844
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,160
So we can agree to that, please.

845
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm not trying to do anything else.

846
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,360
So it's the characterization of me,

847
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,440
and this is another one.

848
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,240
There's one, other than the very last sentence

849
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
of the story, there is one line where he says

850
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,560
that I'm fearless.

851
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,400
That's it.

852
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,240
I need to know what you want here.

853
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,640
What are you, do you want to be heard?

854
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,480
Do you want to hear?

855
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,560
Yeah, I don't really know, Nick.

856
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,880
I don't know, I really don't know.

857
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,480
Maybe the changes to the story would be great,

858
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,000
but I doubt you're not going to do that, so I understand.

859
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
Maybe I want to be heard, I don't know.

860
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,320
I don't know, I just know that something is wrong,

861
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
and I just want to fix the thing that is wrong.

862
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,960
And then, David said, talk to Nick Summers.

863
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,440
So here I am talking to you, all right?

864
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,800
That's it, I don't know.

865
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,880
So this, I can't, I mean, I don't know.

866
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,840
Anyway, there's one kind thing that David said,

867
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,360
called me fearless, right?

868
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,840
And that is the one nice thing he says in the entire book.

869
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,000
So this guy's been my friend.

870
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,520
I thought this guy was my friend for five years,

871
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,560
and this is what I see.

872
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,840
So you can imagine my surprise, all right?

873
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,800
This is not something that a friend would write

874
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,800
about someone that you like, or else it is.

875
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,200
I don't know, he's trying to be fair,

876
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,240
and he overcompensated on the negativity.

877
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
Perhaps that's the thing.

878
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,080
I don't know what it is,

879
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,920
he doesn't really answer that question.

880
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,080
But the whole, the entire thing is, is why, sorry,

881
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,800
now I'm sort of stuttering now,

882
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,360
because I don't know, because I'm kind of upset,

883
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,840
but sorry, let me just take a breath, Homer.

884
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
I feel like it's a pejorative account of me.

885
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Anyone that would read this would think

886
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,160
that this is not a good person, okay?

887
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,360
There is no love, there's no love for my father.

888
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,120
There's no love for the reason why I set upon this journey.

889
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,720
There's no prime mover or an event that shows

890
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,920
that why I did all this stuff.

891
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,200
There's no love from David.

892
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
There's no love from me to my father.

893
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,800
There's no thing that has a kindness or shows heart and soul.

894
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,280
No heart and soul, it's just negative descriptors

895
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,120
and pejoratives.

896
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,080
Of course, of course I have.

897
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,840
And he says, I don't agree with,

898
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,720
I said, he says, I understand your point of view,

899
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
but I don't agree with your perception.

900
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,360
That's what he says.

901
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,520
I'm like, what the fuck?

902
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
That's it, that's it.

903
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,280
I'll send you all the freaking screenshots

904
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,240
from all our conversations, if you like.

905
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,120
I'll show you, it paints a real clear picture,

906
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,840
but I might end up just doing that on Twitter.

907
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,440
I mean, I don't know, man, I'm just really upset about it.

908
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,000
It just keeps going on.

909
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,920
I'm almost, and then we go.

910
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,560
I'm sorry, and I do mean it, I don't mean any,

911
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,520
I can dismiss it, but I'm sorry that this is the,

912
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,080
that when you read this, you felt,

913
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,680
you've come this characterizing, you felt

914
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,280
that there was no love of it.

915
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,720
Dude, I was hurt, I was actually hurt.

916
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,800
That the one you guys had was not,

917
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,320
you know, that it came out of David's pen

918
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,720
different than you've been living it.

919
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,840
I am sorry for that.

920
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,680
Thank you.

921
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,400
And, you know.

922
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,240
Thank you.

923
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,760
I might have an unsatisfying answer, you know.

924
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,800
Yeah, I know, I know.

925
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I felt, it's hurt.

926
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,520
This is David's story to write, this is how he wrote it,

927
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,600
and I get it.

928
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,600
In terms of like, in terms of the balance of love

929
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,320
or anything else,

930
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,120
I'm frankly, I'm just not sure what,

931
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,280
totally what the sides.

932
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,120
Well, you're the editor.

933
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,360
That's why I thought, you know, you would find the balance.

934
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
So Nick, the story comes to you.

935
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,680
I get it, I'm not a journalist,

936
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,800
but I would guess that the story gets to you,

937
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,560
and you're like, well, I like this, I don't like this.

938
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,880
Where's the balance?

939
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,680
So maybe that's why I'm talking to you.

940
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,720
And maybe that's why David gave me to you

941
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,760
subconsciously, perhaps said, well, Nick's can be.

942
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,080
Yeah, that's what others do, but you know,

943
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,880
look, there's no way for, you know.

944
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,720
Yeah.

945
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
David, if the story that we work on together,

946
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,320
I can't, one thing that I said,

947
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
I can't factor, I guess,

948
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,120
is the amount of love between you and David.

949
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,360
That's something that I,

950
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,680
as you can see, that's what I'm talking about.

951
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,240
Yeah, I know, again, I don't know why you say that,

952
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,080
because obviously that's, I'm not asking you to do that.

953
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,360
That's a strange thing to say,

954
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,680
but it's the love, there's no balance.

955
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,640
It's all negativity of who I am, negativity.

956
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,600
That's it.

957
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,760
It's about, I'm not painted equally.

958
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,000
This is, again, more into like,

959
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,520
the sort of thing you can put in,

960
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,760
and I'll let her see the editor,

961
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,640
or frankly, more people will read

962
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,760
what you have to say about this

963
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,040
if you put it on Twitter than I'll let her see the editor.

964
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,640
So the editor has all kinds of work,

965
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,400
count limits, and it's got to be formal,

966
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,560
you know, on Twitter, you can do whatever you want.

967
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,840
Okay.

968
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,680
You are, you're pretty sophisticated.

969
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Person who interacts with many different parts

970
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,360
of the news media,

971
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,360
and you have ways of getting your story out.

972
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,320
I know, but I don't want to do that, man.

973
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,360
I like the New York Times.

974
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,080
You guys are my favorite painter,

975
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,200
painter, sorry, my favorite newspaper.

976
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,680
And David, I always thought was a talented writer, you know,

977
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,760
and I like you guys, I like this family.

978
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,840
I don't want to go against you guys.

979
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,400
I want to work things out.

980
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,520
That's why I'm trying, that's why I'm calling, man.

981
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,440
You know, if I wanted to be an asshole.

982
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,320
And I think, and I have to give you the answer

983
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,040
that there really is no process of working this out.

984
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,280
Like I'm not gonna, we're not gonna change the piece now

985
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,360
or at any point post publication

986
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,520
because of, you know, a certain way

987
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,880
you want them to characterize.

988
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,360
Right, again, it's not because,

989
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,640
that's not what I'm asking for.

990
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,320
Once again, Nick, you keep saying that.

991
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,680
I don't want something written the way I want it.

992
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,840
I'm not asking for that.

993
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,960
I'm asking just for the truth to be portrayed

994
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,320
and for balance and fairness.

995
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,160
That's what I'm asking.

996
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,820
And what I'm doing is pointing out the unbalancedness,

997
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,140
the unbalanced parts of this and the mistruths

998
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,700
and the inaccuracies.

999
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,980
I'm not sure what it is you're asking me for.

1000
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,940
Well, the way, because when you say story changed,

1001
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,940
it sounds, again, the way you put it is that

1002
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,380
we're not gonna change it the way you want it, Val.

1003
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,380
Right, again, that sounds like an asshole saying,

1004
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,980
I want you to do what I want to do.

1005
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,300
That's not what I'm asking.

1006
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,260
What I'm asking is for you to look at it

1007
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,540
from my point of view and you're the editor.

1008
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,380
You've never talked to me.

1009
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,380
You never met me before other than today and yesterday, right?

1010
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,740
And now you have a bit more understanding

1011
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,260
of who I am and how I speak based on my verbiage.

1012
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,980
Everything is subconsciously of your brains

1013
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,100
like a supercomputer.

1014
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,380
You're understanding me a little bit better, right?

1015
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,020
So now that you've done that and you read this piece

1016
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,540
and you see a difference, I'm sure,

1017
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,420
a schism between what David wrote

1018
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,820
and what you are experiencing now.

1019
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,220
I don't know what I do, no.

1020
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,780
Well, maybe you haven't, but not yet,

1021
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,960
but it'll grow, believe me.

1022
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,340
So the point is the-

1023
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,860
I have to tell you about it's so far it's not growing.

1024
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,700
I want to be honest.

1025
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,740
I know it's not, it doesn't change about the,

1026
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,460
what prompted the tracks about the brokerage account.

1027
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,780
Yeah, yeah.

1028
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,820
Because that's what David described it specifically.

1029
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,260
Nick, I get it, you're backing up your writers,

1030
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,540
you're loyal to David, David's loyalty, I get it.

1031
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,380
I understand that.

1032
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,780
I'm not trying to breach that loyalty.

1033
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,980
I'm not trying to get between you guys.

1034
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,380
I'm not trying to create a problem.

1035
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,940
I'm trying to tell you that this,

1036
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,260
I feel mischaracterized and why.

1037
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,860
Just doing the same thing I did

1038
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
when I first called you, all right?

1039
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm not asking you to change it

1040
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,940
based on how I want it to be.

1041
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,220
If you could change it to make things fair and correct,

1042
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,300
that would be great.

1043
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,420
And correct the things that are inaccurate

1044
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,180
and that have a factually inaccurate, that'd be great.

1045
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,460
Well, no, no, but you did say that unemployed musician,

1046
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,780
that is something, at the very beginning, Nick,

1047
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,180
you said, well, we're going to print soon.

1048
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,860
So let's get through this now

1049
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,100
in case we do have to make changes, right?

1050
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,460
That was the whole reason why we're talking.

1051
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,140
So that's why we're not talking tomorrow.

1052
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,140
I've made a couple of bullet points.

1053
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,060
I've not been writing down certain things

1054
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,420
that were issued a matter of opinion or interpretation.

1055
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,420
I wrote down the first bullet point I've written down

1056
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,060
was this unemployed bassist, he was self-employed.

1057
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,420
I mean, that was David.

1058
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,260
Great, okay.

1059
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,380
If I get off this one, the sooner I can raise it with him.

1060
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,340
Yeah, that's fine.

1061
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,420
Let's get through it then.

1062
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,980
I just don't know why you're arguing with me.

1063
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,300
All I want to do is tell you my side story.

1064
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,980
These are the points that I've found out.

1065
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,580
You can just let it go or leave it,

1066
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,700
but instead you're like, I want to fight with me.

1067
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,620
I don't understand it.

1068
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,620
I just, I don't know what's going on anymore.

1069
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,260
I'm very confused.

1070
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,980
I'm just trying to tell you the things

1071
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,940
that we agreed to yesterday.

1072
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,300
And you said, do this.

1073
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,820
And I said, okay, I'll do it.

1074
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,940
I spent four hours doing it.

1075
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,940
So here I am, relaying my homework to you, basically.

1076
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,300
And you want to fight me on every little thing.

1077
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,620
I'm not trying to do anything here, man.

1078
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,460
I don't want to get the impression that I'm fighting it.

1079
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,940
What I'm trying to do is steer us only towards

1080
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,220
factual things that we've got wrong

1081
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,820
that we can change with anything else.

1082
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,060
I'm just not going to change things based on...

1083
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,900
Okay, I got it.

1084
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,100
You know what I'm about to say.

1085
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,900
Yeah, I know what you're going to do.

1086
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,620
But that's another thing that I'm learning right now.

1087
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,380
I had no idea that that was,

1088
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,740
that something that cannot be done,

1089
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,820
that you can change the factual era,

1090
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,180
but you cannot change a mischaracterization.

1091
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,820
I didn't know that, but now I've learned that.

1092
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,660
Okay?

1093
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,580
I really thought that Rolling Stone does a cover story

1094
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,660
about a movie star and then there would be star calls

1095
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,180
and it says A, B, and C,

1096
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,460
and then they changed the story to reflect A, B, and C.

1097
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,300
I don't know, man.

1098
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,940
I've never, I've never been in this situation.

1099
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
When it comes to media,

1100
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,500
and I would assume you would know that, you know,

1101
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,460
journalists are the ones who write the stories.

1102
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,300
Yeah, I know.

1103
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,140
Nick.

1104
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,100
Don't get ahead of it after the fact.

1105
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Yeah, but sometimes they do

1106
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,100
when there's something that is inaccurate

1107
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,660
that I've seen happen before.

1108
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,460
And I've never been in this situation.

1109
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,740
It's a very unique, strange place to be right now.

1110
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,300
I've never been profiled before.

1111
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,180
Yeah, I've never been in any of this.

1112
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,020
This is very odd

1113
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,060
and I don't know how to react.

1114
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm doing the best I can, man.

1115
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,540
Right?

1116
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,060
So please bear with me on that.

1117
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,700
Okay.

1118
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,540
I don't know how to describe it,

1119
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,860
but the whole thing is like a very hurtful, basically.

1120
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,900
Like in a hugely public format.

1121
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,740
And that's sort of...

1122
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,340
Yeah, honestly, I can't.

1123
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,620
I mean, I totally get that.

1124
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,700
I mean, it's crazy to be written about

1125
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,940
in a publication this large,

1126
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,500
so I do want to hear your concerns.

1127
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,340
Okay.

1128
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,580
So the next paragraph is,

1129
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,940
so why do I put up with this?

1130
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,980
Is David says, and I already responded to that on Twitter,

1131
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,820
but just for the record, I'll tell you,

1132
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,900
it's extremely condescending to say,

1133
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,300
why do I put up with this person

1134
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,700
that I've just described to you as a terrible person?

1135
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,260
Because he's got emails that I need, right?

1136
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,100
That was his basic thing.

1137
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,020
And that's kind of funny.

1138
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,860
It's interesting.

1139
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,820
And I don't take any offense at that.

1140
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,420
I think it's a funny way of saying,

1141
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,160
Val's got good info,

1142
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,900
but I just want to also add that it does

1143
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,140
sustain the previous characterizations,

1144
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,060
what I perceive as mischaracterizations.

1145
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,820
I said, there's another sentence in that same paragraph,

1146
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,220
besides, there's something uncanny

1147
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,900
about how Mr. Brooksmouth's fearlessness

1148
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,740
and addiction to drama, dot, dot, dot.

1149
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,540
I forgot what comes after drama.

1150
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,500
Of course, it's kind that he wrote, I'm fearless.

1151
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,380
That's a very good thing.

1152
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,940
Finally, one positive note.

1153
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,940
When you say, David said something kind,

1154
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,740
fearlessness, that's all I got.

1155
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,580
And then he goes and spoils it all by saying,

1156
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,740
I'm addicted to drama.

1157
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,580
And I'm saying, he knows me better than this.

1158
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,620
And this is hurtful to me because he knows

1159
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,580
I'm not addicted to drama.

1160
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,380
I was caught up in a series of events

1161
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,540
outside of my control.

1162
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,580
My father killed himself and I went to go solve

1163
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,060
the mystery of his death.

1164
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,100
I did not seek out any drama.

1165
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,540
This is thrust upon me, right?

1166
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,660
All this shit was thrown at me.

1167
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,780
The Sony hack, I asked the hackers,

1168
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,820
yes, can you hack Deutsche Bank for me?

1169
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,340
That's not seeking drama.

1170
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,180
So that's the thing that's a mischaracterization.

1171
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,060
Again, this person that David's creating,

1172
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,060
that is not me.

1173
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,460
I was, I mean, to say I'm in pursuit of fame

1174
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,140
and attention to drama, it's a singular dismissive.

1175
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,140
It's also very hurtful and reductively terrible thing

1176
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,660
to do to anybody, let alone someone

1177
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,260
that you thought was a friend for five years, okay?

1178
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,220
So the next part is the same, hold on.

1179
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Okay, so the same thing here in the next paragraph.

1180
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,500
We might wish our whistleblowers were stoic,

1181
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,140
unimpeachable do-gooders.

1182
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,540
In reality, to let you in on a journalist's secret,

1183
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,100
they're more often like Val Brooksman.

1184
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,180
And I mean, this is something that's really stupid to say,

1185
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,460
show, don't tell, you know, like who is Val Brooksman?

1186
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,180
So when he says more like Val Brooksman,

1187
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,940
at this point in the story, where he's shown, okay,

1188
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,740
is a drug addict, credit card fraud,

1189
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,820
just negative descriptors, manic, unreliable,

1190
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,580
all this shit, you take 30, 40 negative things

1191
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,380
and plain balance them against one word, fearlessness.

1192
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,100
It does not help, it's not fair, it's not at all fair.

1193
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,620
Anyway, the next thing, angry, sorry.

1194
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,980
And then he says I'm angry, I'm slurring my speech,

1195
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,620
insisting without evidence that he knew why his,

1196
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,140
I called him, so I think this is the same paragraph.

1197
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,300
I call him and I have in quotes, dot, dot, dot,

1198
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,060
angry, slurring his speech,

1199
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,100
insisting without evidence that he knew why his father

1200
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,460
had killed himself and that had nothing to do

1201
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,900
with Deutsche Bank.

1202
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,740
So again, slur is an allusion to drunkenness,

1203
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,980
you know, of some sort of inebriation.

1204
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,700
And I'm saying like right now, really,

1205
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,820
he's gonna bring up more drugs again, right?

1206
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,060
Without a statement is very dismissive

1207
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,300
and an emphasis in the absence of my credibility.

1208
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,860
It's just again, I say these things and I call them,

1209
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,380
it's again, another pejorative basically, you know.

1210
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,980
And by the way, this is not factual

1211
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,660
because I did not speak to David until early March, 2014.

1212
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,260
That's the first time I ever spoke to him.

1213
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,660
I did in fact email him before that

1214
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,180
and his email is absolutely correct.

1215
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,460
But then he says I sort of, I picked up the phone

1216
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,500
or before long I was talking to him

1217
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,580
and slurring my speech, insisting, et cetera, et cetera,

1218
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,220
my dad killed himself and nothing to do with Deutsche.

1219
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,180
Yes, I did tell him that I think I know

1220
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,220
why my father killed himself and that's probably,

1221
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,460
and it was because of my mother,

1222
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,420
is what I was telling him at that part.

1223
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,060
But when he says there's nothing to do with Deutsche

1224
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,780
and the slur and the drunkenness, sorry, sorry, I'm getting,

1225
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,660
sorry, hold on a second, Nick.

1226
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,460
So I was in rehab from March till July, 2014.

1227
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,500
So when I spoke to David for the first time,

1228
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,020
he called me when I was in rehab.

1229
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,740
So there's no way that I was drunk

1230
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,340
and I was slurring my speech.

1231
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,300
So the illusion to this drunkenness is just inaccurate.

1232
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,580
And I can prove that a million different ways.

1233
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,540
That's when we started our relationship.

1234
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:17,180
When I was in rehab in Altamira in Sausalito,

1235
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,980
and I sent him a photo of the building that was on fire,

1236
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,260
which he said was randomly, again, in the story.

1237
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,340
You're a little over the place.

1238
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,660
No, I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry.

1239
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,300
Would you particular thing do you want me to be

1240
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,140
focused on here?

1241
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,740
I'm sorry, man, yeah, you're right.

1242
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,180
Just, okay, I guess the factual,

1243
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,660
the part that I guess is most important to you

1244
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,460
would be the factual and the, sorry, man.

1245
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,300
God, I need like a break.

1246
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,980
Can I call you in five minutes?

1247
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,820
Is it okay?

1248
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,100
It's terrible, I know.

1249
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,900
I know, I know, it's terrible.

1250
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Okay, all right, so let me get through this.

1251
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,100
I know, let me do the quick version.

1252
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,940
I'll get through this.

1253
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,300
I'll get through this, I'm sorry.

1254
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,140
Yeah, yeah.

1255
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,340
You know, you shared a lot of your life with David

1256
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,460
for many years.

1257
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,420
You opened yourself up.

1258
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,980
We wrote about you in the New York Times.

1259
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,420
That's a huge thing, and I want to make sure

1260
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,420
that you feel heard.

1261
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,020
I, can I, but I just do want to,

1262
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,540
well, I guess I just be repeating myself.

1263
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,220
I, you know, you know what I'm gonna say about

1264
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,100
how we're not gonna change.

1265
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,260
Right, I know, I know, I know.

1266
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,260
So, I do want to make sure that you feel heard,

1267
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,100
and you should definitely know that I'm gonna

1268
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,620
share all this with David.

1269
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,620
Please do, yes, please do, of course.

1270
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,940
But I don't, but I want to make sure

1271
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,340
that you have realistic expectations about

1272
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,460
some alterations to the story.

1273
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,860
Of course, dude, I have no expectations at all.

1274
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,180
So that's, that's how I'm going into this.

1275
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,220
I just want to be heard, and then you leave it all

1276
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,620
in your hands, you know.

1277
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,180
If you're gonna take a break now,

1278
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,460
if I could make a suggestion, it would be to

1279
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,340
make an organized list of your objections

1280
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,340
with the story.

1281
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,180
Right, right.

1282
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,580
And put them in groups, because I'm definitely,

1283
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,580
I'm so much more assumed to, you know,

1284
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:22,620
to Aaron's effect or something where you really disagree

1285
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,540
with something and can show why it's demonstrably false.

1286
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,500
Right, right, again, I'm sorry, yeah.

1287
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,460
We could group all the stuff about, you know,

1288
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,300
you know, what you see as an embellishing,

1289
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,220
you know, negative and positive attributes.

1290
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,060
Okay.

1291
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,940
That group of stuff, you know, I can listen to it,

1292
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,820
but that's probably where there's just gonna be no

1293
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,980
satisfaction. I got you.

1294
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,340
I got you, and I apologize.

1295
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,140
I'm usually not like all over the place,

1296
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,300
but again, it's just because I'm gonna get all emotional.

1297
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,900
Usually when I talk, I'm not emotionally attached

1298
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,620
to the material, you know.

1299
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,940
So that's why, but yeah, sorry, just give me five minutes

1300
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,020
and I'll call you right back, and I will do what you said.

1301
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,940
I'll take out the other parts and make this faster.

1302
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,060
Okay, all right, thank you.

1303
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,900
Thanks, Nick.

1304
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,740
Okay, bye.

1305
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,300
Thank you, Nick.

1306
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,300
Ah, ah, ah.

1307
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:27,780
Oh f...

1308
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Fuck.

1309
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:04,780
Oh shit, it's the recording.

1310
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:13,780
Ah, fuck.

1311
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:33,780
Hey, Val.

1312
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,780
Hey, Nick.

1313
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,780
Thanks.

1314
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,780
Sorry about that.

1315
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,780
I guess a Xanax in a cigarette kind of helps.

1316
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,780
So, yeah.

1317
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,780
Phew.

1318
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,780
Man, I was getting worked up there.

1319
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,780
Yeah.

1320
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,780
Sorry about that.

1321
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,780
So let's go to-

1322
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,780
You don't have to put us right about anything.

1323
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,780
Thank you.

1324
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,780
Okay.

1325
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,780
Thanks.

1326
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,780
So I guess we could jump to paragraph 23.

1327
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:01,780
I'll skip over the whole why I sent him the picture of the building on fire is not really

1328
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,780
relevant.

1329
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:09,340
So David writes in paragraph 23, four days later, I published an article describing the

1330
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,780
Fed's concerns period.

1331
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,780
The bank's shares fell 3%.

1332
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,440
Mr. Brooksman told me he felt empowered by having dented Georgia's market value by more

1333
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,780
than one billion.

1334
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:26,780
Now, this was kind of not horrifying, but it was disturbing for me to read because

1335
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:31,780
David and I have talked about this many times.

1336
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,780
There are two parts to this, and he only published one part and wrote one part.

1337
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:41,780
And part one, yes, I did feel some empowerment or some revenge that I had taken.

1338
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,780
I was able to swing back and I hit the target.

1339
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,780
I found purchase, right?

1340
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:52,780
But the second part, which David did not write, is that I thought it through and I realized

1341
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,780
how terrible it was because I had affected people that were not directly tied to Deutsche

1342
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,780
Bank.

1343
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,780
These are people's pensions.

1344
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,780
This was a mortgage.

1345
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,780
They're homes.

1346
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,780
They're leases.

1347
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,780
They're dental insurance, medical insurance, and I realized that that was disturbing to

1348
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,780
me that I did that.

1349
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:16,780
And David never, I mean, that's the second half of me, just as much as that first part

1350
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:21,780
of the vengeance is for the first half of me, and it's very indicative of the whole story.

1351
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,780
Do you know what I mean?

1352
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:28,780
Selective truth telling to paint a portrait that David is painting.

1353
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:33,780
And I just wanted to let you know that there is, you know, I mean, again, I'm not saying

1354
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,780
that you're going to change anything, but I just want to make it to show you an example,

1355
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,780
right?

1356
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,780
And that bothered me that he just said that it was bothering me.

1357
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,780
So it's factually inaccurate description of what happened.

1358
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,780
That is factually inaccurate of what happened.

1359
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,780
But I don't know.

1360
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,780
I'm confused.

1361
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,780
Is that not accurate?

1362
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,780
It's not.

1363
00:54:54,780 --> 00:55:00,780
I mean, our stories can't be 100 million words long keys.

1364
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,780
Could you call that?

1365
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,780
David's obligation is not to include every single fact that you consider relevant.

1366
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,780
Right.

1367
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,780
But had you read that when, like, say he handed it into you and you read it, would you see

1368
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,780
that as something relevant at the time?

1369
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,780
But he didn't give you the option to see that as relevant yet.

1370
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:25,780
So I'm not going to discuss what would be a draft or something that's not our final

1371
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,780
published document.

1372
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,780
Right.

1373
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,780
Sorry.

1374
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,780
Yeah, I don't mean that.

1375
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:35,780
I just mean, like, if you saw a bigger picture, perhaps you would have a different view of

1376
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,780
who this person is that David's writing about.

1377
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:43,780
And just selectively telling the truth, half of the truth is close to, you know, I mean,

1378
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,780
I tell Marie's seven-year-old that, you know, omitting a truth is the same thing as lying.

1379
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,780
So lies of omission.

1380
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,780
So I don't know if this considered the same thing in the eyes of the other time.

1381
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,780
I would not agree that this is a lie of omission or misrepresentation by omission.

1382
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,780
Okay.

1383
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,780
Okay.

1384
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,780
Okay.

1385
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,780
So then let's move on to the next one.

1386
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,780
So I was conflicted.

1387
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,780
Sorry.

1388
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,780
I wrote a lot about this.

1389
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,780
Yes, blah, blah, blah.

1390
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,780
But David knows all this stuff and he has it in his notes.

1391
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,780
We've talked about it for a very long time over the course of five years.

1392
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,780
So what makes a person crave the attention of journalists?

1393
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,780
Consider where Val Brooksman comes from.

1394
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,780
That sentence right there was another one that drove me mad.

1395
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,780
So I want to make it clear.

1396
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,780
And David knows this.

1397
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,780
You can ask him and he'll, of course, you'll agree with me.

1398
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,780
I have never approached a single journalist in my life.

1399
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,780
Every journalist came to me.

1400
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,780
Every single one.

1401
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,780
I've never reached out to anyone.

1402
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,780
I've never hunted a journalist.

1403
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,780
I never said, uh, do you want to, how about this for a story?

1404
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,780
Never.

1405
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,780
Everyone's always come to me and I have liberally given everybody.

1406
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,780
If I have, if I have information and data that helps them, I give it to them.

1407
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,780
I've never said no.

1408
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,780
And that's a huge problem.

1409
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,780
I just don't know how to say no to people.

1410
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:04,780
Uh, like I should have said no to David, I guess about a few things, but that is

1411
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,780
another mischaracterization.

1412
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,780
Just to say what makes a person crave the attention of journalists, obviously

1413
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,780
equates to Val, craves the attention of journalists.

1414
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,780
Right.

1415
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,780
So, uh, that bothers me considerably so.

1416
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:22,780
Um, and then he goes on to say that the reason, and I don't know, David doesn't

1417
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,780
exactly, uh, have a, you know, he's a great guy.

1418
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,780
He's a brilliant, brilliant guy.

1419
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,780
He's such a good writer, but he's not like the guy that's going to probe the

1420
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,780
depths of someone's psyche and come out with some answers.

1421
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,780
He's not that type of person.

1422
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,780
Um, so he decides to, uh, next thing he writes is about my childhood.

1423
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,780
Which, you know, is, is a fucked up childhood.

1424
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,780
I had one and he's pointing that out.

1425
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:48,780
But why to, to equate my fucked up childhood to craving the attention of

1426
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,780
journalists, that's a schism.

1427
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,780
Um, it's a, it does not equate.

1428
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,780
Um, you know, again, to me, but this is just how I felt when I saw it.

1429
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,780
It was, uh, strange.

1430
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,780
And he created something out of thin air that I crave the attention of

1431
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,780
journalists.

1432
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,780
He's again, telling and not showing.

1433
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:14,780
And he doesn't, and he, when he just, uh, describes my background, uh,

1434
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,780
now I'm just repeating myself next.

1435
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,780
Sorry, but you get my point.

1436
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,780
Right.

1437
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,780
Do you understand?

1438
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,780
Yeah.

1439
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,780
I get your point.

1440
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:22,780
Um, okay.

1441
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,780
Cool.

1442
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,780
So I can move on.

1443
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,780
I do hear you.

1444
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,780
Okay.

1445
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,780
Thanks.

1446
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,780
As long as you understand.

1447
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,780
Um, yeah.

1448
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,780
So six zero.

1449
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,780
Okay.

1450
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,780
So, uh, David leads, uh, sorry.

1451
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,780
Uh, okay.

1452
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,780
So we move on to this.

1453
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,780
We're almost done.

1454
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,780
Um, meanwhile, comma, Allah met and married Bill Brooksman, who was then an

1455
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,780
up and coming banker.

1456
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:48,780
Um, now to me, and I could be very wrong, but, uh, in the parlance of our

1457
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,780
times, up and coming banker, uh, is a sort of, you have already association

1458
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:59,780
with that, uh, term, uh, you have a sort of a, uh, a moneyed up, uh, young guy

1459
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,780
that's trying to, is hungry and trying to make his start in the world.

1460
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,780
Right.

1461
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,780
Um, and I know that in the book, it'll be much more clear and I, and I trust

1462
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,780
David on that.

1463
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:14,780
But my father, uh, was not, he was one of six children living barely above

1464
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,780
the poverty level in, in Illinois, son of a, literally son of a preacher

1465
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,780
man and, um, did everything on his own.

1466
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,780
So he wasn't this.

1467
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,780
I'm looking this up in the, in the dictionary on my Mac and it says, up

1468
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,780
and coming is defined as making good progress and likely to become successful.

1469
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,780
Okay.

1470
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,780
Yes.

1471
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,780
Uh, but wouldn't you say it also has a connotation, a social connotation as

1472
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,780
well?

1473
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,780
Like a, uh,

1474
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,780
I don't think so.

1475
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,780
No.

1476
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,780
I could, I could be wrong there, but I don't, up and coming just means

1477
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,780
somebody on the rise as far as, as far as I, as far as I know.

1478
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,780
Okay.

1479
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,780
It could just, I could be totally wrong on this too.

1480
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,780
I just, for some reason, I thought that it was like a class, a class system

1481
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,780
sort of thing.

1482
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,780
Sorry.

1483
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,780
I just want to think about on the make or something like that.

1484
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,780
There's a little more spin on that phrase, but on the make, on the make.

1485
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,780
Oh, sorry.

1486
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,780
Yeah.

1487
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,780
I thought on the make just means trying to get laid.

1488
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
Doesn't it?

1489
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,780
That's what that means.

1490
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,780
That's what it means in England.

1491
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,780
Yeah.

1492
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,780
If you're on the make, you're trying to get laid.

1493
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,780
Running a scam or something.

1494
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,780
Oh, okay.

1495
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,780
Anyway.

1496
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:18,780
So I think about that, that, that, that just means somebody who is on, who is

1497
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,780
doing, doing whatever I just read to you in the dictionary.

1498
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,780
I got you.

1499
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,780
Okay.

1500
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,780
That could be just, again, you're probably right.

1501
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Um, it's just the way I read it.

1502
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,780
It made it seem like my mother, cause I wrote a whole thing like, oh, then my mother

1503
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,780
must be this woman that's chasing a rich guy, which she was not.

1504
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,780
She was also, they were both not.

1505
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:40,780
No, no, I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't think that's, I didn't read it that way.

1506
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,780
Yeah.

1507
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,780
Okay.

1508
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,780
That could, again, maybe just the way I read it.

1509
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,780
Um, so we skip, skip forward.

1510
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,780
Um, Bill adopted him in same paragraph 26.

1511
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:56,780
Bill adopted him dash an angry, impulsive child, the strong anti-authority streak.

1512
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:03,780
Um, I remember that was when David and I looked for the Cook County records, we saw this written

1513
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:09,780
by a social, social worker, I think, um, someone that was in the system.

1514
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:15,780
And, um, my thing on this is that I don't remember that at all.

1515
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,780
Um, I don't know how true that is, but it's written by the social system.

1516
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,780
I, I, um, that's it.

1517
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,780
Um, that's it.

1518
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,780
That's all I want to say about that.

1519
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,780
I just don't remember that happening at all.

1520
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:34,780
I don't know any, I cannot say that it did happen or it did not happen.

1521
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,780
Um, paragraph 27.

1522
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,780
Oh, this is where it, this is where it really stinks.

1523
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,780
He wanted to be the center of attention to prove that he mattered.

1524
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:49,780
So again, this is the redundant, a redundant kind of arbitrary attack on my character.

1525
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,780
It doesn't help further the story.

1526
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:58,780
It doesn't do anything, but it attacked me and solidified this terrible portrayal of this horrible person.

1527
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,780
Uh, that is Val Brooksman now.

1528
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:08,780
You know, it's careless ultimately and it brings no, it doesn't, it doesn't help the story move forward.

1529
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:13,780
So like these, these sentences that are used could be used for something else, you know, adding to this.

1530
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:20,780
I just don't understand and why he would be, and to be able to say like, this is David, I'm an authority to prove.

1531
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,780
I'm an authority on what people think and believe, right?

1532
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:29,780
So Val wants to be the center of attention and the reason why is to prove that he matters.

1533
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:35,780
Now for paragraphs ago, he says Val wants to be the center of attention and he craves the attention of journalists.

1534
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:39,780
And his explanation of that is because of my crazy, terrible childhood.

1535
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,780
But now he changes it.

1536
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,780
Now I want to be the center of attention to prove that I matter.

1537
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,780
Like, do you see that?

1538
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,780
It's very, it doesn't make sense.

1539
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:55,780
Um, and then he says that that's part of the reason he'd be quote unquote, that's part of the reason he became a rocker.

1540
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,780
It's less lonely with an audience.

1541
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,780
He once told me, true.

1542
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:06,780
I'd said that and it's on, uh, David and I recorded our fact checking for two days straight and it's on there and that's absolutely true.

1543
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:16,780
Um, but it's used not to, uh, to, uh, what's, I don't know, I forgot the word amongst literary people,

1544
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:23,780
but to color, to color a person's character or the story, it's used to show me again in a negative, pejorative light.

1545
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,780
So, uh, it's, that's all I wanted to say.

1546
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,780
It's, uh, sorry.

1547
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,780
I thought we were going to focus on this call on the more technical stuff.

1548
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,780
Yeah, sorry.

1549
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,780
Sorry.

1550
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,780
Sorry.

1551
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,780
I just, uh, was going through the thing.

1552
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,780
I'm skipping over a lot.

1553
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,780
Um, uh, David the adjudicator, so he's, okay, sorry.

1554
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,780
When his father died and Mr. Brooksman came into possession of his documents, I believe this is paragraph.

1555
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,780
I got it here.

1556
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,780
Oh, you got it? Okay.

1557
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:57,780
When his father died and Mr. Brooksman came into possession of his documents, he finally had an opportunity to make the world pay attention.

1558
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:08,780
Uh, again, it's, I mean, I guess this is part of the same thing, a very subjective thing to say, I know why Val does this without any proof, without any showing.

1559
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,780
It's only telling, telling, telling.

1560
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,780
And it's kind of disgusting.

1561
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:17,780
I felt disgusted and like it's a careless judgment and it came to a head for me at the here in this, in the story.

1562
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,780
I kind of lost my shit when I read this for the second time.

1563
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:25,780
See, when my father died, I was so heartbroken for a very fucking long time.

1564
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,780
I didn't see anything else but my father, but my father, that's it.

1565
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:39,780
And I wanted to know why he killed himself and for David to paint me during this fucking terrible phase in my life is this horrible person to, man, sorry.

1566
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,780
You know, it's not like I'm fucking crying.

1567
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,780
It's ridiculous.

1568
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,780
Hold on.

1569
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:46,780
Sorry.

1570
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,780
No, no, it's okay.

1571
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,780
It's all.

1572
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,780
It's, uh, you know, it's like, fuck.

1573
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,780
It's hurtful.

1574
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,780
Okay.

1575
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:57,780
So.

1576
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,780
Yeah.

1577
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,780
Take your time.

1578
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,780
Sorry.

1579
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,780
Sorry.

1580
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,780
Hold on.

1581
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:15,780
So it's like, I can't talk, man.

1582
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,780
Sorry.

1583
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,780
I can't talk.

1584
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,780
Okay.

1585
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,780
It's like opportunistic.

1586
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,780
I'm an opportunistic person.

1587
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,780
You know, dude, I can't.

1588
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,780
Fuck.

1589
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,780
Just gather yourself.

1590
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,780
It's fine.

1591
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:28,780
Take your time.

1592
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,780
All right.

1593
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,780
It's all right.

1594
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,780
Just one second.

1595
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,780
Okay.

1596
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:33,780
Okay.

1597
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:56,780
Um, so it shows me as an opportunistic person using my father's death for my own selfish pursuits.

1598
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:02,780
And that's hurtful, especially in this fucking New York Times.

1599
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,780
Did you see that?

1600
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:10,780
And see a friend, someone I thought was a friend, write that.

1601
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:11,780
So fuck me.

1602
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,780
I don't know if I can go further right now.

1603
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,780
I mean, I got to call you back again.

1604
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,780
Well, I'm sorry, man.

1605
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:20,780
I need to head.

1606
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,780
Look, I don't want to end this year.

1607
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,780
I really don't want to end this year.

1608
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,780
I need to head home shortly.

1609
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,780
Yeah, I know.

1610
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,780
I'm sorry, dude.

1611
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,780
I'm sorry to throw all this on you.

1612
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,780
This is terrible.

1613
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,780
I'm very sorry.

1614
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:37,780
Look, I, I, it's a difficult, I know it's difficult for you.

1615
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:38,780
It's difficult to hear.

1616
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,780
And I'm going to share all this with David.

1617
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,780
I, you know, I'm, I really am sorry that this is hit you like this.

1618
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:51,780
And, you know, I, I, I, please know that you are being heard here.

1619
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,780
And I'm going to tell all this to David.

1620
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,780
Okay.

1621
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,780
Okay.

1622
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,780
Yeah.

1623
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,780
Thank you.

1624
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,780
I mean, I'll, you know what?

1625
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,780
I'll just write the rest and I'll send it to you and make it a little bit easier.

1626
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,780
Nick.

1627
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,780
Okay.

1628
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:07,780
And then if you want some clarifications or anything, just give me a call.

1629
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,780
Okay.

1630

Take care, Val.
