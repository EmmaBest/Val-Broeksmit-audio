WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
Say that again, but say again you you you I sorry I got right this down now because now you lost me

00:07.480 --> 00:09.480
Hold on. Let me get a pen. Oh

00:12.480 --> 00:14.480
There's the band-aids

00:24.640 --> 00:26.640
By the way, that's an old check of mine

00:30.680 --> 00:34.040
Make people feel more comfortable when I say oh

00:35.040 --> 00:38.520
Hold on. Let me just get a pen and piece of paper so I can write this down

00:39.120 --> 00:41.640
So that way you don't think that I'm recording you

00:45.000 --> 00:50.240
All right, what do I say what do I say? I did I actually do have a pen and paper now you said ask him what?

00:52.160 --> 00:57.800
So I initially asked him like why can't you proactively take

00:58.720 --> 01:03.800
Information, okay, why can't you proactively pro is proactive of a hyphen?

01:05.080 --> 01:10.000
Proactively no retain retain information from me

01:11.160 --> 01:15.080
Okay, I'll obtain obtain. Oh not retain

01:16.680 --> 01:20.000
Well, you can retain it. No, you can retain anything

01:20.960 --> 01:25.420
You know a nearly you can retain a lot in a retentive information

01:26.420 --> 01:31.420
Why can't you anyway proactively you figure out how you want to phrase that okay?

01:31.420 --> 01:36.260
We and then if you tap the answers and doesn't give you a direct answer, okay?

01:37.220 --> 01:39.220
ask him if

01:42.860 --> 01:45.700
The information that he could receive from you

01:46.300 --> 01:51.820
Have privileged information which tainted him off a case. Oh

01:52.460 --> 01:58.860
Okay, so any info he received for me could contain may contain

01:59.900 --> 02:01.900
Privileged information

02:02.300 --> 02:04.300
That would take him off the case

02:05.660 --> 02:09.500
Yeah, and then if he doesn't answer there say

02:10.020 --> 02:16.620
Did information that you provided get him in trouble or did he just get himself in trouble on

02:17.340 --> 02:18.860
the rush of stuff

02:18.860 --> 02:20.860
Like

02:21.180 --> 02:23.180
Like

02:24.180 --> 02:30.700
Is it something that it's specific to you where like if you go and you give information to David

02:30.780 --> 02:35.180
Is that obstruction gonna go to David or is that just sticking with Tim?

02:36.380 --> 02:43.820
Because he misbehaved himself and fucked up somewhere along. Oh, no Tim is saying if I give data to him to not to not to

02:44.460 --> 02:50.260
Co but to him it would be obstruction or if he asked asked me

02:55.300 --> 03:00.940
Yeah, and I think that was by trusting me because the next thing everything's on the New York Times

03:03.740 --> 03:07.740
Right, yeah, but David Co is calling me back right now. Hold on. Let me turn on the word

03:09.260 --> 03:11.260
Let me call you right back. Okay

03:12.220 --> 03:14.220
Hello

03:14.380 --> 03:16.380
David, what's up? What happened?

03:16.780 --> 03:20.620
Well, I told you I had a meeting. Okay. I thought you were hanging up already

03:21.900 --> 03:26.380
Now, sorry. Okay. Good. I told you when remember when I first called you I said hey

03:26.380 --> 03:30.380
I gotta go to meeting in five minutes and then 15 minutes later. I said, okay. I gotta go to the meeting

03:30.620 --> 03:33.740
Hey, what did I say? I'm like, dude, I told you I had to go to the meeting. What are you?

03:34.140 --> 03:38.540
Sorry, I missed that five minutes thing. I didn't hear that one. Sorry. I just maybe the phone died

03:38.620 --> 03:42.940
But uh, okay. Sorry. So what do you think?

03:44.300 --> 03:49.580
Um, like I said the stuff with Rick Cohen and Kurt Weldon, I mean

03:51.020 --> 03:56.540
I mean, I'll add the Kurt Weldon stuff in see if that interests anyone. Um, I can get you a dossier

03:57.340 --> 03:58.460
like a

03:58.460 --> 04:01.260
Dossier like I'm sort of a so you understand it

04:01.660 --> 04:07.740
Andrew, I think would be happy to provide one or maybe he's already got one like an outline of the basic gist of the whole story

04:09.020 --> 04:11.260
And the players yeah, and the names and players involved

04:12.300 --> 04:14.700
Okay, I'll do that. Let me write that down. Actually, hold on

04:15.660 --> 04:22.300
Because otherwise I am gonna forget this. Okay, so uh dossier on Weldon and Russian thing

04:22.540 --> 04:26.620
But that's separate from fsb guy in la so it's two

04:27.340 --> 04:28.860
Okay

04:28.860 --> 04:33.260
Did you do you text me the fsb guy's name yet or I have not no

04:33.900 --> 04:35.900
Oh, I'm still writing this down dossier and Weldon

04:36.860 --> 04:38.860
Okay, um

04:39.900 --> 04:45.820
You know what could we use signal from now on or I mean are you that secure with your with your iMessages?

04:47.260 --> 04:54.060
I mean, well, I don't have signal when we can install signal on our work phone. I mean, I just buy a drop phone and use it

04:54.140 --> 05:00.540
But are you worried about people like hacking in and stealing stuff? Yeah, you know, it's pretty

05:01.100 --> 05:02.700
It

05:02.700 --> 05:06.860
I mean if I can do it be someone else will do it to me, you know, so I'm pretty sure people

05:07.740 --> 05:12.220
Uh, just iMessage. I don't know. I mean, it's encrypted end to end. So I don't know why maybe I'm just being

05:12.780 --> 05:16.380
A paranoid, but let me just check my text. So I I'll have it right here

05:16.540 --> 05:18.620
It's better to tell it to you than to text it is what I mean

05:19.340 --> 05:21.340
For that in-lessons signal

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
Um, we think this woman's number

05:24.460 --> 05:26.460
Um

05:26.540 --> 05:28.860
Are you still in Houston in Houston?

05:29.740 --> 05:31.740
Mm-hmm. Let me see this thing

05:35.900 --> 05:37.900
Oh, here we go. Okay, um

05:39.500 --> 05:45.180
This name is k r b o y a n. That's the family name

05:46.300 --> 05:48.060
Sorry to see that name again

05:48.060 --> 05:50.060
k r b

05:51.340 --> 05:53.340
O y a n

05:54.300 --> 05:56.300
I

05:59.900 --> 06:06.060
Like uh co david co. Okay are like ricochet be like uh bonanza

06:06.620 --> 06:12.860
Oh like orient why like yandex a antelope and neuro

06:15.180 --> 06:17.180
Okay, sounds good. Is that like

06:18.060 --> 06:22.780
Sorry, that's the last name. Yeah, that's a family name. Um the number

06:23.340 --> 06:26.540
Wait, wait, uh, okay number four two four

06:27.340 --> 06:31.900
Three four six four nine zero four. That's one of his main. That's his main number

06:35.020 --> 06:39.900
Three four six four nine zed four

06:42.940 --> 06:44.940
Oh, sorry, wait, wait, sorry, that's that's

06:45.900 --> 06:49.900
Sorry, that's the wrong one. Sorry. It's eight seven zero across that out. That's a different number

06:50.380 --> 06:52.380
Actually, I don't know what the hell is that number? Wait

06:53.820 --> 06:55.820
Yeah, you know what keep that number. That's the second number

06:56.540 --> 06:59.260
Try this. This is the other one. I think this is a fake. Um

06:59.820 --> 07:03.180
This is an internet number though because it has a it's the eight seven zero

07:03.980 --> 07:07.100
eight zero zero eight zero eight zero

07:09.900 --> 07:13.260
Oh, yeah, yeah d o b, uh

07:14.380 --> 07:20.460
January 13th 1983 first name arman a r m a n

07:23.580 --> 07:31.980
Okay, so what is our fsp officer up to? Yes. Why is he in la? And why is he uh,

07:32.940 --> 07:34.940
Why is he so close to me now?

07:37.820 --> 07:39.820
And am I being paranoid

07:39.820 --> 07:45.040
Because this woman she came into my life very strangely I hired a private investigator

07:46.060 --> 07:51.340
And the private investigator, uh, really good guy worked under the police force for a long time

07:51.340 --> 07:53.100
I might have told you this already

07:53.100 --> 07:59.340
30 years on the force and then deputy sheriff and then he was a detective for many of those years and

08:00.220 --> 08:06.940
Um instead of going to politics and becoming a sheriff he went became p. I and he's a very renowned well-known p. I

08:07.740 --> 08:09.740
He's introduced me to her

08:09.900 --> 08:14.300
And said that she's very interested in these little cords. I have these things

08:15.820 --> 08:17.020
I kind of

08:17.100 --> 08:22.460
I don't make them, but I sort of have like a it's like a hobby. You know the omg cords

08:24.940 --> 08:28.620
I can't say I do oh come on. You're a hacker. I thought you're a hacker

08:29.740 --> 08:33.020
omg card code no cord omg

08:34.460 --> 08:38.940
Oh, uh, so a guy named is a really good hacker named mg

08:40.860 --> 08:45.260
Um, you developed a really good demon seed is this sort of company he goes by demon seed

08:45.980 --> 08:52.540
and he uh great really good with encryption actually that's how I got to know him in 2016 I I heard is uh

08:53.340 --> 08:54.700
um

08:54.700 --> 08:59.420
He gave like a lecture on his encryption. They was developing for he's trying to get people into it

08:59.420 --> 09:03.740
But he was pretty good. It was like a signal before signal or around the same time signal. What's going on?

09:04.300 --> 09:06.780
but was he was really good at making these sort of

09:07.740 --> 09:10.700
So what do you call him like a usb killers or usb hacks?

09:11.500 --> 09:16.780
So if someone comes over hey, David, can I can I use your uh charger to charge up my iphone?

09:16.860 --> 09:20.220
And you're like, oh, yeah, here you go and you give him one of the chargers the cords

09:20.860 --> 09:24.540
And he plugs it in and the cord just sort of uh

09:26.060 --> 09:28.060
It does a um, it doesn't acquisition

09:28.620 --> 09:32.780
Immediately of all the data on your phone. Well, not all the data, but the high-value data

09:33.420 --> 09:37.980
Important stuff and the best part about about it is that it's it's a web server

09:38.620 --> 09:43.900
So you can log in to the damn cord and you can deliver payloads. You can do whatever, you know

09:45.180 --> 09:51.180
There's a usb cable that will automatically dump an entire phone. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool, huh?

09:51.820 --> 09:54.220
It's actually well, it's interesting. I

09:55.260 --> 09:57.260
Based on what I

09:57.980 --> 09:59.980
know of most phones

10:02.140 --> 10:06.060
I would say that the claim sounds a little bit excessive. I mean, there's some stuff you can

10:06.220 --> 10:10.540
Well, I'll tell you what come over come over to my house and charge your phone and I'll show you

10:15.420 --> 10:19.180
It's a I know it's a joke. I'm saying I'll show you that I'll show you I'll do it

10:19.180 --> 10:21.420
I'll show you a thing for it, but I have to

10:22.460 --> 10:24.460
I have

10:26.140 --> 10:31.420
Yes, yes, it's called uh because oh mg is the the guy's name and he just put it o in front of it

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
So it's like, oh my god, you know omg

10:34.460 --> 10:38.780
Yeah, but I have to tweak it because the way it's sort of sold

10:39.420 --> 10:44.220
Honestly, it's there's some like, uh, it's a little like a miss uh miss not miss no

10:44.220 --> 10:45.420
It's a miss uh

10:45.420 --> 10:50.860
It's bad advertising because it sort of alludes to the fact that it will dump the whole fucking thing from the phone

10:51.660 --> 10:57.820
But really when you get it and you're like, what is this you unbox it? It's really the opposite. It's for the computer

10:58.780 --> 11:02.780
So, uh, but I looked it's a little different than a phone. That's what I'm saying

11:03.260 --> 11:07.500
Yeah, I know the claim that you can just plug a phone in and it'll dump everything

11:07.740 --> 11:12.460
But that's where I went there something I really I'm like, I really got a loot which

11:13.100 --> 11:14.780
Is possible

11:14.780 --> 11:19.740
I would I'll be very suspicious if it actually worked. Well, that's what I'm telling you. That's where I come in

11:20.780 --> 11:24.140
And I did my a little tweak on it. So I make it work like it's supposed to work

11:24.220 --> 11:26.220
Look, I thought it was going to work

11:26.220 --> 11:31.180
And it's not as hard as you think because uh one you always do is get by the passcode and remember

11:31.180 --> 11:33.660
These are for max mostly and for iphone's

11:34.380 --> 11:39.580
So the passcode once you can get past that it's easy because you just trick it into thinking it's an iphone

11:40.220 --> 11:45.260
It's not that hard. It's if it thinks if it thinks it's itunes passcode, but sorry

11:47.100 --> 11:50.780
Again, like that's what I mean is like there's there's a lot of other steps that need to happen

11:50.780 --> 11:55.660
Like the passcode is the very first hurdle you have to right get past exactly

11:56.780 --> 12:00.140
Well, you what what idiot is gonna put their passcode in after they plug it into

12:00.540 --> 12:02.540
No, no, no, no

12:02.780 --> 12:08.700
Of course, but no, no what the thing is you nowadays you have to hit trust this computer or trust this phone, right?

12:09.340 --> 12:09.820
right

12:09.820 --> 12:15.900
So if you can already if the if the if you can emulate emulate the itunes software

12:16.220 --> 12:23.580
Okay, which is just itunes and it's already pretty public you can find that that it's you emulate that and so the

12:24.060 --> 12:27.660
Computer believes that you've already accepted this handshake. This handshake has been

12:29.500 --> 12:34.380
Stored in somewhere in a cookie somewhere in there or a token or whatever the fuck it sees they do

12:35.180 --> 12:37.180
It's actually a token

12:38.060 --> 12:42.220
Then it's then it's okay, then you can get bypass the passcode, you know

12:43.020 --> 12:46.860
And what you can get from another payload called lock scream

12:47.660 --> 12:49.900
But somebody developed a while ago is very good

12:50.540 --> 12:56.140
Is you can get the actual passcode so it'll it'll give you the passcode it gets into that little

12:56.700 --> 13:01.660
You know, what's that thing every iphone has it's like a it's like a it's just a little file. I can't remember name

13:02.620 --> 13:05.740
Yeah, I think you're gonna go lock file. So you just basically gets a lock file

13:06.460 --> 13:08.460
Which is why it's called lock scream, you know

13:09.340 --> 13:15.100
And so you incorporate that is payload number one and then the second one you get the credentials with the

13:15.660 --> 13:19.900
You know, what's beautiful is I don't have to write anything. You just copy paste other people's scripts. So

13:20.700 --> 13:22.700
And there's 12 different

13:22.700 --> 13:24.700
Slots and banks for payloads

13:25.340 --> 13:27.340
It's really quite a cool thing

13:27.580 --> 13:30.540
So anyway, I'm trying to I told this to my private investigator

13:31.020 --> 13:36.140
He's like really I said, yeah, he's like, okay value. You know what I got I'll tell you what I'll do

13:36.700 --> 13:41.340
I'm gonna work for you guys and you don't have to pay me. I just want a one painting from Marie

13:41.820 --> 13:46.540
You know, and I want you to hook me up with one of these chords and a phone

13:47.260 --> 13:51.980
Uh, you know, you know the phones that what do you call them the you can I can with blue dirt via bluetooth

13:52.060 --> 13:57.500
Or via the rfi d chip or both I put my phone next to yours and it pulls all the data

13:59.420 --> 14:01.420
What do you call that?

14:01.580 --> 14:04.540
Well, I mean to get that claim is also very

14:05.260 --> 14:07.260
Uh

14:07.660 --> 14:13.420
I've heard and I've seen some stuff, but it's not as simple as like I put my phone next year and it feels everything

14:13.820 --> 14:18.060
Well, you then you are buddy you're you are out of the loop because I have seen those and they are

14:18.620 --> 14:23.580
Available and they do work and funny enough the only the last time I saw it was my friend Sydney

14:23.580 --> 14:27.980
It was getting divorced and her husband had that had that phone and he uh,

14:28.540 --> 14:33.660
He pulled all her data out and it was really quite amazing and that was in 2015

14:35.340 --> 14:38.460
But at that time it took 30 minutes, so he had to leave

14:39.020 --> 14:41.100
His phone on top of hers for 30 minutes

14:41.180 --> 14:43.660
So that was the only problem was getting that to happen for 30 minutes

14:43.660 --> 14:49.740
But nowadays you don't have to have it on top of the other phone. It can be within about one the six half a foot radius

14:50.780 --> 14:54.620
So that's why I suspect rfi d is the new way it's going in not bluetooth

14:55.260 --> 15:00.780
Because you know, that's the only you can bluetooth you can go you know pretty far, but rfi d you've got to be right there, you know

15:01.740 --> 15:06.140
Still it's a lot of there's still a lot of data to pull over um that channel

15:08.220 --> 15:11.740
I mean that handshake you can't handle much. That's why they only send out like a couple numbers

15:11.980 --> 15:16.780
You know, it's like call and response with something and then decrypt it on rfi d

15:17.580 --> 15:22.460
So that's why you can only get the numbers and you can get um the messages are too big

15:23.100 --> 15:28.380
You're not getting the full dump for the phone. Well, you're getting call on the desk or maybe messages or something

15:28.620 --> 15:33.980
Well, no, no, that's the thing at first you're not getting the full dump, but then you can turn on the bluetooth

15:34.460 --> 15:36.460
Okay, and from the bluetooth you'll get the full dump

15:37.420 --> 15:43.020
So the malware will will do will have a two-step basically two prong attack

15:44.140 --> 15:48.620
How does it uh download the malware onto the victim phone from the bluetooth connection

15:49.660 --> 15:52.940
But how does it initiate a bluetooth connection without a handshake?

15:53.260 --> 15:57.980
Well, it's remember how you it's you know how like a vpn won't let you turn off the wi-fi

15:58.380 --> 16:01.260
There's a little trick in in apple that just has that stupid

16:01.420 --> 16:07.660
Some there's the bluetooth the vpn people figured out first. It's a little hack. It's not even a hack. It's just built into the code

16:08.220 --> 16:10.220
um, so if you have a

16:10.460 --> 16:13.820
Every time the user turns it off it goes the root turns it back on

16:15.100 --> 16:20.540
So and you can do that for the for that toggle that button which means you can do it for every other toggle button

16:21.820 --> 16:23.100
Wait, so

16:23.100 --> 16:26.300
How does so there's a signal that sends to the victim phone?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.620
Victim phone

16:28.620 --> 16:36.300
Then accepts this bluetooth connection without validation. No. No. No. No the the signal the signal is sent through rfid chat

16:36.780 --> 16:38.780
or for the rfid frequency

16:39.180 --> 16:45.100
um, and there's a second frequency which is not rfid, but it's like ic or is uh our

16:46.140 --> 16:49.020
There's a third one in there too. That's involved and those two

16:49.740 --> 16:51.740
Uh

16:51.740 --> 16:54.140
Shit, it's it's the credit card. What do credit cards use again?

16:55.260 --> 16:58.700
Yes, nfc. You're right. nfc rfid and fc

16:58.780 --> 17:01.500
So I think it's nfc that does the initial handshake. Sorry

17:01.900 --> 17:04.300
Then rfid and then bluetooth

17:04.380 --> 17:08.940
But at the end of the day it's always bluetooth that pulls the data because that is the fastest way to do it

17:09.420 --> 17:12.460
And the way it tricks the into the authentication

17:13.020 --> 17:17.980
Is that it deoths first everything around it and then reoff on the uh

17:18.460 --> 17:22.940
On the up on the reoff. There's somehow is uh, I don't I'm not sure exactly

17:23.100 --> 17:27.260
I'm like, I'm not a coder, but I can take a look at it and see what it is, but I don't know

17:27.980 --> 17:30.220
Like that's where I can tell you I don't know but it just does it

17:31.260 --> 17:35.100
And I think it has to do with the root if you if you can root it

17:35.740 --> 17:37.740
um, you can

17:38.860 --> 17:40.860
Via bluetooth

17:40.860 --> 17:42.860
Because uh, ios

17:44.300 --> 17:46.300
Yeah, no

17:52.300 --> 17:57.500
Dude you got to get in the field more man. I'm telling you, sydney would never use anything but an iphone

17:57.820 --> 17:59.820
She's one of those people, you know

17:59.980 --> 18:02.940
Um, since whatever whatever iphone's became a status symbol

18:02.940 --> 18:06.780
She's she's one of those in the in the husband is a billionaire. So he has no

18:07.340 --> 18:09.820
He has unlimited access to rnd

18:11.420 --> 18:13.420
Okay, so remember that too. Yeah

18:14.940 --> 18:16.940
I don't anyway, I don't know whatever

18:17.820 --> 18:19.820
The reason I say that is because um

18:20.300 --> 18:23.900
With unlimited access you can hire a team of hackers to do this for you

18:23.900 --> 18:29.100
But he didn't need to do that you can you can buy one you realize that I I do pen testing like I

18:29.980 --> 18:32.700
Whatever it doesn't no, no. I'm not tell me you do pen testing

18:33.580 --> 18:39.420
But whatever it is. Tell me it's not it's not worth like trying to figure out like how this has worked

18:40.140 --> 18:43.580
I'd like to know. No, I like the questions because you're making me think it's good

18:43.820 --> 18:46.620
Usually I just do stuff by instinct and then

18:49.980 --> 18:51.980
Yeah, whatever man, what

18:52.780 --> 18:58.300
What i'm saying is like I think the claim that you're making might be conflated with other data that might also be present

18:58.300 --> 19:00.780
There might be a lot of other things that also have to happen

19:01.340 --> 19:06.380
In order for this thing to work. Well, he's not gonna look. We're not getting we're not getting photos. That's not happening

19:06.540 --> 19:09.020
All right, we're not getting photos and videos. We're getting messages

19:09.420 --> 19:15.900
You get a full full everything on the phone. That's a clone. That's a lot. That's different a lot of information

19:16.060 --> 19:21.980
Sorry, I misspoke. I misspoke. That's a that's a clone like a complete clone the reason why I know that that's not true

19:21.980 --> 19:25.340
Is because just based on data throughput alone

19:26.060 --> 19:29.100
Like you say you have a regular iPhone that's like 64 gigs

19:29.580 --> 19:34.780
You know like 64 gigs with the data just transfer that data alone

19:35.180 --> 19:37.180
Not via either type wirelessly

19:37.500 --> 19:42.140
I mean at best at best you're gonna get like 10 15 megabytes per second

19:42.380 --> 19:45.580
And that's if you're like burning through it and you're like phone to phone

19:46.300 --> 19:50.700
10 to 15 megabytes per second think about that it takes forever to get 64 gigs

19:51.180 --> 19:53.180
So if you thought that someone's just gonna like

19:53.340 --> 19:54.380
Oh

19:54.380 --> 19:59.740
And I'm gonna grab everything that's what I mean. It's like yeah, what if it's the wi-fi that's almost impossible

19:59.900 --> 20:01.660
It must be the wi-fi

20:01.660 --> 20:05.660
No, it's not it would be the wi-fi because if you can turn on the wi-fi and hotspot

20:06.220 --> 20:09.420
Hotspot the phone. Yeah, but like the phone can't

20:10.220 --> 20:15.020
A phone doesn't have the native ability to transfer something wi-fi to wi-fi right like

20:15.260 --> 20:18.220
Think if you have that you have an iPhone right how many ways can you transfer data?

20:18.460 --> 20:21.500
You can airdrop it you can bluetooth it which is the same thing

20:21.900 --> 20:27.740
You can transfer via wi-fi, but it has to have a specific protocol that allows it to transfer that data. So like

20:28.460 --> 20:30.460
Anyway, no, no

20:31.340 --> 20:34.620
But that's what I'm saying. It's like when you make this claim like oh, I have enough to hold on like

20:34.700 --> 20:38.860
No, no, but it verifies if you what you just said was the missing the link

20:39.420 --> 20:42.060
Because it just it verifies what I was telling you before it is

20:42.620 --> 20:46.700
It has to be bluetooth because it is the airdrop the airdrop is the fastest way to do it

20:46.780 --> 20:48.780
It's actually faster than wi-fi close differences

20:49.260 --> 20:55.340
That's gotta be it airdropping something also has a bunch of other security protocols that hey, if someone's cracked it

20:55.420 --> 20:59.020
Maybe they have I mean there's always new things every day that I know I learned about

20:59.580 --> 21:01.580
But it seems

21:02.780 --> 21:07.740
Here's the other thing is we get a lot of these claims and then we go look at it and it's fucking bullshit

21:07.900 --> 21:09.900
And then total bullshit where some

21:10.460 --> 21:15.420
Is just scamming other pretend hackers. I'm not telling you something I heard from somebody. This isn't like a

21:16.140 --> 21:19.340
Gossipy thing. I'm telling you something that I that I've seen and I know

21:19.980 --> 21:23.180
You know, maybe I got scammed. Maybe someone pulled the wool over from my eyes or something

21:23.260 --> 21:25.980
They use some other, you know, it's a good parlor trick. It's possible

21:26.620 --> 21:29.820
But I don't I don't know. I'll just I look into it. I mean I will look at

21:30.700 --> 21:32.700
Here's the other thing too is like

21:33.260 --> 21:38.700
Like I am interested in this stuff and the reason is because you know, we need to keep abreast of like what's the latest hack

21:38.700 --> 21:41.980
What's the latest vulnerability and it's always changing but

21:42.940 --> 21:45.500
You're realistically like this type of information

21:46.940 --> 21:51.660
If from an investigative standpoint is invaluable to us unless someone's using it to do something bad something illegal

21:52.140 --> 21:54.700
Like breaking into someone's phone is already illegal

21:54.860 --> 21:59.500
But you know, it's like if a proof of concept is you're just like a white hacker

21:59.900 --> 22:03.580
You're trying to find vulnerabilities. Yeah, they do it all the time. They publish white papers and

22:04.140 --> 22:07.340
You know, we read them and we go to you know, trainings on them and things like that

22:07.740 --> 22:11.580
But there's nothing illegal about that, right? So it's right while it's interesting. It's not

22:12.540 --> 22:14.540
It's only illegal if you use it

22:14.540 --> 22:18.300
And by the way, I'm just this is a side adage for the main story I was telling you

22:18.300 --> 22:21.820
We just got stuck here because it's fun to talk shop for some for once in a while

22:22.620 --> 22:28.940
But yeah, the main gist is that they wanted they they were interested in developing these things as a mass production kind of thing

22:29.580 --> 22:33.420
so, um, I got called into this meeting and uh

22:34.140 --> 22:40.060
And the lawyer was there. She wants to uh, either fund it. I wasn't quite sure what she wanted

22:40.700 --> 22:42.700
Other than

22:44.940 --> 22:51.100
Um, yeah, why he's a good guy. Okay. Yeah porter p o r t e r

22:52.380 --> 22:58.700
Order that last name. Yes, uh, uh, john. I don't know if it's an h or an n. I think it's I think it's john with an h

22:59.660 --> 23:01.660
But he's a he's a good dude

23:01.660 --> 23:05.020
Yeah, he has he owned a uh, he was sorry. He's the the warden

23:06.060 --> 23:08.300
He was the warden of a of a prison out here

23:09.420 --> 23:12.700
After that for a while too. No, he's an interesting guy. Very clever

23:13.660 --> 23:16.940
He's a former bluthangeles county sheriff's officer

23:17.100 --> 23:20.060
Bakersfield Bakersfield deputy deputy sheriff

23:20.780 --> 23:24.940
And there was a time when there was constables in california. Is that correct? There's a constable

23:26.140 --> 23:32.540
And so back then he used to work in the constables office or something. I'm not exactly sure. I'll ask him. He's coming by today

23:33.500 --> 23:34.780
um

23:34.780 --> 23:37.500
And so he was interested. He knows nothing about technology

23:38.220 --> 23:41.740
So he was very interested in this. He said val if you can actually deliver these things

23:41.820 --> 23:45.180
I know a thousand people that will spend a thousand dollars right now. I'm like, really?

23:45.980 --> 23:48.140
It's like, yeah, and like well, you can buy these online

23:48.700 --> 23:54.540
I mean, if it was that there's that much of an audience for it. I mean, you think there'd be something. I'm like hotcakes in july

23:55.420 --> 23:57.420
But they're not so

23:57.580 --> 23:59.580
Okay, so john porter

23:59.740 --> 24:05.980
Uh, you said john porter somehow introduced you to the lawyer, right the russian armenian lawyer

24:06.860 --> 24:09.100
No, yes, he introduced me to the lawyer. Yes

24:10.060 --> 24:12.060
Okay, and what's what's the lawyer's name?

24:12.540 --> 24:14.540
The lawyer's name is diana

24:15.420 --> 24:16.620
Uh

24:16.620 --> 24:18.620
with a really

24:18.620 --> 24:21.020
I don't I don't know her last name actually. I never asked

24:21.660 --> 24:27.980
But let me see but the because she says here in the text the first message I have from her is diana

24:28.700 --> 24:32.140
The second one is haids val and here's my number blah blah. So it was the introduction

24:32.700 --> 24:35.020
Text and she never put give me her last name, but I will ask

24:35.740 --> 24:37.740
john today for the last name

24:38.460 --> 24:40.540
That's her phone number I guess

24:41.420 --> 24:46.380
Um, again, I'm getting the same bullshit phone number. I'm getting a 310 400 4000

24:48.380 --> 24:50.700
Okay, yeah, it's a fake number

24:51.660 --> 24:59.020
She's somewhat of a prodigy. She was she skipped ahead and she went to college at usc at age 16

24:59.740 --> 25:03.500
And in ninth grade they skipped her up a few classes three grades

25:04.220 --> 25:06.860
And she was uh, she's a prodigy of some sort

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
Very

25:10.780 --> 25:12.780
She's 31

25:12.780 --> 25:15.900
Uh, that's another interesting thing. She was it was all international

25:16.700 --> 25:22.140
Uh, kind of you know, when you're spying, what do you do? What are those courses called international?

25:23.100 --> 25:24.700
communication is

25:24.700 --> 25:26.700
You know the one every

25:28.380 --> 25:33.100
No, no, I'm not I'm just saying that what I heard from her when we went to the meeting

25:33.180 --> 25:35.180
She told us a bit of her about her life story

25:35.420 --> 25:39.420
And um, it was actually john that brought up the she jumped ahead

25:40.140 --> 25:45.660
She's a prodigy and then she's filled it in by saying that she studied international communication international relations. Thank you

25:45.820 --> 25:48.060
And I'm the one that said, oh, that's what you know

25:48.300 --> 25:51.180
All the ciave guys study first and she could laugh and he was haha

25:51.500 --> 25:56.140
And she's actually I was approached by them and they wrote me a letter and I said, oh, can I see it?

25:56.140 --> 25:58.140
And she did not show me the letter

25:58.860 --> 26:03.820
Um asking me to work for them, but I said my real love was with the fbi. I really wanted to work with the fbi

26:03.900 --> 26:08.140
I said, oh, that's interesting. And she said, yeah, but um, you know, I just went into law

26:08.220 --> 26:11.180
Any because it was easier or something like I don't know. It's a weird story

26:11.900 --> 26:12.940
so

26:12.940 --> 26:15.020
Um, anyway, you asked I told you

26:16.460 --> 26:18.460
That's all I I don't have a last name

26:19.260 --> 26:21.660
But I haven't uh, she's 31 last thing

26:22.540 --> 26:24.780
31 years old went to usc number

26:25.500 --> 26:27.500
310400 4000

26:27.660 --> 26:28.860
Yeah

26:28.860 --> 26:30.860
introduces you to

26:31.420 --> 26:33.020
uh, arm and

26:33.020 --> 26:35.020
Pribolian

26:35.020 --> 26:40.060
Incorrect incorrect asks if I can help um ask if I can help her

26:41.260 --> 26:43.260
um

26:43.420 --> 26:47.660
But I don't can't tell you too much. I don't want to tell you too much here because I don't want to get you in trouble

26:48.860 --> 26:55.020
So I was asked to help on a totally different thing because I believe this guy has some compromising

26:55.660 --> 26:56.860
videos

26:56.860 --> 27:00.380
of her, uh, you know doing uh things that people do

27:01.260 --> 27:02.060
um

27:02.060 --> 27:06.300
And uh, her boy has compromising videos of diana. Yeah

27:07.180 --> 27:09.180
okay

27:09.260 --> 27:11.260
Okay, let's them deleted

27:12.780 --> 27:14.620
Okay

27:14.620 --> 27:15.420
so

27:15.420 --> 27:17.420
her boy in

27:17.420 --> 27:19.420
I forget how to spell the crc

27:20.460 --> 27:22.460
Oh

27:22.620 --> 27:29.740
Her boy has compromising videos of diana, but isn't her boy in being represented by diana or something like that

27:30.700 --> 27:33.180
Well, it's apparently they fuck

27:33.900 --> 27:35.900
Okay

27:46.700 --> 27:52.380
I don't know. I haven't seen it yet, but I think it's them. Maybe there's someone else. I don't know but uh, okay

27:52.860 --> 27:54.380
Yeah, so

27:54.380 --> 27:57.180
But then she wants them to delete it. So she called you

27:57.820 --> 28:01.660
No, no, she's not calling me. She's not calling me. No, I was introduced

28:02.220 --> 28:08.380
For by porter because porter. Yeah, we went to meet him in a park where he was working a different case

28:09.100 --> 28:11.100
He was protecting these this

28:12.140 --> 28:14.860
Uh, a woman and her children in the park

28:15.420 --> 28:17.420
um, some sort of gang thing

28:18.220 --> 28:22.220
So it was a whole thing and then he said, you know what you guys why don't you come and have lunch with me

28:22.540 --> 28:26.060
And my friend and you should really get know her because she's someone you should know, you know

28:26.140 --> 28:29.100
And this is called networking. It's like, oh, thanks john. He's a funny guy

28:29.420 --> 28:34.700
And you know, she's a criminal defense lawyer and she's very interested in these chords that you were telling me about

28:34.860 --> 28:36.220
I said, oh, okay

28:36.220 --> 28:39.580
So marie and I go over there for lunch and she does not cook lunch

28:39.980 --> 28:42.620
But she did give us coffee, but we were there for hours talking

28:43.420 --> 28:49.020
And she was very interested in financing these chords, but I have to deliver a working chord very soon

28:49.660 --> 28:52.380
And uh, then she told me what she wanted from me

28:53.340 --> 28:54.380
I said

28:54.380 --> 28:56.380
Right

28:58.460 --> 29:00.860
Okay, which is to delete these

29:01.420 --> 29:05.100
But uh, of her that kreboyan has videos. Yeah

29:08.540 --> 29:10.540
Okay, and

29:10.540 --> 29:12.540
So kreboyan is

29:12.620 --> 29:16.700
But she and she says he's an fsb officer. She alluded to that

29:17.500 --> 29:21.660
Yes, she did not again. I told you earlier. She did not come out and say fsb officer

29:22.460 --> 29:24.460
How did she

29:25.340 --> 29:27.340
Um, because I asked

29:28.060 --> 29:33.340
Um, when we spoke about because everything she said, um with the 16 phone calls

29:33.980 --> 29:36.220
And i'm looking at everything. Oh, she's just your basic

29:37.180 --> 29:39.980
Criminal defense attorney defending drug dealers, right?

29:40.700 --> 29:46.060
But then the guys said she says that he doesn't use drugs and doesn't doesn't uh, he's not a drug dealer

29:46.620 --> 29:51.420
And then I'm like, well, why would he have 16 phones? I said, oh and I just sort of sometimes I can't really control what I say

29:51.660 --> 29:54.300
Like a Tourette's but I don't have Tourette's and I said, oh fsb

29:55.100 --> 29:58.780
And then everyone sort of laughs and suddenly I was like, who's what's fsb?

29:58.860 --> 30:01.900
Because he's a little too old to understand that they changed kgb to fsb

30:02.620 --> 30:08.460
And then I'm like, oh, uh, and I started then she starts explaining, you know, she fills in my senses and then

30:09.180 --> 30:11.180
Uh, she said something

30:12.860 --> 30:14.860
That made it sort of click

30:14.940 --> 30:16.940
With me that it was fsb

30:17.100 --> 30:21.020
And it was something that she so there's a hacker named ruslan, you know ruslan

30:22.140 --> 30:24.940
How do you spell ruslan are you slan?

30:26.940 --> 30:28.060

30:28.060 --> 30:29.580
Oh, man

30:29.580 --> 30:33.980
Yeah, you are you're a bit out there about touch buddy. Sorry, but this guy ruslan

30:34.700 --> 30:36.700
You want me to make up man like every time

30:37.260 --> 30:42.140
I can't know everything in the fun. I'm busting your balls. Relax. I'm busting your balls, man

30:42.220 --> 30:45.500

Ah, dude, I'm busting your balls. Relax. Relax. You don't have a partner to bust balls with it's fun

30:51.260 --> 30:56.380
Yes, look, you got this guy ruslan. He's a russian hacker and he's a pretty fucking good by the way

30:56.380 --> 31:00.060
He's one of the best and he uh, I don't know exactly

31:00.620 --> 31:05.900
I'll fan but if I get my computer pull it off. He was working. She was handling his case

31:06.940 --> 31:08.780
and uh

31:08.780 --> 31:10.140
Shit, where's my computer here?

31:10.140 --> 31:13.580
If she was handling his case and she was working out a deal over he was going to hand himself

31:14.380 --> 31:16.380
over to the fbi

31:16.380 --> 31:19.740
And because this is your specialty. So that's what I'm telling you

31:20.700 --> 31:22.700
and at the very last day

31:23.420 --> 31:28.540
Uh, he's supposed to show up to court and turn himself in and get some sort of uh suspended sentence or something

31:29.020 --> 31:30.460
some sort of deal

31:30.460 --> 31:34.700
He got on it was well, we don't she didn't say for sure

31:34.780 --> 31:39.260
It was a plane but he left the country and went to Kiev on that very same day

31:39.900 --> 31:43.660
And everyone went to court and we're waiting for him for a while a long time

31:44.540 --> 31:48.220
When he uh, I think called from a some either a plane or a boat or something

31:48.460 --> 31:50.460
Somehow somehow he got to the Ukraine

31:51.180 --> 31:53.180
Is it his greatest career?
