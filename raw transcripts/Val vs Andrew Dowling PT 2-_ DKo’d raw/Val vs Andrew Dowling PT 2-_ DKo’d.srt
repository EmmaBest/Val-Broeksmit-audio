1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Say that again, but say again you you you I sorry I got right this down now because now you lost me

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,480
Hold on. Let me get a pen. Oh

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
There's the band-aids

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
By the way, that's an old check of mine

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,040
Make people feel more comfortable when I say oh

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,520
Hold on. Let me just get a pen and piece of paper so I can write this down

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,640
So that way you don't think that I'm recording you

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,240
All right, what do I say what do I say? I did I actually do have a pen and paper now you said ask him what?

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,800
So I initially asked him like why can't you proactively take

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,800
Information, okay, why can't you proactively pro is proactive of a hyphen?

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,000
Proactively no retain retain information from me

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,080
Okay, I'll obtain obtain. Oh not retain

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, you can retain it. No, you can retain anything

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,420
You know a nearly you can retain a lot in a retentive information

15
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,420
Why can't you anyway proactively you figure out how you want to phrase that okay?

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,260
We and then if you tap the answers and doesn't give you a direct answer, okay?

17
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,220
ask him if

18
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,700
The information that he could receive from you

19
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,820
Have privileged information which tainted him off a case. Oh

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,860
Okay, so any info he received for me could contain may contain

21
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
Privileged information

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
That would take him off the case

23
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,500
Yeah, and then if he doesn't answer there say

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,620
Did information that you provided get him in trouble or did he just get himself in trouble on

25
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,860
the rush of stuff

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,860
Like

27
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,180
Like

28
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,700
Is it something that it's specific to you where like if you go and you give information to David

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,180
Is that obstruction gonna go to David or is that just sticking with Tim?

30
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,820
Because he misbehaved himself and fucked up somewhere along. Oh, no Tim is saying if I give data to him to not to not to

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,260
Co but to him it would be obstruction or if he asked asked me

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,940
Yeah, and I think that was by trusting me because the next thing everything's on the New York Times

33
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,740
Right, yeah, but David Co is calling me back right now. Hold on. Let me turn on the word

34
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,260
Let me call you right back. Okay

35
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Hello

36
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,380
David, what's up? What happened?

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,620
Well, I told you I had a meeting. Okay. I thought you were hanging up already

38
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,380
Now, sorry. Okay. Good. I told you when remember when I first called you I said hey

39
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,380
I gotta go to meeting in five minutes and then 15 minutes later. I said, okay. I gotta go to the meeting

40
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,740
Hey, what did I say? I'm like, dude, I told you I had to go to the meeting. What are you?

41
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,540
Sorry, I missed that five minutes thing. I didn't hear that one. Sorry. I just maybe the phone died

42
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,940
But uh, okay. Sorry. So what do you think?

43
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,580
Um, like I said the stuff with Rick Cohen and Kurt Weldon, I mean

44
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,540
I mean, I'll add the Kurt Weldon stuff in see if that interests anyone. Um, I can get you a dossier

45
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,460
like a

46
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,260
Dossier like I'm sort of a so you understand it

47
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,740
Andrew, I think would be happy to provide one or maybe he's already got one like an outline of the basic gist of the whole story

48
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,260
And the players yeah, and the names and players involved

49
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,700
Okay, I'll do that. Let me write that down. Actually, hold on

50
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:22,300
Because otherwise I am gonna forget this. Okay, so uh dossier on Weldon and Russian thing

51
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,620
But that's separate from fsb guy in la so it's two

52
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,860
Okay

53
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,260
Did you do you text me the fsb guy's name yet or I have not no

54
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Oh, I'm still writing this down dossier and Weldon

55
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,860
Okay, um

56
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,820
You know what could we use signal from now on or I mean are you that secure with your with your iMessages?

57
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:54,060
I mean, well, I don't have signal when we can install signal on our work phone. I mean, I just buy a drop phone and use it

58
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:00,540
But are you worried about people like hacking in and stealing stuff? Yeah, you know, it's pretty

59
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,700
It

60
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,860
I mean if I can do it be someone else will do it to me, you know, so I'm pretty sure people

61
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,220
Uh, just iMessage. I don't know. I mean, it's encrypted end to end. So I don't know why maybe I'm just being

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,380
A paranoid, but let me just check my text. So I I'll have it right here

63
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,620
It's better to tell it to you than to text it is what I mean

64
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
For that in-lessons signal

65
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Um, we think this woman's number

66
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,460

00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,260
Try this. This is the other one. I think this is a fake. Um

87
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,180
This is an internet number though because it has a it's the eight seven zero

88
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,100
eight zero zero eight zero eight zero

89
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,260
Oh, yeah, yeah d o b, uh

90
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,460
January 13th 1983 first name arman a r m a n

91
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:31,980
Okay, so what is our fsp officer up to? Yes. Why is he in la? And why is he uh,

92
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Why is he so close to me now?

93
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
And am I being paranoid

94
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,040
Because this woman she came into my life very strangely I hired a private investigator

95
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,340
And the private investigator, uh, really good guy worked under the police force for a long time

96
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,100
I might have told you this already

97
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:59,340
30 years on the force and then deputy sheriff and then he was a detective for many of those years and

98
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,940
Um instead of going to politics and becoming a sheriff he went became p. I and he's a very renowned well-known p. I

99
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
He's introduced me to her

100
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,300
And said that she's very interested in these little cords. I have these things

101
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,020
I kind of

102
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,460
I don't make them, but I sort of have like a it's like a hobby. You know the omg cords

103
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,620
I can't say I do oh come on. You're a hacker. I thought you're a hacker

104
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,020
omg card code no cord omg

105
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,940
Oh, uh, so a guy named is a really good hacker named mg

106
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,260
Um, you developed a really good demon seed is this sort of company he goes by demon seed

107
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,540
and he uh great really good with encryption actually that's how I got to know him in 2016 I I heard is uh

108
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,700
um

109
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,420
He gave like a lecture on his encryption. They was developing for he's trying to get people into it

110
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,740
But he was pretty good. It was like a signal before signal or around the same time signal. What's going on?

111
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,780
but was he was really good at making these sort of

112
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,700
So what do you call him like a usb killers or usb hacks?

113
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,780
So if someone comes over hey, David, can I can I use your uh charger to charge up my iphone?

114
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,220
And you're like, oh, yeah, here you go and you give him one of the chargers the cords

115
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,540
And he plugs it in and the cord just sort of uh

116
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,060
It does a um, it doesn't acquisition

117
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,780
Immediately of all the data on your phone. Well, not all the data, but the high-value data

118
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,980
Important stuff and the best part about about it is that it's it's a web server

119
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,900
So you can log in to the damn cord and you can deliver payloads. You can do whatever, you know

120
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,180
There's a usb cable that will automatically dump an entire phone. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool, huh?

121
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,220
It's actually well, it's interesting. I

122
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Based on what I

123
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
know of most phones

124
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,060
I would say that the claim sounds a little bit excessive. I mean, there's some stuff you can

125
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,540
Well, I'll tell you what come over come over to my house and charge your phone and I'll show you

126
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,180
It's a I know it's a joke. I'm saying I'll show you that I'll show you I'll do it

127
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,420
I'll show you a thing for it, but I have to

128
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,460
I have

129
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,420
Yes, yes, it's called uh because oh mg is the the guy's name and he just put it o in front of it

130
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
So it's like, oh my god, you know omg

131
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,780
Yeah, but I have to tweak it because the way it's sort of sold

132
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,220
Honestly, it's there's some like, uh, it's a little like a miss uh miss not miss no

133
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,420
It's a miss uh

134
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,860
It's bad advertising because it sort of alludes to the fact that it will dump the whole fucking thing from the phone

135
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,820
But really when you get it and you're like, what is this you unbox it? It's really the opposite. It's for the computer

136
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,780
So, uh, but I looked it's a little different than a phone. That's what I'm saying

137
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,500
Yeah, I know the claim that you can just plug a phone in and it'll dump everything

138
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,460
But that's where I went there something I really I'm like, I really got a loot which

139
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,780
Is possible

140
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,740
I would I'll be very suspicious if it actually worked. Well, that's what I'm telling you. That's where I come in

141
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,140
And I did my a little tweak on it. So I make it work like it's supposed to work

142
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,220
Look, I thought it was going to work

143
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,180
And it's not as hard as you think because uh one you always do is get by the passcode and remember

144
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,660
These are for max mostly and for iphone's

145
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,580
So the passcode once you can get past that it's easy because you just trick it into thinking it's an iphone

146
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,260
It's not that hard. It's if it thinks if it thinks it's itunes passcode, but sorry

147
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,780
Again, like that's what I mean is like there's there's a lot of other steps that need to happen

148
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,660
Like the passcode is the very first hurdle you have to right get past exactly

149
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,140
Well, you what what idiot is gonna put their passcode in after they plug it into

150
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,540
No, no, no, no

151
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,700
Of course, but no, no what the thing is you nowadays you have to hit trust this computer or trust this phone, right?

152
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,820
right

153
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,900
So if you can already if the if the if you can emulate emulate the itunes software

154
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:23,580
Okay, which is just itunes and it's already pretty public you can find that that it's you emulate that and so the

155
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,660
Computer believes that you've already accepted this handshake. This handshake has been

156
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,380
Stored in somewhere in a cookie somewhere in there or a token or whatever the fuck it sees they do

157
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,180
It's actually a token

158
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,220
Then it's then it's okay, then you can get bypass the passcode, you know

159
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,860
And what you can get from another payload called lock scream

160
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,900
But somebody developed a while ago is very good

161
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,140
Is you can get the actual passcode so it'll it'll give you the passcode it gets into that little

162
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,660
You know, what's that thing every iphone has it's like a it's like a it's just a little file. I can't remember name

163
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,740
Yeah, I think you're gonna go lock file. So you just basically gets a lock file

164
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,460
Which is why it's called lock scream, you know

165
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:15,100
And so you incorporate that is payload number one and then the second one you get the credentials with the

166
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,900
You know, what's beautiful is I don't have to write anything. You just copy paste other people's scripts. So

167
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
And there's 12 different

168
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Slots and banks for payloads

169
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
It's really quite a cool thing

170
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,540
So anyway, I'm trying to I told this to my private investigator

171
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,140
He's like really I said, yeah, he's like, okay value. You know what I got I'll tell you what I'll do

172
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,340
I'm gonna work for you guys and you don't have to pay me. I just want a one painting from Marie

173
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,540
You know, and I want you to hook me up with one of these chords and a phone

174
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,980
Uh, you know, you know the phones that what do you call them the you can I can with blue dirt via bluetooth

175
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,500
Or via the rfi d chip or both I put my phone next to yours and it pulls all the data

176
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
What do you call that?

177
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,540
Well, I mean to get that claim is also very

178
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Uh

179
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,420
I've heard and I've seen some stuff, but it's not as simple as like I put my phone next year and it feels everything

180
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,060
Well, you then you are buddy you're you are out of the loop because I have seen those and they are

181
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,580
Available and they do work and funny enough the only the last time I saw it was my friend Sydney

182
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,980
It was getting divorced and her husband had that had that phone and he uh,

183
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,660
He pulled all her data out and it was really quite amazing and that was in 2015

184
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,460
But at that time it took 30 minutes, so he had to leave

185
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,100
His phone on top of hers for 30 minutes

186
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,660
So that was the only problem was getting that to happen for 30 minutes

187
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,740
But nowadays you don't have to have it on top of the other phone. It can be within about one the six half a foot radius

188
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,620
So that's why I suspect rfi d is the new way it's going in not bluetooth

189
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,780
Because you know, that's the only you can bluetooth you can go you know pretty far, but rfi d you've got to be right there, you know

190
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,140
Still it's a lot of there's still a lot of data to pull over um that channel

191
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,740
I mean that handshake you can't handle much. That's why they only send out like a couple numbers

192
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,780
You know, it's like call and response with something and then decrypt it on rfi d

193
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,460
So that's why you can only get the numbers and you can get um the messages are too big

194
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,380
You're not getting the full dump for the phone. Well, you're getting call on the desk or maybe messages or something

195
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,980
Well, no, no, that's the thing at first you're not getting the full dump, but then you can turn on the bluetooth

196
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,460
Okay, and from the bluetooth you'll get the full dump

197
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,020
So the malware will will do will have a two-step basically two prong attack

198
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,620
How does it uh download the malware onto the victim phone from the bluetooth connection

199
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,940
But how does it initiate a bluetooth connection without a handshake?

200
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,980
Well, it's remember how you it's you know how like a vpn won't let you turn off the wi-fi

201
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,260
There's a little trick in in apple that just has that stupid

202
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:07,660
Some there's the bluetooth the vpn people figured out first. It's a little hack. It's not even a hack. It's just built into the code

203
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,220
um, so if you have a

204
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,820
Every time the user turns it off it goes the root turns it back on

205
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,540
So and you can do that for the for that toggle that button which means you can do it for every other toggle button

206
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,100
Wait, so

207
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,300
How does so there's a signal that sends to the victim phone?

208
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,620
Victim phone

209
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:36,300
Then accepts this bluetooth connection without validation. No. No. No. No the the signal the signal is sent through rfid chat

210
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
or for the rfid frequency

211
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,100
um, and there's a second frequency which is not rfid, but it's like ic or is uh our

212
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,020
There's a third one in there too. That's involved and those two

213
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
Uh

214
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,140
Shit, it's it's the credit card. What do credit cards use again?

215
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,700
Yes, nfc. You're right. nfc rfid and fc

216
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,500
So I think it's nfc that does the initial handshake. Sorry

217
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,300
Then rfid and then bluetooth

218
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,940
But at the end of the day it's always bluetooth that pulls the data because that is the fastest way to do it

219
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,460
And the way it tricks the into the authentication

220
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,980
Is that it deoths first everything around it and then reoff on the uh

221
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,940
On the up on the reoff. There's somehow is uh, I don't I'm not sure exactly

222
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,260
I'm like, I'm not a coder, but I can take a look at it and see what it is, but I don't know

223
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,220
Like that's where I can tell you I don't know but it just does it

224
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,100
And I think it has to do with the root if you if you can root it

225
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
um, you can

226
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Via bluetooth

227
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
Because uh, ios

228
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Yeah, no

229
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,500
Dude you got to get in the field more man. I'm telling you, sydney would never use anything but an iphone

230
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
She's one of those people, you know

231
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,940
Um, since whatever whatever iphone's became a status symbol

232
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,780
She's she's one of those in the in the husband is a billionaire. So he has no

233
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,820
He has unlimited access to rnd

234
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Okay, so remember that too. Yeah

235
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
I don't anyway, I don't know whatever

236
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
The reason I say that is because um

237
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,900
With unlimited access you can hire a team of hackers to do this for you

238
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,100
But he didn't need to do that you can you can buy one you realize that I I do pen testing like I

239
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,700
Whatever it doesn't no, no. I'm not tell me you do pen testing

240
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,420
But whatever it is. Tell me it's not it's not worth like trying to figure out like how this has worked

241
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,580
I'd like to know. No, I like the questions because you're making me think it's good

242
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,620
Usually I just do stuff by instinct and then

243
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Yeah, whatever man, what

244
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,300
What i'm saying is like I think the claim that you're making might be conflated with other data that might also be present

245
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,780
There might be a lot of other things that also have to happen

246
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,380
In order for this thing to work. Well, he's not gonna look. We're not getting we're not getting photos. That's not happening

247
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,020
All right, we're not getting photos and videos. We're getting messages

248
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,900
You get a full full everything on the phone. That's a clone. That's a lot. That's different a lot of information

249
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:21,980
Sorry, I misspoke. I misspoke. That's a that's a clone like a complete clone the reason why I know that that's not true

250
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,340
Is because just based on data throughput alone

251
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,100
Like you say you have a regular iPhone that's like 64 gigs

252
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,780
You know like 64 gigs with the data just transfer that data alone

253
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Not via either type wirelessly

254
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,140
I mean at best at best you're gonna get like 10 15 megabytes per second

255
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,580
And that's if you're like burning through it and you're like phone to phone

256
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,700
10 to 15 megabytes per second think about that it takes forever to get 64 gigs

257
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,180
So if you thought that someone's just gonna like

258
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,380
Oh

259
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,740
And I'm gonna grab everything that's what I mean. It's like yeah, what if it's the wi-fi that's almost impossible

260
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,660
It must be the wi-fi

261
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,660
No, it's not it would be the wi-fi because if you can turn on the wi-fi and hotspot

262
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,420
Hotspot the phone. Yeah, but like the phone can't

263
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,020
A phone doesn't have the native ability to transfer something wi-fi to wi-fi right like

264
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,220
Think if you have that you have an iPhone right how many ways can you transfer data?

265
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,500
You can airdrop it you can bluetooth it which is the same thing

266
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,740
You can transfer via wi-fi, but it has to have a specific protocol that allows it to transfer that data. So like

267
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,460
Anyway, no, no

268
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,620
But that's what I'm saying. It's like when you make this claim like oh, I have enough to hold on like

269
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,860
No, no, but it verifies if you what you just said was the missing the link

270
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,060
Because it just it verifies what I was telling you before it is

271
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,700
It has to be bluetooth because it is the airdrop the airdrop is the fastest way to do it

272
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,780
It's actually faster than wi-fi close differences

273
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,340
That's gotta be it airdropping something also has a bunch of other security protocols that hey, if someone's cracked it

274
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,020
Maybe they have I mean there's always new things every day that I know I learned about

275
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
But it seems

276
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,740
Here's the other thing is we get a lot of these claims and then we go look at it and it's fucking bullshit

277
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
And then total bullshit where some

278
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,420
Is just scamming other pretend hackers. I'm not telling you something I heard from somebody. This isn't like a

279
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,340
Gossipy thing. I'm telling you something that I that I've seen and I know

280
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,180
You know, maybe I got scammed. Maybe someone pulled the wool over from my eyes or something

281
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,980
They use some other, you know, it's a good parlor trick. It's possible

282
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,820
But I don't I don't know. I'll just I look into it. I mean I will look at

283
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Here's the other thing too is like

284
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,700
Like I am interested in this stuff and the reason is because you know, we need to keep abreast of like what's the latest hack

285
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,980
What's the latest vulnerability and it's always changing but

286
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,500
You're realistically like this type of information

287
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,660
If from an investigative standpoint is invaluable to us unless someone's using it to do something bad something illegal

288
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,700
Like breaking into someone's phone is already illegal

289
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,500
But you know, it's like if a proof of concept is you're just like a white hacker

290
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,580
You're trying to find vulnerabilities. Yeah, they do it all the time. They publish white papers and

291
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,340
You know, we read them and we go to you know, trainings on them and things like that

292
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,580
But there's nothing illegal about that, right? So it's right while it's interesting. It's not

293
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,540
It's only illegal if you use it

294
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,300
And by the way, I'm just this is a side adage for the main story I was telling you

295
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,820
We just got stuck here because it's fun to talk shop for some for once in a while

296
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,940
But yeah, the main gist is that they wanted they they were interested in developing these things as a mass production kind of thing

297
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,420
so, um, I got called into this meeting and uh

298
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:40,060
And the lawyer was there. She wants to uh, either fund it. I wasn't quite sure what she wanted

299
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Other than

300
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,100
Um, yeah, why he's a good guy. Okay. Yeah porter p o r t e r

301
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:58,700
Order that last name. Yes, uh, uh, john. I don't know if it's an h or an n. I think it's I think it's john with an h

302
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
But he's a he's a good dude

303
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,020
Yeah, he has he owned a uh, he was sorry. He's the the warden

304
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,300
He was the warden of a of a prison out here

305
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,700
After that for a while too. No, he's an interesting guy. Very clever

306
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,940
He's a former bluthangeles county sheriff's officer

307
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,060
Bakersfield Bakersfield deputy deputy sheriff

308
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,940
And there was a time when there was constables in california. Is that correct? There's a constable

309
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,540
And so back then he used to work in the constables office or something. I'm not exactly sure. I'll ask him. He's coming by today

310
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,780
um

311
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,500
And so he was interested. He knows nothing about technology

312
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,740
So he was very interested in this. He said val if you can actually deliver these things

313
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,180
I know a thousand people that will spend a thousand dollars right now. I'm like, really?

314
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,140
It's like, yeah, and like well, you can buy these online

315
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,540
I mean, if it was that there's that much of an audience for it. I mean, you think there'd be something. I'm like hotcakes in july

316
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,420
But they're not so

317
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,580
Okay, so john porter

318
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,980
Uh, you said john porter somehow introduced you to the lawyer, right the russian armenian lawyer

319
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,100
No, yes, he introduced me to the lawyer. Yes

320
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Okay, and what's what's the lawyer's name?

321
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,540
The lawyer's name is diana

322
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,620
Uh

323
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
with a really

324
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,020
I don't I don't know her last name actually. I never asked

325
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,980
But let me see but the because she says here in the text the first message I have from her is diana

326
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,140
The second one is haids val and here's my number blah blah. So it was the introduction

327
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,020
Text and she never put give me her last name, but I will ask

328
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
john today for the last name

329
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,540
That's her phone number I guess

330
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,380
Um, again, I'm getting the same bullshit phone number. I'm getting a 310 400 4000

331
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,700
Okay, yeah, it's a fake number

332
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:59,020
She's somewhat of a prodigy. She was she skipped ahead and she went to college at usc at age 16

333
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,500
And in ninth grade they skipped her up a few classes three grades

334
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,860
And she was uh, she's a prodigy of some sort

335
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Very

336
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
She's 31

337
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,900
Uh, that's another interesting thing. She was it was all international

338
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,140
Uh, kind of you know, when you're spying, what do you do? What are those courses called international?

339
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,700
communication is

340
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
You know the one every

341
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,100
No, no, I'm not I'm just saying that what I heard from her when we went to the meeting

342
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,180
She told us a bit of her about her life story

343
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,420
And um, it was actually john that brought up the she jumped ahead

344
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,660
She's a prodigy and then she's filled it in by saying that she studied international communication international relations. Thank you

345
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,060
And I'm the one that said, oh, that's what you know

346
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,180
All the ciave guys study first and she could laugh and he was haha

347
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,140
And she's actually I was approached by them and they wrote me a letter and I said, oh, can I see it?

348
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
And she did not show me the letter

349
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,820
Um asking me to work for them, but I said my real love was with the fbi. I really wanted to work with the fbi

350
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,140
I said, oh, that's interesting. And she said, yeah, but um, you know, I just went into law

351
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,180
Any because it was easier or something like I don't know. It's a weird story

352
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,940
so

353
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,020
Um, anyway, you asked I told you

354
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
That's all I I don't have a last name

355
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,660
But I haven't uh, she's 31 last thing

356
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,780
31 years old went to usc number

357
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500

358
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,860
Yeah

00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,020
uh, arm and

361

Pribolian

362
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:40,060
Incorrect incorrect asks if I can help um ask if I can help her

363
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
um

364
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,660
But I don't can't tell you too much. I don't want to tell you too much here because I don't want to get you in trouble

365
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:55,020
So I was asked to help on a totally different thing because I believe this guy has some compromising

366
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,860
videos

367
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,380
of her, uh, you know doing uh things that people do

368
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,060
um

369
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,300
And uh, her boy has compromising videos of diana. Yeah

370
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,180

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,260
Okay, let's them deleted

372
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,620
Okay

373
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,420
so

374
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
her boy in

375
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
I forget how to spell the crc

376
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Oh

377
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,740
Her boy has compromising videos of diana, but isn't her boy in being represented by diana or something like that

378
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,180
Well, it's apparently they fuck

379
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Okay

380
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,380
I don't know. I haven't seen it yet, but I think it's them. Maybe there's someone else. I don't know but uh, okay

381
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,380
Yeah, so

382
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,180
But then she wants them to delete it. So she called you

383
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,660
No, no, she's not calling me. She's not calling me. No, I was introduced

384
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,380
For by porter because porter. Yeah, we went to meet him in a park where he was working a different case

385
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
He was protecting these this

386
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,860
Uh, a woman and her children in the park

387
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,420
um, some sort of gang thing

388
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,220
So it was a whole thing and then he said, you know what you guys why don't you come and have lunch with me

389
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,060
And my friend and you should really get know her because she's someone you should know, you know

390
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,100
And this is called networking. It's like, oh, thanks john. He's a funny guy

391
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,700
And you know, she's a criminal defense lawyer and she's very interested in these chords that you were telling me about

392
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,220
I said, oh, okay

393
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,580
So marie and I go over there for lunch and she does not cook lunch

394
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,620
But she did give us coffee, but we were there for hours talking

395
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:49,020
And she was very interested in financing these chords, but I have to deliver a working chord very soon

396
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,380
And uh, then she told me what she wanted from me

397
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,380
I said

398
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Right

399
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,860
Okay, which is to delete these

400
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,100
But uh, of her that kreboyan has videos. Yeah

401
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Okay, and

402
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,540
So kreboyan is

403
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,700
But she and she says he's an fsb officer. She alluded to that

404
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,660
Yes, she did not again. I told you earlier. She did not come out and say fsb officer

405
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,460
How did she

406
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Um, because I asked

407
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,340
Um, when we spoke about because everything she said, um with the 16 phone calls

408
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,220
And i'm looking at everything. Oh, she's just your basic

409
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,980
Criminal defense attorney defending drug dealers, right?

410
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,060
But then the guys said she says that he doesn't use drugs and doesn't doesn't uh, he's not a drug dealer

411
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,420
And then I'm like, well, why would he have 16 phones? I said, oh and I just sort of sometimes I can't really control what I say

412
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,300
Like a Tourette's but I don't have Tourette's and I said, oh fsb

413
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,780
And then everyone sort of laughs and suddenly I was like, who's what's fsb?

414
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,900
Because he's a little too old to understand that they changed kgb to fsb

415
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,460
And then I'm like, oh, uh, and I started then she starts explaining, you know, she fills in my senses and then

416
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Uh, she said something

417
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
That made it sort of click

418
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,940
With me that it was fsb

419
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,020
And it was something that she so there's a hacker named ruslan, you know ruslan

420
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,940
How do you spell ruslan are you slan?

421
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,060

422
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,580
Oh, man

00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,980
Yeah, you are you're a bit out there about touch buddy. Sorry, but this guy ruslan

424
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
You want me to make up man like every time

428
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,380
Yes, look, you got this guy ruslan. He's a russian hacker and he's a pretty fucking good by the way

429
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,060
He's one of the best and he uh, I don't know exactly

430
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,900
I'll fan but if I get my computer pull it off. He was working. She was handling his case

431
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,780
and uh

432
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,140
Shit, where's my computer here?

433
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,580
If she was handling his case and she was working out a deal over he was going to hand himself

434
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
over to the fbi

435
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,740
And because this is your specialty. So that's what I'm telling you

436
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
and at the very last day

437
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,540
Uh, he's supposed to show up to court and turn himself in and get some sort of uh suspended sentence or something

438
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,460
some sort of deal

439
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,700
He got on it was well, we don't she didn't say for sure

440
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,260
It was a plane but he left the country and went to Kiev on that very same day

441
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,660
And everyone went to court and we're waiting for him for a while a long time

442
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,220
When he uh, I think called from a some either a plane or a boat or something

443
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Somehow somehow he got to the Ukraine

444
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,180
Is it his greatest career?
