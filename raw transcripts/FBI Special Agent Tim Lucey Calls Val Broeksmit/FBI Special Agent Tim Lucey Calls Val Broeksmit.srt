5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,240

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,040

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,760

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,320
to divide and conquer yeah I mean we're drowning yeah and you've been doing

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,040

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,440
have been on top of them or more I apologize one other thing that I mean

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,280
now that now that the cat's out of the hat and that he sent that report the

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,760
other thing I did mention to the gentleman was hey listen I was in their

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:52,080
house and I'm not at you know I'm not a an expert in you know in child services

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,720
I think but you know he appears to be loved he had a dedicated you know nice

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,600
child friendly living space I mean he has his bedroom up there yeah he loves it

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,840
man and I'm so thank you thank you how come that does not come through on here

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,600
how come they changed your words perverted and I don't know you said he

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,840
talked to a guy Sabah is a woman she says she's looking directly I spoke with

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:23,480
I spoke with a gentleman in the FBI or DCFS the DSF DCFS she says you know what

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,280
no I spoke I spoke to a gentleman but I think there was a woman conference in

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,200
but she didn't do any of the talking with the gentleman that did that most of

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,760
the talking so that's completely taken out of context your words I mean yeah I

32
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,960
think so and they certainly didn't say they were gonna generate a report and I

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,200
would have liked to have read the report she's a man I'll show if you want to

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll send it to you man it is outrageously bizarre yeah like our lawyer we

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
got a lawyer that's fucking expensive man for this and you look at this he's

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,560
done this 10,000 times at this district you've never seen anything like this I'll

37
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,360
say I will take from the limited experience I've had I mean in New York I've

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:12,160
made obviously I've made arrests and whatnot and the circumstances surrounding

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,320
in those situations were horrendous and nothing was done and in those

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:25,160
circumstances I've made referrals I called I called an agent out of Los

41
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,720
Angeles an agent out of Houston that I know that deals with this sort of stuff

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,200
and they asked if you would be okay if I forwarded you there forwarded them your

43
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,040
information they might be able to help okay all right one guy's name is one

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,160
guy's name is Kevin I need a pen hold on Marie by the way Marie is here and

David okay all right I'll do that now and then yeah I wanted to call you I

50
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,760
couldn't but and I do think some of that was taken out of context and I'd be

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,440
happy to you know how you could fix it you know what you do we need witness

52
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
statements so people that have been if that have seen Marie and I and Marla

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
together and just saying that we're normal good people you know from what I've

54
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,240
seen Marla is happy he's well-fed my god man this listen to buy there's a

55
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,080
bipolar woman living next door and Steve is the is will not let her divorce

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,440
Steve has been like doing I can't will do that getting into too much he's been

57
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,200
it like just obsessively trying to get me out of her life so he can keep her

58
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,240
after 10 years of being separate and trying to get it so he's using this

59
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,200
bipolar woman she says I have 50 cell phones okay she does I'm not even

60
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,160
making that up I'll send you her statement 50 cell phones Marlo is foraging

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,760
through the garbage in a barefoot and wearing only shorts to find food after

62
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,720
after midnight right says that Marie is also dumpster diving for furniture and

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,320
clothes what does it say what does it say it's crazy out there shit man and

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,520
these people at DCFS are so incompetent they can't see tell

65
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:31,680
when they're talking to a crazy bipolar woman yeah it escalates because Steve

66
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,760
feeds her and all this comes from Steve and two friends of Steve's that say

67
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,120
that we're drug addicts from 2018 18 right yeah see in France where is he

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Steve is here he won't go anywhere close to Marie he's from Australia but he's

69
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,880
still here in the police he's like 20 minutes away you cannot leave versus site

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
he hasn't had a girlfriend in 10 years like look the basic gist he had a

71
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,040
aneurysm in his back which left him paralyzed from the waist down in 2004 he

72
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,040
has a catheter to go to the bathroom he the guy has he can't no erection he has

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,200
not had sex in over 14 years right so that that will erode someone's brain and

74
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,660
Marie has seen it escalate lately so what she did during coronavirus because

75
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,320
he got so scary for her that she decided I'm not gonna give Marlo back for the

76
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,400
next three months so I'm gonna keep him now because they don't have a custody

77
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,720
arrangement so she kept him for the last five months yeah and she's scared a lot

78
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,000
of people around here but not to do you know good and that's good it's good to

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,720
hear because she was terrified what's gonna happen and this is his retaliation

80
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,560
calling DCFS four times in a row four times and they come in here and then at

81
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
first like if you read the report you'll see everything's great for the first 14

82
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
pages and all of a sudden we're the worst people in the world and there all

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,320
right but if you could write a witness statement Tim that would and that would

84
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,920
be a clincher that would be so fucking valuable and helpful for us from coming

85
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,680
from you especially all right yeah I don't think a problem with it I had to

86
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,680
bounce it off of my legal folks I mean it's already it's already my concern would

87
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
be disclosing our relationship but I think that's already out there I don't

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,400
think that I don't think it would be a huge issue okay let me also understand

89
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,960
your information to the to the agents out there right now and if you don't

90
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,200
hear from them in the next couple of days circle back to me we'll do all right

91
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,480
two days if I don't hear from them we'll circle back we would circle back David

92
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,960
Ho is the name we're sorry Mary would you say I mean if you don't want to talk

93
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,000
about your affairs and what you did with Val you can just say I can satisfy that

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
these people are not abusing the child yeah and they're not yeah our relationship

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,600
doesn't matter as much as what your your perception of our the relationship is

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:50,240
Marie and myself and Marlon yeah we're feeding him this food in the fridge he's
