1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello? Hello? Uh, hello?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, this is David.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Uh, hello? Oh, let me just turn this off. Hello?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Uh, David, uh, David Ho?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Uh, David Ho, yeah.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, Co, the K, sorry.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hold on, let me just turn this thing off.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay. Hi, how's it going?

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Uh, you're Tim's, uh, you're the FBI LA, right?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Right, right.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, cool. Great. Um, so did Tim tell you what was going on?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He just said that, uh, he has some issues.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And, um, we're like, we've done some stuff with other people.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Um, and it sounds like some of the same issues

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
with, um, child care and things like that.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah. Um, so anyway, I'm going to get a little bit more

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
information from you and see what we can do to help.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Sure. Sure, absolutely.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Uh, so David, are you, um, are you like an attorney

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
or with the FBI? What's your, what's your role?

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No, I'm an agent just like Tim is.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, a special agent. Okay. Cool.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you guys in the same, are you like, is there any difference

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or did I, you could tell me DC three?

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Uh, I'm sorry, say that one more time.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you in DC three?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So he's, he's out in New York and I'm, well, I'm actually

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
based out of another office, but, uh, I'm working with the FBI LA.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, um, I'll actually be in LA, um, actually on Tuesday,

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Tuesday night and then, um, are you the agent from Houston?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So what happened then?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So Tim told me he got a call from you.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I didn't know that you were the agent Houston till just now.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then you were interviewing him with a third party on the

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
line and what woman named Sabah Hapta.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know anything about that.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, wow. Okay.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's talking about something else.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He didn't tell me anything about who's Shabah Hapta.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Should I know what Shabah Hapta is?

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Uh, yeah, yeah. She's the evil DCS DCFS woman.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, okay.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I, I don't know who, so I know, I know there was some DCFS person.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I didn't realize that.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So Shabah Hapta is the DCFS agent.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sabah.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a, it's S-A-B-A-H-A.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's like hate, but with a B, H-A-B-T-E.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay. S-A-B-A-H-A-B-T-E.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's correct. Yeah.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She's with DCFS and she, um, well, look, I'll give you the quick version.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Um, my girlfriend Marie, which, um, uh, jam, you know, jammy, jammy tam?

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can't, can't say I do. Who's jammy tam?

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Uh, he's also agent out in New York, SDNY.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, that's right.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I, I've heard of the name. I actually have never talked to jammy.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I talked with Tim just once.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, okay. Well, they're both, they're all good people.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And Carmen, you probably, you probably don't know Carmen either.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But, you know, I've been working with them on, they told you what I've been doing, right?

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right. Some stuff in Deutsche Bank?

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes. There you go.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Deutsche Bank.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Uh-huh.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Just, you know, catching the bad guys basically.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Um, so, and they did a favor for me a while ago where, uh, Marie and her son, uh, Marlowe

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
are 18 years old. Um, they need to get there.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, see, Marie's going through this very contentious divorce.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Um, the ex-husband's not a good guy kind of divorce, you know.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And, uh, and, uh, so she needed to divorce him.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And she, the only way she could was to get off his visa.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Um, and he tried everything he could to not allow that to happen.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But fortunately jammy and Tim and Carmen made it happen.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So she, she got off his visa.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
She has her own visa with Marlowe on it.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Um, but, uh, now that divorce proceedings has started, have started, he has escalated

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
dramatically, dramatically so.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Um, including his escalation, now the short version is he's launched a full on attack

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
on myself as the boyfriend.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And Marie obviously is the, uh, is the ex-wife.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The kind of guy that would rather see the world burn than lose Marie's attention.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Does that make sense?

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You know the types?

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sure.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Unfortunately, I know a couple, but.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, I do.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I do.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's unfortunate, especially when, uh, especially here in this case, because there's an eight

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
year old, like he, the sort of person doesn't, uh, put the child first.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
His needs first.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then the child, right? Marlowe.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So I keep saying the child, like he's like, I'm just saying, but it's Marlowe.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He's an eight year old.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So it puts.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I mean, he's Marie's child.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No matter how old he is, he's always going to be Marie's child.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I get you.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Exactly.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know, but I, I come from, and my, my language has gotten colder as I've talked

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
with lawyers.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Cause now I say the child.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's, you know, it's very terrible.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But, um, anyway.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, uh, Marlowe, uh, in, uh, you had, you see his, his, he has a problem.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Um, not only has he gone, the reason he's gone mad is 11 years ago.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He had a spinal aneurysm, which left him paralyzed for about a year.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And Marie was married to him at the time and nursed him back to health.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He was able to walk again, but he did not regain all his functions.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So, uh, his bladder, his stomach, all this stuff.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He has to use a catheter, et cetera, et cetera.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Um, and of course the impotent, and that's one of the poor guys, you know, for 10 years

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
can't have sex or have a hard on.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So, uh, oh, Marie's here by the Marie.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is cat.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Mr. Ho.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Co.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
David Co.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hello.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you for calling on a Sunday night.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's okay.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's okay.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
She listens.

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sure.

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sure.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thanks.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Uh, so, um, 16 years.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Sorry.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
16 years, he says.

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And, uh, so when she, uh, they've been separated for a while because he would not allow a divorce.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Um, but his brain and like his body has deteriorated, but so is the brain.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I mean, if you can imagine 16 years without any, I guess, sexual release or, uh, friendship.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He hasn't had a girlfriend also in 16 years.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So you can, this is the type of person I'm telling you about.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you know this type, right?

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Not even a girlfriend.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So the obsession with Marie is very, very severe.

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And, um, uh, so Marlo and Marie's and I both noticed that is the deterioration has escalated

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
dramatically.

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So, so Marie took it upon herself to not, they've had a, not a shared custody agreement, but

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
since they're marrying, they've had a, um, verbal agreement where Marie pretty much has

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Marlo, I'd say 75 to 80% of the time and Steve sees him on the weekends.

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But at this point, Marie decided that she could not trust him alone with Marlo.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So she kept him when COVID started.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She said, I'm going to keep him.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I mean, I've got him for school and we can sit here and we can talk to him.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And cause he changed a little bit around February.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We still don't know why Marlo has.

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We don't know what's happened.

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So Marie kept him and that escalated things even further for the divorce proceedings.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Right.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So fast forward till very recent, about a month ago, uh, we have, we're not very well liked

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
in our, um, building area.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We live in the brewery artist lofts.

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's, you know, the brewery is.

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I've heard of it, uh, kind of a nice, uh, kind of artsy place.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Exactly.

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's, it's a lot.

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I know, I know.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't worry.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to explain.

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I say we're not well liked here because the building management has been fighting us for

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
some time because of, of another crazy incident.

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Um, but we have to talk.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You see, I don't want to bore David with all the details of that, but it's just a whole

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
another thing.

183
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So there's a woman here named Patille, uh, S-A-A-J-T-I-A-N and she lives two doors down.

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Now she recently moved into that, this flat and we didn't, we never heard of her.

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Sorry, but, uh, we thought she was harmless at first.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's like typical normal art.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, she's like a really bad artist.

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She makes crystal jewelry just to get to the point.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like no one wants to buy a crystal jewelry.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Um, but Marlowe, he's eight years old and he's very inquisitive.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He's very talkative.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And he was like, Oh my God, crystal jewelry.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And she, she met him in the park and she talked to him and, um, convinced him to become her

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
apprentice for crystal jewelry.

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And remember this is COVID.

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So everyone's living with each other for the last four months.

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So everyone's going crazy.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You know, it's, uh, what's the word?

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Uh, you know, Jack Nicholson, the shining sort of worldwide.

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Cabin fever.

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Cabin fever.

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Cabin fever in the whole country and probably the world because everyone's living together.

205
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So, uh, we figured, wow.

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
She's, she wants Marlowe to come to her place to do, to make crystal jewelry for two hours

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
of the day.

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And we're like, Oh, that's great idea for us.

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We can finally be alone for two hours.

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You know.

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So, and we, so Serrat, we think she's fairly sane.

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And, uh, Marie goes to introduce herself and we talk about a housekeeper.
