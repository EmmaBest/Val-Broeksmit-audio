[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Hello? Hello? Uh, hello?
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  No, this is David.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  Uh, hello? Oh, let me just turn this off. Hello?
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Uh, David, uh, David Ho?
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Uh, David Ho, yeah.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Oh, Co, the K, sorry.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  Hold on, let me just turn this thing off.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  Okay. Hi, how's it going?
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  Uh, you're Tim's, uh, you're the FBI LA, right?
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  Right, right.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  Okay, cool. Great. Um, so did Tim tell you what was going on?
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  He just said that, uh, he has some issues.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  And, um, we're like, we've done some stuff with other people.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  Um, and it sounds like some of the same issues
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  with, um, child care and things like that.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  Yeah. Um, so anyway, I'm going to get a little bit more
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  information from you and see what we can do to help.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Sure. Sure, absolutely.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  Uh, so David, are you, um, are you like an attorney
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  or with the FBI? What's your, what's your role?
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  No, I'm an agent just like Tim is.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  Oh, a special agent. Okay. Cool.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  Are you guys in the same, are you like, is there any difference
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  or did I, you could tell me DC three?
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Uh, I'm sorry, say that one more time.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Are you in DC three?
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  So he's, he's out in New York and I'm, well, I'm actually
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  based out of another office, but, uh, I'm working with the FBI LA.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  So, um, I'll actually be in LA, um, actually on Tuesday,
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  Tuesday night and then, um, are you the agent from Houston?
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.000]  So what happened then?
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  So Tim told me he got a call from you.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  I didn't know that you were the agent Houston till just now.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  And then you were interviewing him with a third party on the
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  line and what woman named Sabah Hapta.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  I don't know anything about that.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Oh, wow. Okay.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  He's talking about something else.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  He didn't tell me anything about who's Shabah Hapta.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  Should I know what Shabah Hapta is?
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  Uh, yeah, yeah. She's the evil DCS DCFS woman.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  Oh, okay.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  So I, I don't know who, so I know, I know there was some DCFS person.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  I didn't realize that.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  Okay.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  So Shabah Hapta is the DCFS agent.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  Yeah.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  Sabah.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  It's a, it's S-A-B-A-H-A.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  It's like hate, but with a B, H-A-B-T-E.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  Okay. S-A-B-A-H-A-B-T-E.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  That's correct. Yeah.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  She's with DCFS and she, um, well, look, I'll give you the quick version.
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  Um, my girlfriend Marie, which, um, uh, jam, you know, jammy, jammy tam?
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  I can't, can't say I do. Who's jammy tam?
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  Uh, he's also agent out in New York, SDNY.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  Oh, that's right.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Yeah.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  So I, I've heard of the name. I actually have never talked to jammy.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  I talked with Tim just once.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Oh, okay. Well, they're both, they're all good people.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  And Carmen, you probably, you probably don't know Carmen either.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  But, you know, I've been working with them on, they told you what I've been doing, right?
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  Right. Some stuff in Deutsche Bank?
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  Yes. There you go.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  Deutsche Bank.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  Uh-huh.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Just, you know, catching the bad guys basically.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  Um, so, and they did a favor for me a while ago where, uh, Marie and her son, uh, M-[Redacted]
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  are 18 years old. Um, they need to get there.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  Well, see, Marie's going through this very contentious divorce.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  Um, the ex-husband's not a good guy kind of divorce, you know.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  And, uh, and, uh, so she needed to divorce him.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  And she, the only way she could was to get off his visa.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Um, and he tried everything he could to not allow that to happen.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  But fortunately jammy and Tim and Carmen made it happen.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  So she, she got off his visa.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  She has her own visa with M-[Redacted] on it.
[03:43.000 --> 03:50.000]  Um, but, uh, now that divorce proceedings has started, have started, he has escalated
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  dramatically, dramatically so.
[03:52.000 --> 04:01.000]  Um, including his escalation, now the short version is he's launched a full on attack
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  on myself as the boyfriend.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  And Marie obviously is the, uh, is the ex-wife.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  The kind of guy that would rather see the world burn than lose Marie's attention.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  Does that make sense?
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  You know the types?
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  Sure.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  Okay.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Unfortunately, I know a couple, but.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  Yeah.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  Yeah, I do.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  I do.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's unfortunate, especially when, uh, especially here in this case, because there's an eight
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  year old, like he, the sort of person doesn't, uh, put the child first.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  His needs first.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  And then the child, right? M-[Redacted].
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  So I keep saying the child, like he's like, I'm just saying, but it's M-[Redacted].
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  He's an eight year old.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  So it puts.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  I mean, he's Marie's child.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  Yeah.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  No matter how old he is, he's always going to be Marie's child.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  I get you.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  Exactly.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  I don't know, but I, I come from, and my, my language has gotten colder as I've talked
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  with lawyers.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  Cause now I say the child.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  It's, you know, it's very terrible.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  But, um, anyway.
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  So, uh, M-[Redacted], uh, in, uh, you had, you see his, his, he has a problem.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  Um, not only has he gone, the reason he's gone mad is 11 years ago.
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  He had a spinal aneurysm, which left him paralyzed for about a year.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  And Marie was married to him at the time and nursed him back to health.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  He was able to walk again, but he did not regain all his functions.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  So, uh, his bladder, his stomach, all this stuff.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  He has to use a catheter, et cetera, et cetera.
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  Um, and of course the impotent, and that's one of the poor guys, you know, for 10 years
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  can't have sex or have a hard on.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  So, uh, oh, Marie's here by the Marie.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  This is cat.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  Mr. Ho.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  Co.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  David Co.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  Okay.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Hello.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  Thank you for calling on a Sunday night.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  Yeah.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's okay.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  It's okay.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  She listens.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  Sure.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  Sure.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  No.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  Okay.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  Thank you.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  Thanks.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Uh, so, um, 16 years.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  Sorry.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  16 years, he says.
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  And, uh, so when she, uh, they've been separated for a while because he would not allow a divorce.
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  Um, but his brain and like his body has deteriorated, but so is the brain.
[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  I mean, if you can imagine 16 years without any, I guess, sexual release or, uh, friendship.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  He hasn't had a girlfriend also in 16 years.
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  So you can, this is the type of person I'm telling you about.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  So you know this type, right?
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  Not even a girlfriend.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  So the obsession with Marie is very, very severe.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  And, um, uh, so Marlo and Marie's and I both noticed that is the deterioration has escalated
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  dramatically.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  So, so Marie took it upon herself to not, they've had a, not a shared custody agreement, but
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  since they're marrying, they've had a, um, verbal agreement where Marie pretty much has
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  Marlo, I'd say 75 to 80% of the time and Steve sees him on the weekends.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  But at this point, Marie decided that she could not trust him alone with Marlo.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  So she kept him when COVID started.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  She said, I'm going to keep him.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  I mean, I've got him for school and we can sit here and we can talk to him.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  And cause he changed a little bit around February.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  We still don't know why Marlo has.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  We don't know what's happened.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  So Marie kept him and that escalated things even further for the divorce proceedings.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  Right.
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.000]  So fast forward till very recent, about a month ago, uh, we have, we're not very well liked
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  in our, um, building area.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  We live in the brewery artist lofts.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  It's, you know, the brewery is.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  Yeah.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  I've heard of it, uh, kind of a nice, uh, kind of artsy place.
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  Yeah.
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.000]  Exactly.
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  Yeah.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  Yeah.
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.000]  Yeah.
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.000]  It's, it's a lot.
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.000]  I know, I know.
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.000]  Don't worry.
[07:40.000 --> 07:41.000]  I'm going to explain.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  I say we're not well liked here because the building management has been fighting us for
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  some time because of, of another crazy incident.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  Um, but we have to talk.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  You see, I don't want to bore David with all the details of that, but it's just a whole
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  another thing.
[07:55.000 --> 08:07.000]  So there's a woman here named Patille, uh, S-A-A-J-T-I-A-N and she lives two doors down.
[08:07.000 --> 08:13.000]  Now she recently moved into that, this flat and we didn't, we never heard of her.
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  Sorry, but, uh, we thought she was harmless at first.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  It's like typical normal art.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  Well, she's like a really bad artist.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  She makes crystal jewelry just to get to the point.
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  Like no one wants to buy a crystal jewelry.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  Um, but M-[Redacted], he's eight years old and he's very inquisitive.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  He's very talkative.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  And he was like, Oh my God, crystal jewelry.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  And she, she met him in the park and she talked to him and, um, convinced him to become her
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  apprentice for crystal jewelry.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  And remember this is COVID.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  So everyone's living with each other for the last four months.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  So everyone's going crazy.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  You know, it's, uh, what's the word?
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  Uh, you know, Jack Nicholson, the shining sort of worldwide.
[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  Yeah.
[08:50.000 --> 08:51.000]  Cabin fever.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  Cabin fever.
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.000]  Yeah.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  Cabin fever in the whole country and probably the world because everyone's living together.
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  So, uh, we figured, wow.
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.000]  Okay.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  She's, she wants M-[Redacted] to come to her place to do, to make crystal jewelry for two hours
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  of the day.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  And we're like, Oh, that's great idea for us.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  We can finally be alone for two hours.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  You know.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  So, and we, so Serrat, we think she's fairly sane.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  And, uh, Marie goes to introduce herself and we talk about a housekeeper.
