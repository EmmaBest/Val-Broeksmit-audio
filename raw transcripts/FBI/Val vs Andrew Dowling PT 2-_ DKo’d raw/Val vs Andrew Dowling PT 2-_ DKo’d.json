{"text": " Say that again, but say again you you you I sorry I got right this down now because now you lost me Hold on. Let me get a pen. Oh There's the band-aids By the way, that's an old check of mine Make people feel more comfortable when I say oh Hold on. Let me just get a pen and piece of paper so I can write this down So that way you don't think that I'm recording you All right, what do I say what do I say? I did I actually do have a pen and paper now you said ask him what? So I initially asked him like why can't you proactively take Information, okay, why can't you proactively pro is proactive of a hyphen? Proactively no retain retain information from me Okay, I'll obtain obtain. Oh not retain Well, you can retain it. No, you can retain anything You know a nearly you can retain a lot in a retentive information Why can't you anyway proactively you figure out how you want to phrase that okay? We and then if you tap the answers and doesn't give you a direct answer, okay? ask him if The information that he could receive from you Have privileged information which tainted him off a case. Oh Okay, so any info he received for me could contain may contain Privileged information That would take him off the case Yeah, and then if he doesn't answer there say Did information that you provided get him in trouble or did he just get himself in trouble on the rush of stuff Like Like Is it something that it's specific to you where like if you go and you give information to David Is that obstruction gonna go to David or is that just sticking with Tim? Because he misbehaved himself and fucked up somewhere along. Oh, no Tim is saying if I give data to him to not to not to Co but to him it would be obstruction or if he asked asked me Yeah, and I think that was by trusting me because the next thing everything's on the New York Times Right, yeah, but David Co is calling me back right now. Hold on. Let me turn on the word Let me call you right back. Okay Hello David, what's up? What happened? Well, I told you I had a meeting. Okay. I thought you were hanging up already Now, sorry. Okay. Good. I told you when remember when I first called you I said hey I gotta go to meeting in five minutes and then 15 minutes later. I said, okay. I gotta go to the meeting Hey, what did I say? I'm like, dude, I told you I had to go to the meeting. What are you? Sorry, I missed that five minutes thing. I didn't hear that one. Sorry. I just maybe the phone died But uh, okay. Sorry. So what do you think? Um, like I said the stuff with Rick Cohen and Kurt Weldon, I mean I mean, I'll add the Kurt Weldon stuff in see if that interests anyone. Um, I can get you a dossier like a Dossier like I'm sort of a so you understand it Andrew, I think would be happy to provide one or maybe he's already got one like an outline of the basic gist of the whole story And the players yeah, and the names and players involved Okay, I'll do that. Let me write that down. Actually, hold on Because otherwise I am gonna forget this. Okay, so uh dossier on Weldon and Russian thing But that's separate from fsb guy in la so it's two Okay Did you do you text me the fsb guy's name yet or I have not no Oh, I'm still writing this down dossier and Weldon Okay, um You know what could we use signal from now on or I mean are you that secure with your with your iMessages? I mean, well, I don't have signal when we can install signal on our work phone. I mean, I just buy a drop phone and use it But are you worried about people like hacking in and stealing stuff? Yeah, you know, it's pretty It I mean if I can do it be someone else will do it to me, you know, so I'm pretty sure people Uh, just iMessage. I don't know. I mean, it's encrypted end to end. So I don't know why maybe I'm just being A paranoid, but let me just check my text. So I I'll have it right here It's better to tell it to you than to text it is what I mean For that in-lessons signal Um, we think this woman's number Um Are you still in Houston in Houston? Mm-hmm. Let me see this thing Oh, here we go. Okay, um This name is k r b o y a n. That's the family name Sorry to see that name again k r b O y a n I Like uh co david co. Okay are like ricochet be like uh bonanza Oh like orient why like yandex a antelope and neuro Okay, sounds good. Is that like Sorry, that's the last name. Yeah, that's a family name. Um the number Wait, wait, uh, okay number four two four Three four six four nine zero four. That's one of his main. That's his main number Three four six four nine zed four Oh, sorry, wait, wait, sorry, that's that's Sorry, that's the wrong one. Sorry. It's eight seven zero across that out. That's a different number Actually, I don't know what the hell is that number? Wait Yeah, you know what keep that number. That's the second number Try this. This is the other one. I think this is a fake. Um This is an internet number though because it has a it's the eight seven zero eight zero zero eight zero eight zero Oh, yeah, yeah d o b, uh January 13th 1983 first name arman a r m a n Okay, so what is our fsp officer up to? Yes. Why is he in la? And why is he uh, Why is he so close to me now? And am I being paranoid Because this woman she came into my life very strangely I hired a private investigator And the private investigator, uh, really good guy worked under the police force for a long time I might have told you this already 30 years on the force and then deputy sheriff and then he was a detective for many of those years and Um instead of going to politics and becoming a sheriff he went became p. I and he's a very renowned well-known p. I He's introduced me to her And said that she's very interested in these little cords. I have these things I kind of I don't make them, but I sort of have like a it's like a hobby. You know the omg cords I can't say I do oh come on. You're a hacker. I thought you're a hacker omg card code no cord omg Oh, uh, so a guy named is a really good hacker named mg Um, you developed a really good demon seed is this sort of company he goes by demon seed and he uh great really good with encryption actually that's how I got to know him in 2016 I I heard is uh um He gave like a lecture on his encryption. They was developing for he's trying to get people into it But he was pretty good. It was like a signal before signal or around the same time signal. What's going on? but was he was really good at making these sort of So what do you call him like a usb killers or usb hacks? So if someone comes over hey, David, can I can I use your uh charger to charge up my iphone? And you're like, oh, yeah, here you go and you give him one of the chargers the cords And he plugs it in and the cord just sort of uh It does a um, it doesn't acquisition Immediately of all the data on your phone. Well, not all the data, but the high-value data Important stuff and the best part about about it is that it's it's a web server So you can log in to the damn cord and you can deliver payloads. You can do whatever, you know There's a usb cable that will automatically dump an entire phone. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool, huh? It's actually well, it's interesting. I Based on what I know of most phones I would say that the claim sounds a little bit excessive. I mean, there's some stuff you can Well, I'll tell you what come over come over to my house and charge your phone and I'll show you It's a I know it's a joke. I'm saying I'll show you that I'll show you I'll do it I'll show you a thing for it, but I have to I have Yes, yes, it's called uh because oh mg is the the guy's name and he just put it o in front of it So it's like, oh my god, you know omg Yeah, but I have to tweak it because the way it's sort of sold Honestly, it's there's some like, uh, it's a little like a miss uh miss not miss no It's a miss uh It's bad advertising because it sort of alludes to the fact that it will dump the whole fucking thing from the phone But really when you get it and you're like, what is this you unbox it? It's really the opposite. It's for the computer So, uh, but I looked it's a little different than a phone. That's what I'm saying Yeah, I know the claim that you can just plug a phone in and it'll dump everything But that's where I went there something I really I'm like, I really got a loot which Is possible I would I'll be very suspicious if it actually worked. Well, that's what I'm telling you. That's where I come in And I did my a little tweak on it. So I make it work like it's supposed to work Look, I thought it was going to work And it's not as hard as you think because uh one you always do is get by the passcode and remember These are for max mostly and for iphone's So the passcode once you can get past that it's easy because you just trick it into thinking it's an iphone It's not that hard. It's if it thinks if it thinks it's itunes passcode, but sorry Again, like that's what I mean is like there's there's a lot of other steps that need to happen Like the passcode is the very first hurdle you have to right get past exactly Well, you what what idiot is gonna put their passcode in after they plug it into No, no, no, no Of course, but no, no what the thing is you nowadays you have to hit trust this computer or trust this phone, right? right So if you can already if the if the if you can emulate emulate the itunes software Okay, which is just itunes and it's already pretty public you can find that that it's you emulate that and so the Computer believes that you've already accepted this handshake. This handshake has been Stored in somewhere in a cookie somewhere in there or a token or whatever the fuck it sees they do It's actually a token Then it's then it's okay, then you can get bypass the passcode, you know And what you can get from another payload called lock scream But somebody developed a while ago is very good Is you can get the actual passcode so it'll it'll give you the passcode it gets into that little You know, what's that thing every iphone has it's like a it's like a it's just a little file. I can't remember name Yeah, I think you're gonna go lock file. So you just basically gets a lock file Which is why it's called lock scream, you know And so you incorporate that is payload number one and then the second one you get the credentials with the You know, what's beautiful is I don't have to write anything. You just copy paste other people's scripts. So And there's 12 different Slots and banks for payloads It's really quite a cool thing So anyway, I'm trying to I told this to my private investigator He's like really I said, yeah, he's like, okay value. You know what I got I'll tell you what I'll do I'm gonna work for you guys and you don't have to pay me. I just want a one painting from Marie You know, and I want you to hook me up with one of these chords and a phone Uh, you know, you know the phones that what do you call them the you can I can with blue dirt via bluetooth Or via the rfi d chip or both I put my phone next to yours and it pulls all the data What do you call that? Well, I mean to get that claim is also very Uh I've heard and I've seen some stuff, but it's not as simple as like I put my phone next year and it feels everything Well, you then you are buddy you're you are out of the loop because I have seen those and they are Available and they do work and funny enough the only the last time I saw it was my friend Sydney It was getting divorced and her husband had that had that phone and he uh, He pulled all her data out and it was really quite amazing and that was in 2015 But at that time it took 30 minutes, so he had to leave His phone on top of hers for 30 minutes So that was the only problem was getting that to happen for 30 minutes But nowadays you don't have to have it on top of the other phone. It can be within about one the six half a foot radius So that's why I suspect rfi d is the new way it's going in not bluetooth Because you know, that's the only you can bluetooth you can go you know pretty far, but rfi d you've got to be right there, you know Still it's a lot of there's still a lot of data to pull over um that channel I mean that handshake you can't handle much. That's why they only send out like a couple numbers You know, it's like call and response with something and then decrypt it on rfi d So that's why you can only get the numbers and you can get um the messages are too big You're not getting the full dump for the phone. Well, you're getting call on the desk or maybe messages or something Well, no, no, that's the thing at first you're not getting the full dump, but then you can turn on the bluetooth Okay, and from the bluetooth you'll get the full dump So the malware will will do will have a two-step basically two prong attack How does it uh download the malware onto the victim phone from the bluetooth connection But how does it initiate a bluetooth connection without a handshake? Well, it's remember how you it's you know how like a vpn won't let you turn off the wi-fi There's a little trick in in apple that just has that stupid Some there's the bluetooth the vpn people figured out first. It's a little hack. It's not even a hack. It's just built into the code um, so if you have a Every time the user turns it off it goes the root turns it back on So and you can do that for the for that toggle that button which means you can do it for every other toggle button Wait, so How does so there's a signal that sends to the victim phone? Victim phone Then accepts this bluetooth connection without validation. No. No. No. No the the signal the signal is sent through rfid chat or for the rfid frequency um, and there's a second frequency which is not rfid, but it's like ic or is uh our There's a third one in there too. That's involved and those two Uh Shit, it's it's the credit card. What do credit cards use again? Yes, nfc. You're right. nfc rfid and fc So I think it's nfc that does the initial handshake. Sorry Then rfid and then bluetooth But at the end of the day it's always bluetooth that pulls the data because that is the fastest way to do it And the way it tricks the into the authentication Is that it deoths first everything around it and then reoff on the uh On the up on the reoff. There's somehow is uh, I don't I'm not sure exactly I'm like, I'm not a coder, but I can take a look at it and see what it is, but I don't know Like that's where I can tell you I don't know but it just does it And I think it has to do with the root if you if you can root it um, you can Via bluetooth Because uh, ios Yeah, no Dude you got to get in the field more man. I'm telling you, sydney would never use anything but an iphone She's one of those people, you know Um, since whatever whatever iphone's became a status symbol She's she's one of those in the in the husband is a billionaire. So he has no He has unlimited access to rnd Okay, so remember that too. Yeah I don't anyway, I don't know whatever The reason I say that is because um With unlimited access you can hire a team of hackers to do this for you But he didn't need to do that you can you can buy one you realize that I I do pen testing like I Whatever it doesn't no, no. I'm not tell me you do pen testing But whatever it is. Tell me it's not it's not worth like trying to figure out like how this has worked I'd like to know. No, I like the questions because you're making me think it's good Usually I just do stuff by instinct and then Yeah, whatever man, what What i'm saying is like I think the claim that you're making might be conflated with other data that might also be present There might be a lot of other things that also have to happen In order for this thing to work. Well, he's not gonna look. We're not getting we're not getting photos. That's not happening All right, we're not getting photos and videos. We're getting messages You get a full full everything on the phone. That's a clone. That's a lot. That's different a lot of information Sorry, I misspoke. I misspoke. That's a that's a clone like a complete clone the reason why I know that that's not true Is because just based on data throughput alone Like you say you have a regular iPhone that's like 64 gigs You know like 64 gigs with the data just transfer that data alone Not via either type wirelessly I mean at best at best you're gonna get like 10 15 megabytes per second And that's if you're like burning through it and you're like phone to phone 10 to 15 megabytes per second think about that it takes forever to get 64 gigs So if you thought that someone's just gonna like Oh And I'm gonna grab everything that's what I mean. It's like yeah, what if it's the wi-fi that's almost impossible It must be the wi-fi No, it's not it would be the wi-fi because if you can turn on the wi-fi and hotspot Hotspot the phone. Yeah, but like the phone can't A phone doesn't have the native ability to transfer something wi-fi to wi-fi right like Think if you have that you have an iPhone right how many ways can you transfer data? You can airdrop it you can bluetooth it which is the same thing You can transfer via wi-fi, but it has to have a specific protocol that allows it to transfer that data. So like Anyway, no, no But that's what I'm saying. It's like when you make this claim like oh, I have enough to hold on like No, no, but it verifies if you what you just said was the missing the link Because it just it verifies what I was telling you before it is It has to be bluetooth because it is the airdrop the airdrop is the fastest way to do it It's actually faster than wi-fi close differences That's gotta be it airdropping something also has a bunch of other security protocols that hey, if someone's cracked it Maybe they have I mean there's always new things every day that I know I learned about But it seems Here's the other thing is we get a lot of these claims and then we go look at it and it's fucking bullshit And then total bullshit where some Is just scamming other pretend hackers. I'm not telling you something I heard from somebody. This isn't like a Gossipy thing. I'm telling you something that I that I've seen and I know You know, maybe I got scammed. Maybe someone pulled the wool over from my eyes or something They use some other, you know, it's a good parlor trick. It's possible But I don't I don't know. I'll just I look into it. I mean I will look at Here's the other thing too is like Like I am interested in this stuff and the reason is because you know, we need to keep abreast of like what's the latest hack What's the latest vulnerability and it's always changing but You're realistically like this type of information If from an investigative standpoint is invaluable to us unless someone's using it to do something bad something illegal Like breaking into someone's phone is already illegal But you know, it's like if a proof of concept is you're just like a white hacker You're trying to find vulnerabilities. Yeah, they do it all the time. They publish white papers and You know, we read them and we go to you know, trainings on them and things like that But there's nothing illegal about that, right? So it's right while it's interesting. It's not It's only illegal if you use it And by the way, I'm just this is a side adage for the main story I was telling you We just got stuck here because it's fun to talk shop for some for once in a while But yeah, the main gist is that they wanted they they were interested in developing these things as a mass production kind of thing so, um, I got called into this meeting and uh And the lawyer was there. She wants to uh, either fund it. I wasn't quite sure what she wanted Other than Um, yeah, why he's a good guy. Okay. Yeah porter p o r t e r Order that last name. Yes, uh, uh, john. I don't know if it's an h or an n. I think it's I think it's john with an h But he's a he's a good dude Yeah, he has he owned a uh, he was sorry. He's the the warden He was the warden of a of a prison out here After that for a while too. No, he's an interesting guy. Very clever He's a former bluthangeles county sheriff's officer Bakersfield Bakersfield deputy deputy sheriff And there was a time when there was constables in california. Is that correct? There's a constable And so back then he used to work in the constables office or something. I'm not exactly sure. I'll ask him. He's coming by today um And so he was interested. He knows nothing about technology So he was very interested in this. He said val if you can actually deliver these things I know a thousand people that will spend a thousand dollars right now. I'm like, really? It's like, yeah, and like well, you can buy these online I mean, if it was that there's that much of an audience for it. I mean, you think there'd be something. I'm like hotcakes in july But they're not so Okay, so john porter Uh, you said john porter somehow introduced you to the lawyer, right the russian armenian lawyer No, yes, he introduced me to the lawyer. Yes Okay, and what's what's the lawyer's name? The lawyer's name is diana Uh with a really I don't I don't know her last name actually. I never asked But let me see but the because she says here in the text the first message I have from her is diana The second one is haids val and here's my number blah blah. So it was the introduction Text and she never put give me her last name, but I will ask john today for the last name That's her phone number I guess Um, again, I'm getting the same bullshit phone number. I'm getting a 310 400 4000 Okay, yeah, it's a fake number She's somewhat of a prodigy. She was she skipped ahead and she went to college at usc at age 16 And in ninth grade they skipped her up a few classes three grades And she was uh, she's a prodigy of some sort Very She's 31 Uh, that's another interesting thing. She was it was all international Uh, kind of you know, when you're spying, what do you do? What are those courses called international? communication is You know the one every No, no, I'm not I'm just saying that what I heard from her when we went to the meeting She told us a bit of her about her life story And um, it was actually john that brought up the she jumped ahead She's a prodigy and then she's filled it in by saying that she studied international communication international relations. Thank you And I'm the one that said, oh, that's what you know All the ciave guys study first and she could laugh and he was haha And she's actually I was approached by them and they wrote me a letter and I said, oh, can I see it? And she did not show me the letter Um asking me to work for them, but I said my real love was with the fbi. I really wanted to work with the fbi I said, oh, that's interesting. And she said, yeah, but um, you know, I just went into law Any because it was easier or something like I don't know. It's a weird story so Um, anyway, you asked I told you That's all I I don't have a last name But I haven't uh, she's 31 last thing 31 years old went to usc number 310400 4000 Yeah introduces you to uh, arm and Pribolian Incorrect incorrect asks if I can help um ask if I can help her um But I don't can't tell you too much. I don't want to tell you too much here because I don't want to get you in trouble So I was asked to help on a totally different thing because I believe this guy has some compromising videos of her, uh, you know doing uh things that people do um And uh, her boy has compromising videos of diana. Yeah okay Okay, let's them deleted Okay so her boy in I forget how to spell the crc Oh Her boy has compromising videos of diana, but isn't her boy in being represented by diana or something like that Well, it's apparently they fuck Okay I don't know. I haven't seen it yet, but I think it's them. Maybe there's someone else. I don't know but uh, okay Yeah, so But then she wants them to delete it. So she called you No, no, she's not calling me. She's not calling me. No, I was introduced For by porter because porter. Yeah, we went to meet him in a park where he was working a different case He was protecting these this Uh, a woman and her children in the park um, some sort of gang thing So it was a whole thing and then he said, you know what you guys why don't you come and have lunch with me And my friend and you should really get know her because she's someone you should know, you know And this is called networking. It's like, oh, thanks john. He's a funny guy And you know, she's a criminal defense lawyer and she's very interested in these chords that you were telling me about I said, oh, okay So marie and I go over there for lunch and she does not cook lunch But she did give us coffee, but we were there for hours talking And she was very interested in financing these chords, but I have to deliver a working chord very soon And uh, then she told me what she wanted from me I said Right Okay, which is to delete these But uh, of her that kreboyan has videos. Yeah Okay, and So kreboyan is But she and she says he's an fsb officer. She alluded to that Yes, she did not again. I told you earlier. She did not come out and say fsb officer How did she Um, because I asked Um, when we spoke about because everything she said, um with the 16 phone calls And i'm looking at everything. Oh, she's just your basic Criminal defense attorney defending drug dealers, right? But then the guys said she says that he doesn't use drugs and doesn't doesn't uh, he's not a drug dealer And then I'm like, well, why would he have 16 phones? I said, oh and I just sort of sometimes I can't really control what I say Like a Tourette's but I don't have Tourette's and I said, oh fsb And then everyone sort of laughs and suddenly I was like, who's what's fsb? Because he's a little too old to understand that they changed kgb to fsb And then I'm like, oh, uh, and I started then she starts explaining, you know, she fills in my senses and then Uh, she said something That made it sort of click With me that it was fsb And it was something that she so there's a hacker named ruslan, you know ruslan How do you spell ruslan are you slan? Incident no Oh, man Yeah, you are you're a bit out there about touch buddy. Sorry, but this guy ruslan You want me to make up man like every time I can't know everything in the fun. I'm busting your balls. Relax. I'm busting your balls, man Like every time you know about omg course, man, I don't know about fucking on Ah, dude, I'm busting your balls. Relax. Relax. You don't have a partner to bust balls with it's fun Yes, look, you got this guy ruslan. He's a russian hacker and he's a pretty fucking good by the way He's one of the best and he uh, I don't know exactly I'll fan but if I get my computer pull it off. He was working. She was handling his case and uh Shit, where's my computer here? If she was handling his case and she was working out a deal over he was going to hand himself over to the fbi And because this is your specialty.
