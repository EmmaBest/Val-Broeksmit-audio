0	7480	Say that again, but say again you you you I sorry I got right this down now because now you lost me
7480	9480	Hold on. Let me get a pen. Oh
12480	14480	There's the band-aids
24640	26640	By the way, that's an old check of mine
30680	34040	Make people feel more comfortable when I say oh
35040	38520	Hold on. Let me just get a pen and piece of paper so I can write this down
39120	41640	So that way you don't think that I'm recording you
45000	50240	All right, what do I say what do I say? I did I actually do have a pen and paper now you said ask him what?
52160	57800	So I initially asked him like why can't you proactively take
58720	63800	Information, okay, why can't you proactively pro is proactive of a hyphen?
65080	70000	Proactively no retain retain information from me
71160	75080	Okay, I'll obtain obtain. Oh not retain
76680	80000	Well, you can retain it. No, you can retain anything
80960	85420	You know a nearly you can retain a lot in a retentive information
86420	91420	Why can't you anyway proactively you figure out how you want to phrase that okay?
91420	96260	We and then if you tap the answers and doesn't give you a direct answer, okay?
97220	99220	ask him if
102860	105700	The information that he could receive from you
106300	111820	Have privileged information which tainted him off a case. Oh
112460	118860	Okay, so any info he received for me could contain may contain
119900	121900	Privileged information
122300	124300	That would take him off the case
125660	129500	Yeah, and then if he doesn't answer there say
130020	136620	Did information that you provided get him in trouble or did he just get himself in trouble on
137340	138860	the rush of stuff
138860	140860	Like
141180	143180	Like
144180	150700	Is it something that it's specific to you where like if you go and you give information to David
150780	155180	Is that obstruction gonna go to David or is that just sticking with Tim?
156380	163820	Because he misbehaved himself and fucked up somewhere along. Oh, no Tim is saying if I give data to him to not to not to
164460	170260	Co but to him it would be obstruction or if he asked asked me
175300	180940	Yeah, and I think that was by trusting me because the next thing everything's on the New York Times
183740	187740	Right, yeah, but David Co is calling me back right now. Hold on. Let me turn on the word
189260	191260	Let me call you right back. Okay
192220	194220	Hello
194380	196380	David, what's up? What happened?
196780	200620	Well, I told you I had a meeting. Okay. I thought you were hanging up already
201900	206380	Now, sorry. Okay. Good. I told you when remember when I first called you I said hey
206380	210380	I gotta go to meeting in five minutes and then 15 minutes later. I said, okay. I gotta go to the meeting
210620	213740	Hey, what did I say? I'm like, dude, I told you I had to go to the meeting. What are you?
214140	218540	Sorry, I missed that five minutes thing. I didn't hear that one. Sorry. I just maybe the phone died
218620	222940	But uh, okay. Sorry. So what do you think?
224300	229580	Um, like I said the stuff with Rick Cohen and Kurt Weldon, I mean
231020	236540	I mean, I'll add the Kurt Weldon stuff in see if that interests anyone. Um, I can get you a dossier
237340	238460	like a
238460	241260	Dossier like I'm sort of a so you understand it
241660	247740	Andrew, I think would be happy to provide one or maybe he's already got one like an outline of the basic gist of the whole story
249020	251260	And the players yeah, and the names and players involved
252300	254700	Okay, I'll do that. Let me write that down. Actually, hold on
255660	262300	Because otherwise I am gonna forget this. Okay, so uh dossier on Weldon and Russian thing
262540	266620	But that's separate from fsb guy in la so it's two
267340	268860	Okay
268860	273260	Did you do you text me the fsb guy's name yet or I have not no
273900	275900	Oh, I'm still writing this down dossier and Weldon
276860	278860	Okay, um
279900	285820	You know what could we use signal from now on or I mean are you that secure with your with your iMessages?
287260	294060	I mean, well, I don't have signal when we can install signal on our work phone. I mean, I just buy a drop phone and use it
294140	300540	But are you worried about people like hacking in and stealing stuff? Yeah, you know, it's pretty
301100	302700	It
302700	306860	I mean if I can do it be someone else will do it to me, you know, so I'm pretty sure people
307740	312220	Uh, just iMessage. I don't know. I mean, it's encrypted end to end. So I don't know why maybe I'm just being
312780	316380	A paranoid, but let me just check my text. So I I'll have it right here
316540	318620	It's better to tell it to you than to text it is what I mean
319340	321340	For that in-lessons signal
321500	323500	Um, we think this woman's number
324460	326460	Um
326540	328860	Are you still in Houston in Houston?
329740	331740	Mm-hmm. Let me see this thing
335900	337900	Oh, here we go. Okay, um
339500	345180	This name is k r b o y a n. That's the family name
346300	348060	Sorry to see that name again
348060	350060	k r b
351340	353340	O y a n
354300	356300	I
359900	366060	Like uh co david co. Okay are like ricochet be like uh bonanza
366620	372860	Oh like orient why like yandex a antelope and neuro
375180	377180	Okay, sounds good. Is that like
378060	382780	Sorry, that's the last name. Yeah, that's a family name. Um the number
383340	386540	Wait, wait, uh, okay number four two four
387340	391900	Three four six four nine zero four. That's one of his main. That's his main number
395020	399900	Three four six four nine zed four
402940	404940	Oh, sorry, wait, wait, sorry, that's that's
405900	409900	Sorry, that's the wrong one. Sorry. It's eight seven zero across that out. That's a different number
410380	412380	Actually, I don't know what the hell is that number? Wait
413820	415820	Yeah, you know what keep that number. That's the second number
416540	419260	Try this. This is the other one. I think this is a fake. Um
419820	423180	This is an internet number though because it has a it's the eight seven zero
423980	427100	eight zero zero eight zero eight zero
429900	433260	Oh, yeah, yeah d o b, uh
434380	440460	January 13th 1983 first name arman a r m a n
443580	451980	Okay, so what is our fsp officer up to? Yes. Why is he in la? And why is he uh,
452940	454940	Why is he so close to me now?
457820	459820	And am I being paranoid
459820	465040	Because this woman she came into my life very strangely I hired a private investigator
466060	471340	And the private investigator, uh, really good guy worked under the police force for a long time
471340	473100	I might have told you this already
473100	479340	30 years on the force and then deputy sheriff and then he was a detective for many of those years and
480220	486940	Um instead of going to politics and becoming a sheriff he went became p. I and he's a very renowned well-known p. I
487740	489740	He's introduced me to her
489900	494300	And said that she's very interested in these little cords. I have these things
495820	497020	I kind of
497100	502460	I don't make them, but I sort of have like a it's like a hobby. You know the omg cords
504940	508620	I can't say I do oh come on. You're a hacker. I thought you're a hacker
509740	513020	omg card code no cord omg
514460	518940	Oh, uh, so a guy named is a really good hacker named mg
520860	525260	Um, you developed a really good demon seed is this sort of company he goes by demon seed
525980	532540	and he uh great really good with encryption actually that's how I got to know him in 2016 I I heard is uh
533340	534700	um
534700	539420	He gave like a lecture on his encryption. They was developing for he's trying to get people into it
539420	543740	But he was pretty good. It was like a signal before signal or around the same time signal. What's going on?
544300	546780	but was he was really good at making these sort of
547740	550700	So what do you call him like a usb killers or usb hacks?
551500	556780	So if someone comes over hey, David, can I can I use your uh charger to charge up my iphone?
556860	560220	And you're like, oh, yeah, here you go and you give him one of the chargers the cords
560860	564540	And he plugs it in and the cord just sort of uh
566060	568060	It does a um, it doesn't acquisition
568620	572780	Immediately of all the data on your phone. Well, not all the data, but the high-value data
573420	577980	Important stuff and the best part about about it is that it's it's a web server
578620	583900	So you can log in to the damn cord and you can deliver payloads. You can do whatever, you know
585180	591180	There's a usb cable that will automatically dump an entire phone. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool, huh?
591820	594220	It's actually well, it's interesting. I
595260	597260	Based on what I
597980	599980	know of most phones
602140	606060	I would say that the claim sounds a little bit excessive. I mean, there's some stuff you can
606220	610540	Well, I'll tell you what come over come over to my house and charge your phone and I'll show you
615420	619180	It's a I know it's a joke. I'm saying I'll show you that I'll show you I'll do it
619180	621420	I'll show you a thing for it, but I have to
622460	624460	I have
626140	631420	Yes, yes, it's called uh because oh mg is the the guy's name and he just put it o in front of it
631500	633500	So it's like, oh my god, you know omg
634460	638780	Yeah, but I have to tweak it because the way it's sort of sold
639420	644220	Honestly, it's there's some like, uh, it's a little like a miss uh miss not miss no
644220	645420	It's a miss uh
645420	650860	It's bad advertising because it sort of alludes to the fact that it will dump the whole fucking thing from the phone
651660	657820	But really when you get it and you're like, what is this you unbox it? It's really the opposite. It's for the computer
658780	662780	So, uh, but I looked it's a little different than a phone. That's what I'm saying
663260	667500	Yeah, I know the claim that you can just plug a phone in and it'll dump everything
667740	672460	But that's where I went there something I really I'm like, I really got a loot which
673100	674780	Is possible
674780	679740	I would I'll be very suspicious if it actually worked. Well, that's what I'm telling you. That's where I come in
680780	684140	And I did my a little tweak on it. So I make it work like it's supposed to work
684220	686220	Look, I thought it was going to work
686220	691180	And it's not as hard as you think because uh one you always do is get by the passcode and remember
691180	693660	These are for max mostly and for iphone's
694380	699580	So the passcode once you can get past that it's easy because you just trick it into thinking it's an iphone
700220	705260	It's not that hard. It's if it thinks if it thinks it's itunes passcode, but sorry
707100	710780	Again, like that's what I mean is like there's there's a lot of other steps that need to happen
710780	715660	Like the passcode is the very first hurdle you have to right get past exactly
716780	720140	Well, you what what idiot is gonna put their passcode in after they plug it into
720540	722540	No, no, no, no
722780	728700	Of course, but no, no what the thing is you nowadays you have to hit trust this computer or trust this phone, right?
729340	729820	right
729820	735900	So if you can already if the if the if you can emulate emulate the itunes software
736220	743580	Okay, which is just itunes and it's already pretty public you can find that that it's you emulate that and so the
744060	747660	Computer believes that you've already accepted this handshake. This handshake has been
749500	754380	Stored in somewhere in a cookie somewhere in there or a token or whatever the fuck it sees they do
755180	757180	It's actually a token
758060	762220	Then it's then it's okay, then you can get bypass the passcode, you know
763020	766860	And what you can get from another payload called lock scream
767660	769900	But somebody developed a while ago is very good
770540	776140	Is you can get the actual passcode so it'll it'll give you the passcode it gets into that little
776700	781660	You know, what's that thing every iphone has it's like a it's like a it's just a little file. I can't remember name
782620	785740	Yeah, I think you're gonna go lock file. So you just basically gets a lock file
786460	788460	Which is why it's called lock scream, you know
789340	795100	And so you incorporate that is payload number one and then the second one you get the credentials with the
795660	799900	You know, what's beautiful is I don't have to write anything. You just copy paste other people's scripts. So
800700	802700	And there's 12 different
802700	804700	Slots and banks for payloads
805340	807340	It's really quite a cool thing
807580	810540	So anyway, I'm trying to I told this to my private investigator
811020	816140	He's like really I said, yeah, he's like, okay value. You know what I got I'll tell you what I'll do
816700	821340	I'm gonna work for you guys and you don't have to pay me. I just want a one painting from Marie
821820	826540	You know, and I want you to hook me up with one of these chords and a phone
827260	831980	Uh, you know, you know the phones that what do you call them the you can I can with blue dirt via bluetooth
832060	837500	Or via the rfi d chip or both I put my phone next to yours and it pulls all the data
839420	841420	What do you call that?
841580	844540	Well, I mean to get that claim is also very
845260	847260	Uh
847660	853420	I've heard and I've seen some stuff, but it's not as simple as like I put my phone next year and it feels everything
853820	858060	Well, you then you are buddy you're you are out of the loop because I have seen those and they are
858620	863580	Available and they do work and funny enough the only the last time I saw it was my friend Sydney
863580	867980	It was getting divorced and her husband had that had that phone and he uh,
868540	873660	He pulled all her data out and it was really quite amazing and that was in 2015
875340	878460	But at that time it took 30 minutes, so he had to leave
879020	881100	His phone on top of hers for 30 minutes
881180	883660	So that was the only problem was getting that to happen for 30 minutes
883660	889740	But nowadays you don't have to have it on top of the other phone. It can be within about one the six half a foot radius
890780	894620	So that's why I suspect rfi d is the new way it's going in not bluetooth
895260	900780	Because you know, that's the only you can bluetooth you can go you know pretty far, but rfi d you've got to be right there, you know
901740	906140	Still it's a lot of there's still a lot of data to pull over um that channel
908220	911740	I mean that handshake you can't handle much. That's why they only send out like a couple numbers
911980	916780	You know, it's like call and response with something and then decrypt it on rfi d
917580	922460	So that's why you can only get the numbers and you can get um the messages are too big
923100	928380	You're not getting the full dump for the phone. Well, you're getting call on the desk or maybe messages or something
928620	933980	Well, no, no, that's the thing at first you're not getting the full dump, but then you can turn on the bluetooth
934460	936460	Okay, and from the bluetooth you'll get the full dump
937420	943020	So the malware will will do will have a two-step basically two prong attack
944140	948620	How does it uh download the malware onto the victim phone from the bluetooth connection
949660	952940	But how does it initiate a bluetooth connection without a handshake?
953260	957980	Well, it's remember how you it's you know how like a vpn won't let you turn off the wi-fi
958380	961260	There's a little trick in in apple that just has that stupid
961420	967660	Some there's the bluetooth the vpn people figured out first. It's a little hack. It's not even a hack. It's just built into the code
968220	970220	um, so if you have a
970460	973820	Every time the user turns it off it goes the root turns it back on
975100	980540	So and you can do that for the for that toggle that button which means you can do it for every other toggle button
981820	983100	Wait, so
983100	986300	How does so there's a signal that sends to the victim phone?
987020	988620	Victim phone
988620	996300	Then accepts this bluetooth connection without validation. No. No. No. No the the signal the signal is sent through rfid chat
996780	998780	or for the rfid frequency
999180	1005100	um, and there's a second frequency which is not rfid, but it's like ic or is uh our
1006140	1009020	There's a third one in there too. That's involved and those two
1009740	1011740	Uh
1011740	1014140	Shit, it's it's the credit card. What do credit cards use again?
1015260	1018700	Yes, nfc. You're right. nfc rfid and fc
1018780	1021500	So I think it's nfc that does the initial handshake. Sorry
1021900	1024300	Then rfid and then bluetooth
1024380	1028940	But at the end of the day it's always bluetooth that pulls the data because that is the fastest way to do it
1029420	1032460	And the way it tricks the into the authentication
1033020	1037980	Is that it deoths first everything around it and then reoff on the uh
1038460	1042940	On the up on the reoff. There's somehow is uh, I don't I'm not sure exactly
1043100	1047260	I'm like, I'm not a coder, but I can take a look at it and see what it is, but I don't know
1047980	1050220	Like that's where I can tell you I don't know but it just does it
1051260	1055100	And I think it has to do with the root if you if you can root it
1055740	1057740	um, you can
1058860	1060860	Via bluetooth
1060860	1062860	Because uh, ios
1064300	1066300	Yeah, no
1072300	1077500	Dude you got to get in the field more man. I'm telling you, sydney would never use anything but an iphone
1077820	1079820	She's one of those people, you know
1079980	1082940	Um, since whatever whatever iphone's became a status symbol
1082940	1086780	She's she's one of those in the in the husband is a billionaire. So he has no
1087340	1089820	He has unlimited access to rnd
1091420	1093420	Okay, so remember that too. Yeah
1094940	1096940	I don't anyway, I don't know whatever
1097820	1099820	The reason I say that is because um
1100300	1103900	With unlimited access you can hire a team of hackers to do this for you
1103900	1109100	But he didn't need to do that you can you can buy one you realize that I I do pen testing like I
1109980	1112700	Whatever it doesn't no, no. I'm not tell me you do pen testing
1113580	1119420	But whatever it is. Tell me it's not it's not worth like trying to figure out like how this has worked
1120140	1123580	I'd like to know. No, I like the questions because you're making me think it's good
1123820	1126620	Usually I just do stuff by instinct and then
1129980	1131980	Yeah, whatever man, what
1132780	1138300	What i'm saying is like I think the claim that you're making might be conflated with other data that might also be present
1138300	1140780	There might be a lot of other things that also have to happen
1141340	1146380	In order for this thing to work. Well, he's not gonna look. We're not getting we're not getting photos. That's not happening
1146540	1149020	All right, we're not getting photos and videos. We're getting messages
1149420	1155900	You get a full full everything on the phone. That's a clone. That's a lot. That's different a lot of information
1156060	1161980	Sorry, I misspoke. I misspoke. That's a that's a clone like a complete clone the reason why I know that that's not true
1161980	1165340	Is because just based on data throughput alone
1166060	1169100	Like you say you have a regular iPhone that's like 64 gigs
1169580	1174780	You know like 64 gigs with the data just transfer that data alone
1175180	1177180	Not via either type wirelessly
1177500	1182140	I mean at best at best you're gonna get like 10 15 megabytes per second
1182380	1185580	And that's if you're like burning through it and you're like phone to phone
1186300	1190700	10 to 15 megabytes per second think about that it takes forever to get 64 gigs
1191180	1193180	So if you thought that someone's just gonna like
1193340	1194380	Oh
1194380	1199740	And I'm gonna grab everything that's what I mean. It's like yeah, what if it's the wi-fi that's almost impossible
1199900	1201660	It must be the wi-fi
1201660	1205660	No, it's not it would be the wi-fi because if you can turn on the wi-fi and hotspot
1206220	1209420	Hotspot the phone. Yeah, but like the phone can't
1210220	1215020	A phone doesn't have the native ability to transfer something wi-fi to wi-fi right like
1215260	1218220	Think if you have that you have an iPhone right how many ways can you transfer data?
1218460	1221500	You can airdrop it you can bluetooth it which is the same thing
1221900	1227740	You can transfer via wi-fi, but it has to have a specific protocol that allows it to transfer that data. So like
1228460	1230460	Anyway, no, no
1231340	1234620	But that's what I'm saying. It's like when you make this claim like oh, I have enough to hold on like
1234700	1238860	No, no, but it verifies if you what you just said was the missing the link
1239420	1242060	Because it just it verifies what I was telling you before it is
1242620	1246700	It has to be bluetooth because it is the airdrop the airdrop is the fastest way to do it
1246780	1248780	It's actually faster than wi-fi close differences
1249260	1255340	That's gotta be it airdropping something also has a bunch of other security protocols that hey, if someone's cracked it
1255420	1259020	Maybe they have I mean there's always new things every day that I know I learned about
1259580	1261580	But it seems
1262780	1267740	Here's the other thing is we get a lot of these claims and then we go look at it and it's fucking bullshit
1267900	1269900	And then total bullshit where some
1270460	1275420	Is just scamming other pretend hackers. I'm not telling you something I heard from somebody. This isn't like a
1276140	1279340	Gossipy thing. I'm telling you something that I that I've seen and I know
1279980	1283180	You know, maybe I got scammed. Maybe someone pulled the wool over from my eyes or something
1283260	1285980	They use some other, you know, it's a good parlor trick. It's possible
1286620	1289820	But I don't I don't know. I'll just I look into it. I mean I will look at
1290700	1292700	Here's the other thing too is like
1293260	1298700	Like I am interested in this stuff and the reason is because you know, we need to keep abreast of like what's the latest hack
1298700	1301980	What's the latest vulnerability and it's always changing but
1302940	1305500	You're realistically like this type of information
1306940	1311660	If from an investigative standpoint is invaluable to us unless someone's using it to do something bad something illegal
1312140	1314700	Like breaking into someone's phone is already illegal
1314860	1319500	But you know, it's like if a proof of concept is you're just like a white hacker
1319900	1323580	You're trying to find vulnerabilities. Yeah, they do it all the time. They publish white papers and
1324140	1327340	You know, we read them and we go to you know, trainings on them and things like that
1327740	1331580	But there's nothing illegal about that, right? So it's right while it's interesting. It's not
1332540	1334540	It's only illegal if you use it
1334540	1338300	And by the way, I'm just this is a side adage for the main story I was telling you
1338300	1341820	We just got stuck here because it's fun to talk shop for some for once in a while
1342620	1348940	But yeah, the main gist is that they wanted they they were interested in developing these things as a mass production kind of thing
1349580	1353420	so, um, I got called into this meeting and uh
1354140	1360060	And the lawyer was there. She wants to uh, either fund it. I wasn't quite sure what she wanted
1360700	1362700	Other than
1364940	1371100	Um, yeah, why he's a good guy. Okay. Yeah porter p o r t e r
1372380	1378700	Order that last name. Yes, uh, uh, john. I don't know if it's an h or an n. I think it's I think it's john with an h
1379660	1381660	But he's a he's a good dude
1381660	1385020	Yeah, he has he owned a uh, he was sorry. He's the the warden
1386060	1388300	He was the warden of a of a prison out here
1389420	1392700	After that for a while too. No, he's an interesting guy. Very clever
1393660	1396940	He's a former bluthangeles county sheriff's officer
1397100	1400060	Bakersfield Bakersfield deputy deputy sheriff
1400780	1404940	And there was a time when there was constables in california. Is that correct? There's a constable
1406140	1412540	And so back then he used to work in the constables office or something. I'm not exactly sure. I'll ask him. He's coming by today
1413500	1414780	um
1414780	1417500	And so he was interested. He knows nothing about technology
1418220	1421740	So he was very interested in this. He said val if you can actually deliver these things
1421820	1425180	I know a thousand people that will spend a thousand dollars right now. I'm like, really?
1425980	1428140	It's like, yeah, and like well, you can buy these online
1428700	1434540	I mean, if it was that there's that much of an audience for it. I mean, you think there'd be something. I'm like hotcakes in july
1435420	1437420	But they're not so
1437580	1439580	Okay, so john porter
1439740	1445980	Uh, you said john porter somehow introduced you to the lawyer, right the russian armenian lawyer
1446860	1449100	No, yes, he introduced me to the lawyer. Yes
1450060	1452060	Okay, and what's what's the lawyer's name?
1452540	1454540	The lawyer's name is diana
1455420	1456620	Uh
1456620	1458620	with a really
1458620	1461020	I don't I don't know her last name actually. I never asked
1461660	1467980	But let me see but the because she says here in the text the first message I have from her is diana
1468700	1472140	The second one is haids val and here's my number blah blah. So it was the introduction
1472700	1475020	Text and she never put give me her last name, but I will ask
1475740	1477740	john today for the last name
1478460	1480540	That's her phone number I guess
1481420	1486380	Um, again, I'm getting the same bullshit phone number. I'm getting a 310 400 4000
1488380	1490700	Okay, yeah, it's a fake number
1491660	1499020	She's somewhat of a prodigy. She was she skipped ahead and she went to college at usc at age 16
1499740	1503500	And in ninth grade they skipped her up a few classes three grades
1504220	1506860	And she was uh, she's a prodigy of some sort
1507500	1509500	Very
1510780	1512780	She's 31
1512780	1515900	Uh, that's another interesting thing. She was it was all international
1516700	1522140	Uh, kind of you know, when you're spying, what do you do? What are those courses called international?
1523100	1524700	communication is
1524700	1526700	You know the one every
1528380	1533100	No, no, I'm not I'm just saying that what I heard from her when we went to the meeting
1533180	1535180	She told us a bit of her about her life story
1535420	1539420	And um, it was actually john that brought up the she jumped ahead
1540140	1545660	She's a prodigy and then she's filled it in by saying that she studied international communication international relations. Thank you
1545820	1548060	And I'm the one that said, oh, that's what you know
1548300	1551180	All the ciave guys study first and she could laugh and he was haha
1551500	1556140	And she's actually I was approached by them and they wrote me a letter and I said, oh, can I see it?
1556140	1558140	And she did not show me the letter
1558860	1563820	Um asking me to work for them, but I said my real love was with the fbi. I really wanted to work with the fbi
1563900	1568140	I said, oh, that's interesting. And she said, yeah, but um, you know, I just went into law
1568220	1571180	Any because it was easier or something like I don't know. It's a weird story
1571900	1572940	so
1572940	1575020	Um, anyway, you asked I told you
1576460	1578460	That's all I I don't have a last name
1579260	1581660	But I haven't uh, she's 31 last thing
1582540	1584780	31 years old went to usc number
1585500	1587500	310400 4000
1587660	1588860	Yeah
1588860	1590860	introduces you to
1591420	1593020	uh, arm and
1593020	1595020	Pribolian
1595020	1600060	Incorrect incorrect asks if I can help um ask if I can help her
1601260	1603260	um
1603420	1607660	But I don't can't tell you too much. I don't want to tell you too much here because I don't want to get you in trouble
1608860	1615020	So I was asked to help on a totally different thing because I believe this guy has some compromising
1615660	1616860	videos
1616860	1620380	of her, uh, you know doing uh things that people do
1621260	1622060	um
1622060	1626300	And uh, her boy has compromising videos of diana. Yeah
1627180	1629180	okay
1629260	1631260	Okay, let's them deleted
1632780	1634620	Okay
1634620	1635420	so
1635420	1637420	her boy in
1637420	1639420	I forget how to spell the crc
1640460	1642460	Oh
1642620	1649740	Her boy has compromising videos of diana, but isn't her boy in being represented by diana or something like that
1650700	1653180	Well, it's apparently they fuck
1653900	1655900	Okay
1666700	1672380	I don't know. I haven't seen it yet, but I think it's them. Maybe there's someone else. I don't know but uh, okay
1672860	1674380	Yeah, so
1674380	1677180	But then she wants them to delete it. So she called you
1677820	1681660	No, no, she's not calling me. She's not calling me. No, I was introduced
1682220	1688380	For by porter because porter. Yeah, we went to meet him in a park where he was working a different case
1689100	1691100	He was protecting these this
1692140	1694860	Uh, a woman and her children in the park
1695420	1697420	um, some sort of gang thing
1698220	1702220	So it was a whole thing and then he said, you know what you guys why don't you come and have lunch with me
1702540	1706060	And my friend and you should really get know her because she's someone you should know, you know
1706140	1709100	And this is called networking. It's like, oh, thanks john. He's a funny guy
1709420	1714700	And you know, she's a criminal defense lawyer and she's very interested in these chords that you were telling me about
1714860	1716220	I said, oh, okay
1716220	1719580	So marie and I go over there for lunch and she does not cook lunch
1719980	1722620	But she did give us coffee, but we were there for hours talking
1723420	1729020	And she was very interested in financing these chords, but I have to deliver a working chord very soon
1729660	1732380	And uh, then she told me what she wanted from me
1733340	1734380	I said
1734380	1736380	Right
1738460	1740860	Okay, which is to delete these
1741420	1745100	But uh, of her that kreboyan has videos. Yeah
1748540	1750540	Okay, and
1750540	1752540	So kreboyan is
1752620	1756700	But she and she says he's an fsb officer. She alluded to that
1757500	1761660	Yes, she did not again. I told you earlier. She did not come out and say fsb officer
1762460	1764460	How did she
1765340	1767340	Um, because I asked
1768060	1773340	Um, when we spoke about because everything she said, um with the 16 phone calls
1773980	1776220	And i'm looking at everything. Oh, she's just your basic
1777180	1779980	Criminal defense attorney defending drug dealers, right?
1780700	1786060	But then the guys said she says that he doesn't use drugs and doesn't doesn't uh, he's not a drug dealer
1786620	1791420	And then I'm like, well, why would he have 16 phones? I said, oh and I just sort of sometimes I can't really control what I say
1791660	1794300	Like a Tourette's but I don't have Tourette's and I said, oh fsb
1795100	1798780	And then everyone sort of laughs and suddenly I was like, who's what's fsb?
1798860	1801900	Because he's a little too old to understand that they changed kgb to fsb
1802620	1808460	And then I'm like, oh, uh, and I started then she starts explaining, you know, she fills in my senses and then
1809180	1811180	Uh, she said something
1812860	1814860	That made it sort of click
1814940	1816940	With me that it was fsb
1817100	1821020	And it was something that she so there's a hacker named ruslan, you know ruslan
1822140	1824940	How do you spell ruslan are you slan?
1826940	1828060	Incident no
1828060	1829580	Oh, man
1829580	1833980	Yeah, you are you're a bit out there about touch buddy. Sorry, but this guy ruslan
1834700	1836700	You want me to make up man like every time
1837260	1842140	I can't know everything in the fun. I'm busting your balls. Relax. I'm busting your balls, man
1842220	1845500	Like every time you know about omg course, man, I don't know about fucking on
1845580	1850300	Ah, dude, I'm busting your balls. Relax. Relax. You don't have a partner to bust balls with it's fun
1851260	1856380	Yes, look, you got this guy ruslan. He's a russian hacker and he's a pretty fucking good by the way
1856380	1860060	He's one of the best and he uh, I don't know exactly
1860620	1865900	I'll fan but if I get my computer pull it off. He was working. She was handling his case
1866940	1868780	and uh
1868780	1870140	Shit, where's my computer here?
1870140	1873580	If she was handling his case and she was working out a deal over he was going to hand himself
1874380	1876380	over to the fbi
1876380	1879740	And because this is your specialty. So that's what I'm telling you
1880700	1882700	and at the very last day
1883420	1888540	Uh, he's supposed to show up to court and turn himself in and get some sort of uh suspended sentence or something
1889020	1890460	some sort of deal
1890460	1894700	He got on it was well, we don't she didn't say for sure
1894780	1899260	It was a plane but he left the country and went to Kiev on that very same day
1899900	1903660	And everyone went to court and we're waiting for him for a while a long time
1904540	1908220	When he uh, I think called from a some either a plane or a boat or something
1908460	1910460	Somehow somehow he got to the Ukraine
1911180	1913180	Is it his greatest career?
