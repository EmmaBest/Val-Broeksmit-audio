01:18.080 --> 01:23.320
to divide and conquer yeah I mean we're drowning yeah and you've been doing

01:23.320 --> 01:28.040
thank you for everything you gave us and my my response to them was hey can you

01:28.040 --> 01:32.760
guys manage what Val's giving and I'll manage the other aspects and I should

01:32.760 --> 01:37.440
have been on top of them or more I apologize one other thing that I mean

01:37.440 --> 01:40.280
now that now that the cat's out of the hat and that he sent that report the

01:40.280 --> 01:44.760
other thing I did mention to the gentleman was hey listen I was in their

01:44.760 --> 01:52.080
house and I'm not at you know I'm not a an expert in you know in child services

01:52.080 --> 01:58.720
I think but you know he appears to be loved he had a dedicated you know nice

01:58.720 --> 02:03.600
child friendly living space I mean he has his bedroom up there yeah he loves it

02:03.600 --> 02:06.840
man and I'm so thank you thank you how come that does not come through on here

02:06.840 --> 02:09.600
how come they changed your words perverted and I don't know you said he

02:09.600 --> 02:14.840
talked to a guy Sabah is a woman she says she's looking directly I spoke with

02:14.840 --> 02:23.480
I spoke with a gentleman in the FBI or DCFS the DSF DCFS she says you know what

02:23.480 --> 02:29.280
no I spoke I spoke to a gentleman but I think there was a woman conference in

02:29.280 --> 02:33.200
but she didn't do any of the talking with the gentleman that did that most of

02:33.200 --> 02:38.760
the talking so that's completely taken out of context your words I mean yeah I

02:38.760 --> 02:42.960
think so and they certainly didn't say they were gonna generate a report and I

02:43.000 --> 02:47.200
would have liked to have read the report she's a man I'll show if you want to

02:47.200 --> 02:51.840
I'll send it to you man it is outrageously bizarre yeah like our lawyer we

02:51.840 --> 02:55.440
got a lawyer that's fucking expensive man for this and you look at this he's

02:55.440 --> 02:59.560
done this 10,000 times at this district you've never seen anything like this I'll

02:59.560 --> 03:03.360
say I will take from the limited experience I've had I mean in New York I've

03:03.360 --> 03:12.160
made obviously I've made arrests and whatnot and the circumstances surrounding

03:12.600 --> 03:17.320
in those situations were horrendous and nothing was done and in those

03:17.320 --> 03:25.160
circumstances I've made referrals I called I called an agent out of Los

03:25.160 --> 03:29.720
Angeles an agent out of Houston that I know that deals with this sort of stuff

03:29.720 --> 03:36.200
and they asked if you would be okay if I forwarded you there forwarded them your

03:36.200 --> 03:42.040
information they might be able to help okay all right one guy's name is one

03:42.120 --> 03:48.160
guy's name is Kevin I need a pen hold on Marie by the way Marie is here and

03:48.160 --> 03:53.280
Tim how are you good how are you Mary here let me write this down sorry you

03:53.280 --> 04:00.840
said what's it actually David David Ho H.O. David and I don't know I don't know

04:00.840 --> 04:04.720
the LA agent's name but he told me that he knows somebody in LA okay you have a

04:04.720 --> 04:09.600
number so can I give him I'll give him your number perfect okay so I'll wait for

04:09.600 --> 04:15.120
David okay all right I'll do that now and then yeah I wanted to call you I

04:15.120 --> 04:18.760
couldn't but and I do think some of that was taken out of context and I'd be

04:18.760 --> 04:23.440
happy to you know how you could fix it you know what you do we need witness

04:23.440 --> 04:26.880
statements so people that have been if that have seen Marie and I and Marla

04:26.880 --> 04:30.400
together and just saying that we're normal good people you know from what I've

04:30.400 --> 04:35.240
seen Marla is happy he's well-fed my god man this listen to buy there's a

04:35.240 --> 04:41.080
bipolar woman living next door and Steve is the is will not let her divorce

04:41.080 --> 04:45.440
Steve has been like doing I can't will do that getting into too much he's been

04:45.440 --> 04:49.200
it like just obsessively trying to get me out of her life so he can keep her

04:49.200 --> 04:54.240
after 10 years of being separate and trying to get it so he's using this

04:54.240 --> 05:00.200
bipolar woman she says I have 50 cell phones okay she does I'm not even

05:00.200 --> 05:04.160
making that up I'll send you her statement 50 cell phones Marlo is foraging

05:04.160 --> 05:10.760
through the garbage in a barefoot and wearing only shorts to find food after

05:10.760 --> 05:15.720
after midnight right says that Marie is also dumpster diving for furniture and

05:15.720 --> 05:20.320
clothes what does it say what does it say it's crazy out there shit man and

05:20.320 --> 05:24.520
these people at DCFS are so incompetent they can't see tell

05:24.520 --> 05:31.680
when they're talking to a crazy bipolar woman yeah it escalates because Steve

05:31.720 --> 05:36.760
feeds her and all this comes from Steve and two friends of Steve's that say

05:36.760 --> 05:43.120
that we're drug addicts from 2018 18 right yeah see in France where is he

05:43.120 --> 05:47.280
Steve is here he won't go anywhere close to Marie he's from Australia but he's

05:47.280 --> 05:50.880
still here in the police he's like 20 minutes away you cannot leave versus site

05:50.880 --> 05:55.280
he hasn't had a girlfriend in 10 years like look the basic gist he had a

05:55.280 --> 06:00.040
aneurysm in his back which left him paralyzed from the waist down in 2004 he

06:00.040 --> 06:05.040
has a catheter to go to the bathroom he the guy has he can't no erection he has

06:05.040 --> 06:11.200
not had sex in over 14 years right so that that will erode someone's brain and

06:11.200 --> 06:16.660
Marie has seen it escalate lately so what she did during coronavirus because

06:16.660 --> 06:20.320
he got so scary for her that she decided I'm not gonna give Marlo back for the

06:20.320 --> 06:23.400
next three months so I'm gonna keep him now because they don't have a custody

06:23.400 --> 06:28.720
arrangement so she kept him for the last five months yeah and she's scared a lot

06:28.720 --> 06:33.000
of people around here but not to do you know good and that's good it's good to

06:33.000 --> 06:36.720
hear because she was terrified what's gonna happen and this is his retaliation

06:36.720 --> 06:42.560
calling DCFS four times in a row four times and they come in here and then at

06:42.560 --> 06:45.600
first like if you read the report you'll see everything's great for the first 14

06:45.600 --> 06:49.680
pages and all of a sudden we're the worst people in the world and there all

06:49.680 --> 06:53.320
right but if you could write a witness statement Tim that would and that would

06:53.320 --> 06:56.920
be a clincher that would be so fucking valuable and helpful for us from coming

06:56.920 --> 07:00.680
from you especially all right yeah I don't think a problem with it I had to

07:00.680 --> 07:03.680
bounce it off of my legal folks I mean it's already it's already my concern would

07:03.680 --> 07:08.000
be disclosing our relationship but I think that's already out there I don't

07:08.000 --> 07:13.400
think that I don't think it would be a huge issue okay let me also understand

07:13.400 --> 07:16.960
your information to the to the agents out there right now and if you don't

07:16.960 --> 07:20.200
hear from them in the next couple of days circle back to me we'll do all right

07:20.200 --> 07:23.480

07:23.480 --> 07:26.960
Ho is the name we're sorry Mary would you say I mean if you don't want to talk

07:26.960 --> 07:31.000
about your affairs and what you did with Val you can just say I can satisfy that

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
these people are not abusing the child yeah and they're not yeah our relationship

07:37.000 --> 07:41.600
doesn't matter as much as what your your perception of our the relationship is

07:41.600 --> 07:50.240
Marie and myself and Marlon yeah we're feeding him this food in the fridge he's

07:50.240 --> 07:56.280
