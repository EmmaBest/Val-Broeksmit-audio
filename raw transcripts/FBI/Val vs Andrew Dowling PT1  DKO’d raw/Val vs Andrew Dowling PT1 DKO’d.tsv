0	10660	Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yep, I can hear you. Okay, good.
10740	15660	Hold on a second. Yep, I got you. Let me just find a cigarette. That's the guy I was telling
15660	24240	you about. About what? Give me some context. So, remember I called and told you about this
24240	29980	guy that, for instance, for a very long time has been doing this credit card scam, this
29980	36720	fraud thing he's been doing with people's, like, I'm not sure exactly how it works, but
36720	40720	remember I was like, I couldn't get his last name and I couldn't figure out his first name
40720	46880	either, but I just got it today, found my notes. He wants me to work for him again. But
46880	57700	of course, I said no again. But it's a scam where he adds credit card numbers to existing
57700	64100	accounts or dead accounts that still exist on paper somewhere. The people could have been
64100	69100	dead for years or canceled their accounts for years, but he still has the card and he charges
69100	74380	them, I don't know, $16 a month or he jacks it up to $32. And no one really does anything,
74380	78660	but the bank, it's something where the bank sees it and it's only when the bank spots it
78660	83400	does he stop the, close the card. But when people complain, he says, oh yes, I'm sorry,
83520	87080	we'll take it off right away. But then they never take it off. And generally people don't
87080	96920	notice $15, you know, scattered off through, with a no name, some, you know, ubiquitous thing
96920	102280	attached to it, like global systems, you know, something like that. That's the guy's name.
102280	109440	So he does $300,000 a month is at his peak, but I don't think he's doing that now. I think
109440	113580	he's doing less because he couldn't really, because numbers he was offering were like really
113580	117880	low for something like this anyway. So I figured he just wasn't trying to lowball people.
117880	121420	What? How do you know he was doing $300,000 a month?
121540	126640	Oh God, he came in here and like, because he wanted Marie to paint something for him,
126680	132240	I remember. And that's how we got started on his thing. It was, he started just going,
132380	137420	man, he's like one of those people that will speak for an hour straight and you'll try to
137420	141240	get something into the conversation, but he'll just like talk over you and get, because he
141240	145100	wants to direct the whole conversation for himself. He doesn't realize that you're exasperated
145100	150320	after 45 minutes and you want him to leave. He doesn't pick up on that. One of those types,
150580	157980	you know? So that's how I learned, because he did that to me for about, I mean, 45 minutes,
158040	161860	I would be lucky if I got out 45 minutes. It was closer to two hours.
164100	168500	Okay. So, and so he obviously lives in LA, I guess?
168500	174400	Yeah, he's in LA. He's somewhere out here. He's, uh, uh, they call him the baby mama.
174560	180980	So that means it's his girlfriend's. So his daughter's girlfriend is a woman named Brooke.
180980	184600	All right. What about his daughter's girlfriend?
184860	188040	His baby mama. I just don't know baby mama. I always thought that was the other, I don't
188040	194460	really know the lingo, but his girlfriend, his wife, sorry, no, his daughter's wife, and
194460	199120	they're not married is, uh, I don't know what she is now, but she used to be some kind of
199120	205400	porn star or something. Her name is Brooke. Um, fuck. I want to say Brooke Barnes, but that's,
205460	208140	that's a New York times writer. Um,
208140	209280	She's white.
209780	210420	No, what?
210580	210860	Yeah.
211860	212020	No.
212020	214580	She's his daughter's wife, Brooke, is a porn star.
214580	220200	I was a porn star, but now she's just sort of like a junkie that doesn't, uh, that's kind
220200	224040	of crazy. And she's talks a lot of strange things and says,
224040	228680	I never met her, but, uh, I got secondhand information from someone else that did meet
228680	233680	her. And she said a whole bunch of stuff about, about the, uh, she mentioned, mentioned the
233680	238840	Russian, uh, pay, pay loan, payday loaning thing. I don't know how good her information
238840	242720	is. Cause she's kind of, I mean, apparently what I've heard again, I'm shouldn't be quick
242720	248820	to judge, but, um, especially just someone else's judgment. So I don't know. I, uh, maybe
248820	253040	it's worth digging into later from my own, but she's the one that brought up the fact
253040	257880	that there was, uh, which verified my suspicions that it was something to do with the Russian
257880	264460	payday loaning scam that Andrew actually had figured out years ago. Um, and that's where
264460	270460	they, they'll call you and say, David, uh, or David Coe, you owe us, uh, $2,000 from
270460	275740	a copy machine or printer that you bought, um, in 1999 and you never paid it. Could you
275740	280340	please pay back this, uh, loan we gave you? And of course you never, you never did this
280340	284520	and it doesn't exist except for something that a guy created on paper. And then they
284520	292300	found that 65, 70% of people will pay this, this, uh, phantom fine. Right. And that it's
292300	296860	a billion dollar business today in America. Um, and that's kind of why I put you in touch
296860	300700	with Andrew too, because he's one of his life's goals is to take down these, these people.
301000	307260	And I thought you guys would get along. Um, but it's interesting because, uh, if he's involved
307260	313340	with that, that makes it even bigger, an even bigger thing. I don't know if it's true, but
313340	318480	it's what I heard. Plus it's a problem for you because it's going to make, it's a political
318480	324660	at the end of the, of the, um, at the end of the rainbow. No, at the end of the, uh, what's
324660	330020	the word where you, the food chain is a politician. So that's not going to be good for you.
331280	336360	Um, like an American politician. Yes. American politician. So that's going to make you guys
336360	342780	look bad. Uh, Kurt Weldon? Weldon? Kurt Weldon. Yeah. Kurt Weldon? Okay. I think
342780	347680	Kurt might be wrong. Kurt Weldon is behind. Kurt might be, Kurt might be wrong, but Weldon
347680	352820	is, is correct. The first name I'm not sure. I'll have to look, uh, ask Andrew or just look
352820	361220	online. What is his, uh, I don't know. Oh dude, it's bad. He's a bad guy. So yeah. Like
361220	370460	what is his participation in this payday loan or the credit card scheme? Well, he, he brings
370460	374980	in, he gets permission, uh, permits, not permits. He gets, what's the word where you sort of
374980	382300	allow a Russian to work if you're sanctioned? Um, he gets sanctioned Russians. Yeah, not quite
382300	386700	a visa though. It's something else. He gets the, he's, they're allowed to work, uh, in the
386700	396380	States. Um, but only under the, uh, auspices of the, uh, like a, it gets a little convoluted
396380	404860	here because if you are on a, um, Indian territory, um, Indian, uh, reservation territory, you have
404860	410080	different laws. So you can operate on that reservation under those reservation laws. If
410080	415200	you can claim that you are, uh, uh, you know, American Indian or you can't say Indian anymore.
415280	419980	What's the word? Native American. Yes. Native American. So if you're Native American, uh, and
419980	424240	they somehow got Russians to be, you know, to say that the Russian Native American. So
424240	432180	that's what his thing, he also was able to go to Congress and lobby for, um, looser controls
432180	439160	to, for these companies. And he is so brazen. Like it's, it's, it's, he's got balls, like a
439160	442560	silver set of balls, man. He's brazen. He just goes right there in Congress and just
442560	447200	says, yes, we need less restrictions on payday loaning and payday lenders and in the, and
447200	451120	the weight in their, uh, the, or the opposite of the lending, the, the collection of it as
451120	457740	well. And, uh, basically just, uh, allowing violence, you know, and terrible things happen
457740	463500	to people. Um, so how do you know Weldon is behind all this? Well, it's no secret. That's
463500	470240	not the secret. Uh, the secret is, is who is Weldon also infronting? Um, Weldon does,
470320	476280	does not, he's not shy about saying he's, you know, Andrew's the one to speak to. He's
476280	483200	the expert. I'll ask him. Um, but it's the, it's a Russian he's working in, in, in partnership
483200	488420	with a few, uh, really nasty Russians and the Russians are nasty because they can, they
488420	494500	come from a very specific crime family. Um, and there was a recent, um, there was a
494500	499380	recent, uh, there's a recent, uh, something in New York with this. Let me see. I wrote
499380	506020	it down, you know, I didn't want to forget this. So hold on. Um, where do I write it
506020	512140	down? You know what? I wasn't that prepared. So I just, I'll get it for you later. But I
512140	516420	wrote down the name of the family, the Russian family. Uh, it's not McGill, McGill, McGill,
516420	523660	it's a different Russian, uh, gangster family that was very hooked into this, but, uh, Weldon
523660	530700	helps them make billions of dollars. And Weldon himself is now a billionaire, um, through
530700	536100	this, through this exact, uh, this thing. And the people that get hurt are just the everyday
536100	541080	people that don't want to get in trouble. And they believe that they owe someone a thousand
541080	544220	dollars. Cause they said, someone calls them on the phone and says, you owe us a thousand
544220	546280	dollars. They're like, Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. And we pay you back.
546420	551340	Um, and those that don't and say, no, I don't, um, I don't owe you money. They get,
551340	557040	um, stocked up to the point where they're like, what happened to Andrew and say, well,
557040	561800	we're going to come over and rape your wife. Shit like that. Right. And it gets bad. It's
561800	564080	really bad. And it's rampant.
564080	570680	If I, if I, if I understand it correctly, um, Kurt Weldon, who's a congressman, is he
570680	572540	a, uh, past reps?
573040	578360	Again, uh, do you have a computer? Hold on. Let me just load up my computer. Um, again,
578460	581160	Kurt might not be the right, Kurt could be the wrong name.
581200	585380	Oh, I can look them. I can look them up later. If you don't, I'm just trying to get as many
585380	590040	details as I can. That's okay. I got my computer. So it's okay. It's working on her. I mean,
590040	594320	I'm, I'm looking at futures tanking right now, so I just don't want to go on this computer
594320	599440	cause I want to watch myself lose more money today. But hold on a second. It was a really
599440	605300	bad idea. The fucking Dow Jones just went through the roof. Um, right after Trump's COVID thing,
605380	612600	I thought it was going to go down. So that was bad. Um, let me see here. Weldon. Um, I have
612600	620380	notes on it. Welding and machine money laundering. Oh man. Oh, can you guys, if I, if I ever
620380	627280	do work for you guys, can you give me a new computer? I mean, we're, we're talking about
627280	632280	a lot of you. No, I'm sorry. Just the damn thing to shut down on me. Hold on. I need a
632280	637380	new battery. Um, yeah, there's a lot here. There's a lot here. Um, and it's, this is, I've,
637480	641780	I got the bottom of the food chain. Well, actually more of a middle manager guy. Uh, the bottom
641780	646260	of the food chain would be the guys that collect the money. But this, uh, the guy I just met,
646260	652960	um, well, not just met, but, uh, just, uh, in talking about now, Rick Cohen is a middle
652960	661440	manager. Um, so the higher up guys would be the Russian, um, the Russian sort of on paper,
661520	664840	the owners of the different companies. And it's all actually at the end of the day, it
664840	669860	all goes to one company, one, but it looks like there's a lot of different companies. So
669860	675520	they have a monopoly on it as well. And Weldon is the guy that allows this to happen. Weldon
675520	682280	and, and, so, is he Weldon in Congress? He might be Congressman. I think he's not a
682280	687700	Senator, but I could be wrong. Oh, Congressman Weldon, Florida. Kurt, it is Kurt. I was right.
687840	695880	Kurt Weldon. Okay. Kurt, Wayne Curtis Weldon. Yeah. Um, wait, there's a Senator, Senate
695880	699760	Judiciary Committee investigating Kurt Weldon. Okay. So they started investigating him in
699760	706260	2018, but that never went anywhere with an FBI probe. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, that's right.
706300	710860	And the Atlantic, I'm going to forward you this article from the Atlantic. It's good. Um,
710860	718660	but the guy you want to talk to, who's got extensive notes is Andrew. He is the man on this
718660	723520	and he, I don't know if he wants to tell you though. Um, but I will ask him. I'll ask him
723520	731460	first. Um, are you still there? Oh, I just got a missed call from you. What the hell? Oh, my phone
731460	735980	died. Shit. I'm talking to myself now. Hold on. I mean, why am I telling you to hold on? You're not
735980	738980	even on the phone? All right.
738980	742980	Tch, tch, tch, tch.
742980	744980	Okay.
765980	795080	Tch, tch, tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch, tch. Tch, tch, tch, tch. tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch tch. Tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch.
795080	825060	Thank you.
825080	855060	Thank you.
855080	885060	Thank you.
885080	915060	Thank you.
915080	945060	Thank you.
945080	947080	Thank you.
