1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,660
Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yep, I can hear you. Okay, good.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,660
Hold on a second. Yep, I got you. Let me just find a cigarette. That's the guy I was telling

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,240
you about. About what? Give me some context. So, remember I called and told you about this

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,980
guy that, for instance, for a very long time has been doing this credit card scam, this

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,720
fraud thing he's been doing with people's, like, I'm not sure exactly how it works, but

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,720
remember I was like, I couldn't get his last name and I couldn't figure out his first name

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,880
either, but I just got it today, found my notes. He wants me to work for him again. But

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:57,700
of course, I said no again. But it's a scam where he adds credit card numbers to existing

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:04,100
accounts or dead accounts that still exist on paper somewhere. The people could have been

10
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,100
dead for years or canceled their accounts for years, but he still has the card and he charges

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,380
them, I don't know, $16 a month or he jacks it up to $32. And no one really does anything,

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,660
but the bank, it's something where the bank sees it and it's only when the bank spots it

13
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,400
does he stop the, close the card. But when people complain, he says, oh yes, I'm sorry,

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,080
we'll take it off right away. But then they never take it off. And generally people don't

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:36,920
notice $15, you know, scattered off through, with a no name, some, you know, ubiquitous thing

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,280
attached to it, like global systems, you know, something like that. That's the guy's name.

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,440
So he does $300,000 a month is at his peak, but I don't think he's doing that now. I think

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,580
he's doing less because he couldn't really, because numbers he was offering were like really

19
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,880
low for something like this anyway. So I figured he just wasn't trying to lowball people.

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,420
What? How do you know he was doing $300,000 a month?

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,640
Oh God, he came in here and like, because he wanted Marie to paint something for him,

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,240
I remember. And that's how we got started on his thing. It was, he started just going,

23
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,420
man, he's like one of those people that will speak for an hour straight and you'll try to

24
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,240
get something into the conversation, but he'll just like talk over you and get, because he

25
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,100
wants to direct the whole conversation for himself. He doesn't realize that you're exasperated

26
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,320
after 45 minutes and you want him to leave. He doesn't pick up on that. One of those types,

27
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,980
you know? So that's how I learned, because he did that to me for about, I mean, 45 minutes,

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,860
I would be lucky if I got out 45 minutes. It was closer to two hours.

29
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,500
Okay. So, and so he obviously lives in LA, I guess?

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,400
Yeah, he's in LA. He's somewhere out here. He's, uh, uh, they call him the baby mama.

31
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,980
So that means it's his girlfriend's. So his daughter's girlfriend is a woman named Brooke.

32
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,600
All right. What about his daughter's girlfriend?

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,040
His baby mama. I just don't know baby mama. I always thought that was the other, I don't

34
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,460
really know the lingo, but his girlfriend, his wife, sorry, no, his daughter's wife, and

35
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,120
they're not married is, uh, I don't know what she is now, but she used to be some kind of

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,400
porn star or something. Her name is Brooke. Um, fuck. I want to say Brooke Barnes, but that's,

37
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,140
that's a New York times writer. Um,

38
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,280
She's white.

39
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,420
No, what?

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:30,860
Yeah.

41
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,020
No.

42
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,580
She's his daughter's wife, Brooke, is a porn star.

43
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,200
I was a porn star, but now she's just sort of like a junkie that doesn't, uh, that's kind

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,040
of crazy. And she's talks a lot of strange things and says,

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,680
I never met her, but, uh, I got secondhand information from someone else that did meet

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,680
her. And she said a whole bunch of stuff about, about the, uh, she mentioned, mentioned the

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,840
Russian, uh, pay, pay loan, payday loaning thing. I don't know how good her information

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,720
is. Cause she's kind of, I mean, apparently what I've heard again, I'm shouldn't be quick

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,820
to judge, but, um, especially just someone else's judgment. So I don't know. I, uh, maybe

50
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,040
it's worth digging into later from my own, but she's the one that brought up the fact

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,880
that there was, uh, which verified my suspicions that it was something to do with the Russian

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,460
payday loaning scam that Andrew actually had figured out years ago. Um, and that's where

53
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,460
they, they'll call you and say, David, uh, or David Coe, you owe us, uh, $2,000 from

54
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,740
a copy machine or printer that you bought, um, in 1999 and you never paid it. Could you

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,340
please pay back this, uh, loan we gave you? And of course you never, you never did this

56
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,520
and it doesn't exist except for something that a guy created on paper. And then they

57
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:52,300
found that 65, 70% of people will pay this, this, uh, phantom fine. Right. And that it's

58
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,860
a billion dollar business today in America. Um, and that's kind of why I put you in touch

59
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,700
with Andrew too, because he's one of his life's goals is to take down these, these people.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,260
And I thought you guys would get along. Um, but it's interesting because, uh, if he's involved

61
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:13,340
with that, that makes it even bigger, an even bigger thing. I don't know if it's true, but

62
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,480
it's what I heard. Plus it's a problem for you because it's going to make, it's a political

63
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,660
at the end of the, of the, um, at the end of the rainbow. No, at the end of the, uh, what's

64
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,020
the word where you, the food chain is a politician. So that's not going to be good for you.

65
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,360
Um, like an American politician. Yes. American politician. So that's going to make you guys

66
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,780
look bad. Uh, Kurt Weldon? Weldon? Kurt Weldon. Yeah. Kurt Weldon? Okay. I think

67
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,680
Kurt might be wrong. Kurt Weldon is behind. Kurt might be, Kurt might be wrong, but Weldon

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,820
is, is correct. The first name I'm not sure. I'll have to look, uh, ask Andrew or just look

69
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:01,220
online. What is his, uh, I don't know. Oh dude, it's bad. He's a bad guy. So yeah. Like

70
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:10,460
what is his participation in this payday loan or the credit card scheme? Well, he, he brings

71
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,980
in, he gets permission, uh, permits, not permits. He gets, what's the word where you sort of

72
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:22,300
allow a Russian to work if you're sanctioned? Um, he gets sanctioned Russians. Yeah, not quite

73
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,700
a visa though. It's something else. He gets the, he's, they're allowed to work, uh, in the

74
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:36,380
States. Um, but only under the, uh, auspices of the, uh, like a, it gets a little convoluted

75
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:44,860
here because if you are on a, um, Indian territory, um, Indian, uh, reservation territory, you have

76
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,080
different laws. So you can operate on that reservation under those reservation laws. If

77
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,200
you can claim that you are, uh, uh, you know, American Indian or you can't say Indian anymore.

78
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,980
What's the word? Native American. Yes. Native American. So if you're Native American, uh, and

79
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,240
they somehow got Russians to be, you know, to say that the Russian Native American. So

80
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:12,180
that's what his thing, he also was able to go to Congress and lobby for, um, looser controls

81
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,160
to, for these companies. And he is so brazen. Like it's, it's, it's, he's got balls, like a

82
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,560
silver set of balls, man. He's brazen. He just goes right there in Congress and just

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,200
says, yes, we need less restrictions on payday loaning and payday lenders and in the, and

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,120
the weight in their, uh, the, or the opposite of the lending, the, the collection of it as

85
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,740
well. And, uh, basically just, uh, allowing violence, you know, and terrible things happen

86
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,500
to people. Um, so how do you know Weldon is behind all this? Well, it's no secret. That's

87
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,240
not the secret. Uh, the secret is, is who is Weldon also infronting? Um, Weldon does,

88
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,280
does not, he's not shy about saying he's, you know, Andrew's the one to speak to. He's

89
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,200
the expert. I'll ask him. Um, but it's the, it's a Russian he's working in, in, in partnership

90
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,420
with a few, uh, really nasty Russians and the Russians are nasty because they can, they

91
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,500
come from a very specific crime family. Um, and there was a recent, um, there was a

92
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,380
recent, uh, there's a recent, uh, something in New York with this. Let me see. I wrote

93
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:26,020
it down, you know, I didn't want to forget this. So hold on. Um, where do I write it

94
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,140
down? You know what? I wasn't that prepared. So I just, I'll get it for you later. But I

95
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,420
wrote down the name of the family, the Russian family. Uh, it's not McGill, McGill, McGill,

96
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:43,660
it's a different Russian, uh, gangster family that was very hooked into this, but, uh, Weldon

97
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:50,700
helps them make billions of dollars. And Weldon himself is now a billionaire, um, through

98
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,100
this, through this exact, uh, this thing. And the people that get hurt are just the everyday

99
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,080
people that don't want to get in trouble. And they believe that they owe someone a thousand

100
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,220
dollars. Cause they said, someone calls them on the phone and says, you owe us a thousand

101
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,280
dollars. They're like, Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. And we pay you back.

102
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,340
Um, and those that don't and say, no, I don't, um, I don't owe you money. They get,

103
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:17,040
um, stocked up to the point where they're like, what happened to Andrew and say, well,

104
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,800
we're going to come over and rape your wife. Shit like that. Right. And it gets bad. It's

105
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,080
really bad. And it's rampant.

106
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,680
If I, if I, if I understand it correctly, um, Kurt Weldon, who's a congressman, is he

107
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,540
a, uh, past reps?

108
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,360
Again, uh, do you have a computer? Hold on. Let me just load up my computer. Um, again,

109
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,160
Kurt might not be the right, Kurt could be the wrong name.

110
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,380
Oh, I can look them. I can look them up later. If you don't, I'm just trying to get as many

111
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,040
details as I can. That's okay. I got my computer. So it's okay. It's working on her. I mean,

112
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm, I'm looking at futures tanking right now, so I just don't want to go on this computer

113
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,440
cause I want to watch myself lose more money today. But hold on a second. It was a really

114
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,300
bad idea. The fucking Dow Jones just went through the roof. Um, right after Trump's COVID thing,

115
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,600
I thought it was going to go down. So that was bad. Um, let me see here. Weldon. Um, I have

116
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,380
notes on it. Welding and machine money laundering. Oh man. Oh, can you guys, if I, if I ever

117
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,280
do work for you guys, can you give me a new computer? I mean, we're, we're talking about

118
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,280
a lot of you. No, I'm sorry. Just the damn thing to shut down on me. Hold on. I need a

119
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,380
new battery. Um, yeah, there's a lot here. There's a lot here. Um, and it's, this is, I've,

120
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,780
I got the bottom of the food chain. Well, actually more of a middle manager guy. Uh, the bottom

121
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,260
of the food chain would be the guys that collect the money. But this, uh, the guy I just met,

122
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,960
um, well, not just met, but, uh, just, uh, in talking about now, Rick Cohen is a middle

123
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:01,440
manager. Um, so the higher up guys would be the Russian, um, the Russian sort of on paper,

124
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,840
the owners of the different companies. And it's all actually at the end of the day, it

125
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,860
all goes to one company, one, but it looks like there's a lot of different companies. So

126
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,520
they have a monopoly on it as well. And Weldon is the guy that allows this to happen. Weldon

127
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:22,280
and, and, so, is he Weldon in Congress? He might be Congressman. I think he's not a

128
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,700
Senator, but I could be wrong. Oh, Congressman Weldon, Florida. Kurt, it is Kurt. I was right.

129
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:35,880
Kurt Weldon. Okay. Kurt, Wayne Curtis Weldon. Yeah. Um, wait, there's a Senator, Senate

130
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,760
Judiciary Committee investigating Kurt Weldon. Okay. So they started investigating him in

131
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,260
2018, but that never went anywhere with an FBI probe. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, that's right.

132
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,860
And the Atlantic, I'm going to forward you this article from the Atlantic. It's good. Um,

133
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:58,660
but the guy you want to talk to, who's got extensive notes is Andrew. He is the man on this

134
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,520
and he, I don't know if he wants to tell you though. Um, but I will ask him. I'll ask him

135
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,460
first. Um, are you still there? Oh, I just got a missed call from you. What the hell? Oh, my phone

136
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,980
died. Shit. I'm talking to myself now. Hold on. I mean, why am I telling you to hold on? You're not

137
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,980
even on the phone? All right.

138
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,980
Tch, tch, tch, tch.

139
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
