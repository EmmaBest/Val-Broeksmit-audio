00:00.000 --> 00:10.660
Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yep, I can hear you. Okay, good.

00:10.740 --> 00:15.660
Hold on a second. Yep, I got you. Let me just find a cigarette. That's the guy I was telling

00:15.660 --> 00:24.240
you about. About what? Give me some context. So, remember I called and told you about this

00:24.240 --> 00:29.980
guy that, for instance, for a very long time has been doing this credit card scam, this

00:29.980 --> 00:36.720
fraud thing he's been doing with people's, like, I'm not sure exactly how it works, but

00:36.720 --> 00:40.720
remember I was like, I couldn't get his last name and I couldn't figure out his first name

00:40.720 --> 00:46.880
either, but I just got it today, found my notes. He wants me to work for him again. But

00:46.880 --> 00:57.700
of course, I said no again. But it's a scam where he adds credit card numbers to existing

00:57.700 --> 01:04.100
accounts or dead accounts that still exist on paper somewhere. The people could have been

01:04.100 --> 01:09.100
dead for years or canceled their accounts for years, but he still has the card and he charges

01:09.100 --> 01:14.380
them, I don't know, $16 a month or he jacks it up to $32. And no one really does anything,

01:14.380 --> 01:18.660
but the bank, it's something where the bank sees it and it's only when the bank spots it

01:18.660 --> 01:23.400
does he stop the, close the card. But when people complain, he says, oh yes, I'm sorry,

01:23.520 --> 01:27.080
we'll take it off right away. But then they never take it off. And generally people don't

01:27.080 --> 01:36.920
notice $15, you know, scattered off through, with a no name, some, you know, ubiquitous thing

01:36.920 --> 01:42.280
attached to it, like global systems, you know, something like that. That's the guy's name.

01:42.280 --> 01:49.440
So he does $300,000 a month is at his peak, but I don't think he's doing that now. I think

01:49.440 --> 01:53.580
he's doing less because he couldn't really, because numbers he was offering were like really

01:53.580 --> 01:57.880
low for something like this anyway. So I figured he just wasn't trying to lowball people.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.420
What? How do you know he was doing $300,000 a month?

02:01.540 --> 02:06.640
Oh God, he came in here and like, because he wanted Marie to paint something for him,

02:06.680 --> 02:12.240
I remember. And that's how we got started on his thing. It was, he started just going,

02:12.380 --> 02:17.420
man, he's like one of those people that will speak for an hour straight and you'll try to

02:17.420 --> 02:21.240
get something into the conversation, but he'll just like talk over you and get, because he

02:21.240 --> 02:25.100
wants to direct the whole conversation for himself. He doesn't realize that you're exasperated

02:25.100 --> 02:30.320
after 45 minutes and you want him to leave. He doesn't pick up on that. One of those types,

02:30.580 --> 02:37.980
you know? So that's how I learned, because he did that to me for about, I mean, 45 minutes,

02:38.040 --> 02:41.860
I would be lucky if I got out 45 minutes. It was closer to two hours.

02:44.100 --> 02:48.500
Okay. So, and so he obviously lives in LA, I guess?

02:48.500 --> 02:54.400
Yeah, he's in LA. He's somewhere out here. He's, uh, uh, they call him the baby mama.

02:54.560 --> 03:00.980
So that means it's his girlfriend's. So his daughter's girlfriend is a woman named Brooke.

03:00.980 --> 03:04.600
All right. What about his daughter's girlfriend?

03:04.860 --> 03:08.040
His baby mama. I just don't know baby mama. I always thought that was the other, I don't

03:08.040 --> 03:14.460
really know the lingo, but his girlfriend, his wife, sorry, no, his daughter's wife, and

03:14.460 --> 03:19.120
they're not married is, uh, I don't know what she is now, but she used to be some kind of

03:19.120 --> 03:25.400
porn star or something. Her name is Brooke. Um, fuck. I want to say Brooke Barnes, but that's,

03:25.460 --> 03:28.140
that's a New York times writer. Um,

03:28.140 --> 03:29.280
She's white.

03:29.780 --> 03:30.420
No, what?

03:30.580 --> 03:30.860
Yeah.

03:31.860 --> 03:32.020
No.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.580
She's his daughter's wife, Brooke, is a porn star.

03:34.580 --> 03:40.200
I was a porn star, but now she's just sort of like a junkie that doesn't, uh, that's kind

03:40.200 --> 03:44.040
of crazy. And she's talks a lot of strange things and says,

03:44.040 --> 03:48.680
I never met her, but, uh, I got secondhand information from someone else that did meet

03:48.680 --> 03:53.680
her. And she said a whole bunch of stuff about, about the, uh, she mentioned, mentioned the

03:53.680 --> 03:58.840
Russian, uh, pay, pay loan, payday loaning thing. I don't know how good her information

03:58.840 --> 04:02.720
is. Cause she's kind of, I mean, apparently what I've heard again, I'm shouldn't be quick

04:02.720 --> 04:08.820
to judge, but, um, especially just someone else's judgment. So I don't know. I, uh, maybe

04:08.820 --> 04:13.040
it's worth digging into later from my own, but she's the one that brought up the fact

04:13.040 --> 04:17.880
that there was, uh, which verified my suspicions that it was something to do with the Russian

04:17.880 --> 04:24.460
payday loaning scam that Andrew actually had figured out years ago. Um, and that's where

04:24.460 --> 04:30.460
they, they'll call you and say, David, uh, or David Coe, you owe us, uh, $2,000 from

04:30.460 --> 04:35.740
a copy machine or printer that you bought, um, in 1999 and you never paid it. Could you

04:35.740 --> 04:40.340
please pay back this, uh, loan we gave you? And of course you never, you never did this

04:40.340 --> 04:44.520
and it doesn't exist except for something that a guy created on paper. And then they

04:44.520 --> 04:52.300
found that 65, 70% of people will pay this, this, uh, phantom fine. Right. And that it's

04:52.300 --> 04:56.860
a billion dollar business today in America. Um, and that's kind of why I put you in touch

04:56.860 --> 05:00.700
with Andrew too, because he's one of his life's goals is to take down these, these people.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.260
And I thought you guys would get along. Um, but it's interesting because, uh, if he's involved

05:07.260 --> 05:13.340
with that, that makes it even bigger, an even bigger thing. I don't know if it's true, but

05:13.340 --> 05:18.480
it's what I heard. Plus it's a problem for you because it's going to make, it's a political

05:18.480 --> 05:24.660
at the end of the, of the, um, at the end of the rainbow. No, at the end of the, uh, what's

05:24.660 --> 05:30.020
the word where you, the food chain is a politician. So that's not going to be good for you.

05:31.280 --> 05:36.360
Um, like an American politician. Yes. American politician. So that's going to make you guys

05:36.360 --> 05:42.780
look bad. Uh, Kurt Weldon? Weldon? Kurt Weldon. Yeah. Kurt Weldon? Okay. I think

05:42.780 --> 05:47.680
Kurt might be wrong. Kurt Weldon is behind. Kurt might be, Kurt might be wrong, but Weldon

05:47.680 --> 05:52.820
is, is correct. The first name I'm not sure. I'll have to look, uh, ask Andrew or just look

05:52.820 --> 06:01.220
online. What is his, uh, I don't know. Oh dude, it's bad. He's a bad guy. So yeah. Like

06:01.220 --> 06:10.460
what is his participation in this payday loan or the credit card scheme? Well, he, he brings

06:10.460 --> 06:14.980
in, he gets permission, uh, permits, not permits. He gets, what's the word where you sort of

06:14.980 --> 06:22.300
allow a Russian to work if you're sanctioned? Um, he gets sanctioned Russians. Yeah, not quite

06:22.300 --> 06:26.700
a visa though. It's something else. He gets the, he's, they're allowed to work, uh, in the

06:26.700 --> 06:36.380
States. Um, but only under the, uh, auspices of the, uh, like a, it gets a little convoluted

06:36.380 --> 06:44.860
here because if you are on a, um, Indian territory, um, Indian, uh, reservation territory, you have

06:44.860 --> 06:50.080
different laws. So you can operate on that reservation under those reservation laws. If

06:50.080 --> 06:55.200
you can claim that you are, uh, uh, you know, American Indian or you can't say Indian anymore.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.980
What's the word? Native American. Yes. Native American. So if you're Native American, uh, and

06:59.980 --> 07:04.240
they somehow got Russians to be, you know, to say that the Russian Native American. So

07:04.240 --> 07:12.180
that's what his thing, he also was able to go to Congress and lobby for, um, looser controls

07:12.180 --> 07:19.160
to, for these companies. And he is so brazen. Like it's, it's, it's, he's got balls, like a

07:19.160 --> 07:22.560
silver set of balls, man. He's brazen. He just goes right there in Congress and just

07:22.560 --> 07:27.200
says, yes, we need less restrictions on payday loaning and payday lenders and in the, and

07:27.200 --> 07:31.120
the weight in their, uh, the, or the opposite of the lending, the, the collection of it as

07:31.120 --> 07:37.740
well. And, uh, basically just, uh, allowing violence, you know, and terrible things happen

07:37.740 --> 07:43.500
to people. Um, so how do you know Weldon is behind all this? Well, it's no secret. That's

07:43.500 --> 07:50.240
not the secret. Uh, the secret is, is who is Weldon also infronting? Um, Weldon does,

07:50.320 --> 07:56.280
does not, he's not shy about saying he's, you know, Andrew's the one to speak to. He's

07:56.280 --> 08:03.200
the expert. I'll ask him. Um, but it's the, it's a Russian he's working in, in, in partnership

08:03.200 --> 08:08.420
with a few, uh, really nasty Russians and the Russians are nasty because they can, they

08:08.420 --> 08:14.500
come from a very specific crime family. Um, and there was a recent, um, there was a

08:14.500 --> 08:19.380
recent, uh, there's a recent, uh, something in New York with this. Let me see. I wrote

08:19.380 --> 08:26.020
it down, you know, I didn't want to forget this. So hold on. Um, where do I write it

08:26.020 --> 08:32.140
down? You know what? I wasn't that prepared. So I just, I'll get it for you later. But I

08:32.140 --> 08:36.420
wrote down the name of the family, the Russian family. Uh, it's not McGill, McGill, McGill,

08:36.420 --> 08:43.660
it's a different Russian, uh, gangster family that was very hooked into this, but, uh, Weldon

08:43.660 --> 08:50.700
helps them make billions of dollars. And Weldon himself is now a billionaire, um, through

08:50.700 --> 08:56.100
this, through this exact, uh, this thing. And the people that get hurt are just the everyday

08:56.100 --> 09:01.080
people that don't want to get in trouble. And they believe that they owe someone a thousand

09:01.080 --> 09:04.220
dollars. Cause they said, someone calls them on the phone and says, you owe us a thousand

09:04.220 --> 09:06.280
dollars. They're like, Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. And we pay you back.

09:06.420 --> 09:11.340
Um, and those that don't and say, no, I don't, um, I don't owe you money. They get,

09:11.340 --> 09:17.040
um, stocked up to the point where they're like, what happened to Andrew and say, well,

09:17.040 --> 09:21.800
we're going to come over and rape your wife. Shit like that. Right. And it gets bad. It's

09:21.800 --> 09:24.080
really bad. And it's rampant.

09:24.080 --> 09:30.680
If I, if I, if I understand it correctly, um, Kurt Weldon, who's a congressman, is he

09:30.680 --> 09:32.540
a, uh, past reps?

09:33.040 --> 09:38.360
Again, uh, do you have a computer? Hold on. Let me just load up my computer. Um, again,

09:38.460 --> 09:41.160
Kurt might not be the right, Kurt could be the wrong name.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.380
Oh, I can look them. I can look them up later. If you don't, I'm just trying to get as many

09:45.380 --> 09:50.040
details as I can. That's okay. I got my computer. So it's okay. It's working on her. I mean,

09:50.040 --> 09:54.320
I'm, I'm looking at futures tanking right now, so I just don't want to go on this computer

09:54.320 --> 09:59.440
cause I want to watch myself lose more money today. But hold on a second. It was a really

09:59.440 --> 10:05.300
bad idea. The fucking Dow Jones just went through the roof. Um, right after Trump's COVID thing,

10:05.380 --> 10:12.600
I thought it was going to go down. So that was bad. Um, let me see here. Weldon. Um, I have

10:12.600 --> 10:20.380
notes on it. Welding and machine money laundering. Oh man. Oh, can you guys, if I, if I ever

10:20.380 --> 10:27.280
do work for you guys, can you give me a new computer? I mean, we're, we're talking about

10:27.280 --> 10:32.280
a lot of you. No, I'm sorry. Just the damn thing to shut down on me. Hold on. I need a

10:32.280 --> 10:37.380
new battery. Um, yeah, there's a lot here. There's a lot here. Um, and it's, this is, I've,

10:37.480 --> 10:41.780
I got the bottom of the food chain. Well, actually more of a middle manager guy. Uh, the bottom

10:41.780 --> 10:46.260
of the food chain would be the guys that collect the money. But this, uh, the guy I just met,

10:46.260 --> 10:52.960
um, well, not just met, but, uh, just, uh, in talking about now, Rick Cohen is a middle

10:52.960 --> 11:01.440
manager. Um, so the higher up guys would be the Russian, um, the Russian sort of on paper,

11:01.520 --> 11:04.840
the owners of the different companies. And it's all actually at the end of the day, it

11:04.840 --> 11:09.860
all goes to one company, one, but it looks like there's a lot of different companies. So

11:09.860 --> 11:15.520
they have a monopoly on it as well. And Weldon is the guy that allows this to happen. Weldon

11:15.520 --> 11:22.280
and, and, so, is he Weldon in Congress? He might be Congressman. I think he's not a

11:22.280 --> 11:27.700
Senator, but I could be wrong. Oh, Congressman Weldon, Florida. Kurt, it is Kurt. I was right.

11:27.840 --> 11:35.880
Kurt Weldon. Okay. Kurt, Wayne Curtis Weldon. Yeah. Um, wait, there's a Senator, Senate

11:35.880 --> 11:39.760
Judiciary Committee investigating Kurt Weldon. Okay. So they started investigating him in

11:39.760 --> 11:46.260
2018, but that never went anywhere with an FBI probe. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, that's right.

11:46.300 --> 11:50.860
And the Atlantic, I'm going to forward you this article from the Atlantic. It's good. Um,

11:50.860 --> 11:58.660
but the guy you want to talk to, who's got extensive notes is Andrew. He is the man on this

11:58.660 --> 12:03.520
and he, I don't know if he wants to tell you though. Um, but I will ask him. I'll ask him

12:03.520 --> 12:11.460
first. Um, are you still there? Oh, I just got a missed call from you. What the hell? Oh, my phone

12:11.460 --> 12:15.980
died. Shit. I'm talking to myself now. Hold on. I mean, why am I telling you to hold on? You're not

12:15.980 --> 12:18.980
even on the phone? All right.

12:18.980 --> 12:22.980
Tch, tch, tch, tch.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.980
Okay.

12:45.980 --> 13:15.080
Tch, tch, tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch, tch. Tch, tch, tch, tch. tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch tch. Tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch. Tch. Tch, tch.

13:15.080 --> 13:45.060
Thank you.

13:45.080 --> 14:15.060
Thank you.

14:15.080 --> 14:45.060
Thank you.

14:45.080 --> 15:15.060
Thank you.

15:15.080 --> 15:45.060
Thank you.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.080
Thank you.
