WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
but uh...

00:01.920 --> 00:05.000
i don't know if we just have a bad lawyer

00:05.000 --> 00:08.460
i don't know that means being that made me think of you know because

00:08.460 --> 00:10.280
if you can get this thing just

00:10.280 --> 00:14.520
to go away drop whatever you can save us some money with his lawyer

00:14.520 --> 00:15.960
in the in the energy

00:15.960 --> 00:17.000
misery

00:17.000 --> 00:18.880
i don't like lawyers

00:18.880 --> 00:19.480
uh...

00:19.480 --> 00:21.440
i don't know why if that makes you feel any better

00:21.440 --> 00:24.000
it doesn't deal with the fair amount of them unfortunately

00:24.000 --> 00:26.240
yeah it's no fun

00:26.240 --> 00:28.640
i hear you man

00:28.640 --> 00:32.720
uh... i am looking into a couple things uh...

00:32.720 --> 00:38.400
so uh... to answer your question uh... you said you wanted to talk to uh... your lawyer mike

00:38.400 --> 00:40.080
yeah what uh...

00:40.080 --> 00:42.640
what would it be that you'd want to tell them

00:42.640 --> 00:44.800
well i think it would be great to

00:44.800 --> 00:47.000
tell him that uh...

00:47.000 --> 00:52.880
like he says that basically what we decided after speaking with you is that uh...

00:52.880 --> 00:56.120
and you know what i fucked up after so all my life i thought erroneous meant

00:56.120 --> 00:57.600
uh... arbitrary

00:57.600 --> 01:00.160
i guess erroneous means wrong and accurate

01:00.160 --> 01:04.640
so uh... so sabba's uh... this woman's testimony this ridiculous thing she

01:04.640 --> 01:05.800
put together

01:05.800 --> 01:10.120
uh... it's very bizarre as everyone is said including the judge

01:10.120 --> 01:11.240
uh... you there

01:11.240 --> 01:12.720
yeah

01:12.720 --> 01:14.120
oh no can you hear me now

01:14.120 --> 01:16.240
how about this

01:16.240 --> 01:19.040
uh... about the sabba's erroneous uh... report

01:19.040 --> 01:24.040
right right she's saying that now the erroneous uh... the fbis uh... report was

01:24.040 --> 01:25.640
erroneous

01:25.640 --> 01:30.240
this is what he said and he we need so he needs uh... tim and jammy

01:30.240 --> 01:32.560
and you since you spoke to uh...

01:32.560 --> 01:35.960
you know tim and jammy could i guess verify or vouch

01:35.960 --> 01:38.240
uh... is you are not the guy

01:38.240 --> 01:40.800
uh... you did not speak to sabba

01:40.800 --> 01:42.160
and uh...

01:42.160 --> 01:44.440
this is a little bit maybe

01:44.440 --> 01:46.400
i'm not sure it's my connection or

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
i don't know

01:47.400 --> 01:48.680
mine i'm driving so

01:48.680 --> 01:50.000
oh you're driving

01:50.000 --> 01:53.680
uh... you were saying tim and jammy's

01:54.600 --> 01:58.920
yes so tim so as we figured out last night uh... tim never spoke to sabba

01:58.920 --> 01:59.520
okay

01:59.520 --> 02:03.080
so she wrote and she wrote down that she directly spoke to tim

02:03.080 --> 02:04.040
uh...

02:04.040 --> 02:06.800
so that's a problem that's erroneous and that's it

02:06.800 --> 02:07.440
that's it

02:07.440 --> 02:10.920
i don't know if she did or not

02:10.920 --> 02:13.240
i don't know if she talked to tim

02:13.240 --> 02:15.000
i know that i've never talked to him

02:15.000 --> 02:17.440
that you never... right you're the one that

02:17.440 --> 02:20.080
right this is as long as you tell him you never speak spoke to any of these

02:20.080 --> 02:21.840
people that'd be great

02:21.840 --> 02:24.200
uh... maybe ask him what you could

02:24.200 --> 02:29.040
if there's what does he need what could he do to help to have this go away now

02:29.040 --> 02:32.880
uh... and suss him out and he spoke with more lawyers and i probably have

02:32.880 --> 02:36.560
this guy want money is this guy trying to drag this thing out to get more money

02:36.560 --> 02:38.720
or is he uh...

02:38.720 --> 02:41.160
a good lawyer i don't know what do you think

02:41.160 --> 02:45.680
uh... and then also like he's trying to call jim and timmy to get them to say

02:45.680 --> 02:49.440
we never spoke with sabba this is uh... someone made this shit up

02:49.440 --> 02:52.640
and had he done that i think this morning and jim and timmy had picked up the

02:52.640 --> 02:53.400
phone

02:53.400 --> 02:59.840
i don't think there'd be a case

02:59.840 --> 03:02.840
let me see this

03:02.840 --> 03:06.240
remember what we talked about at first was that we need to keep

03:06.240 --> 03:09.320
specifically my involvement

03:09.320 --> 03:12.560
and i haven't told anybody

03:12.560 --> 03:16.640
and i didn't think you would but the thing is if i tell your lawyer

03:16.640 --> 03:19.280
your lawyer is also under no obligation to

03:19.280 --> 03:23.640
not put my name everywhere and put in court documents that are publicly available

03:23.640 --> 03:24.800
and things like that

03:24.800 --> 03:28.680
so that's what we have to be careful on how we want to address it

03:28.680 --> 03:32.760
uh... more than likely what i would do since he already talked to tim

03:32.760 --> 03:36.720
i may have tim talked to him on my behalf or something like that or clarify

03:36.720 --> 03:38.560
something

03:38.560 --> 03:40.840
because tim's investigation is already

03:40.840 --> 03:45.520
what it is and there's articles written about it and your guys or whatever right now

03:45.520 --> 03:46.520
there's nothing

03:46.520 --> 03:48.920
covert about what tim's doing

03:48.920 --> 03:50.320
if i call him and i say hey

03:50.320 --> 03:53.440
my name is david and i've never talked to this lady sabba and he's gonna be like

03:53.440 --> 03:55.200
well who the hell are you

03:55.200 --> 03:59.440
i'll say well i'm the agent of houston and like well why is he talking, why are you talking about?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.800
and then he's like well you know

04:01.800 --> 04:03.400
it leads down a lot of

04:03.400 --> 04:04.400
of course

04:04.400 --> 04:05.800
we don't want to go down

04:05.800 --> 04:11.040
i'm just going off the plateau we hit last night when he said give me the

04:11.040 --> 04:15.000
lawyer's number and perhaps you could call him if you come up with an idea so i thought

04:15.000 --> 04:18.760
this would be a good chance

04:18.760 --> 04:22.000
uh... i never got the lawyer's number

04:22.000 --> 04:26.600
either i didn't write it down but usually if he tells me i write it maybe i said it and

04:26.600 --> 04:27.320
he kind of like

04:27.320 --> 04:29.120
oh no i never got it

04:29.120 --> 04:30.520
i texted it to you

04:30.520 --> 04:32.320
did you not receive the text yeah

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
oh no

04:33.320 --> 04:35.320
let me take my text

04:35.320 --> 04:37.000
i just picked my notes but i didn't see it

04:37.000 --> 04:39.880
but uh... i'll double check my text again

04:39.880 --> 04:42.960
yeah that would be a big problem if you're not getting these texts then they're going

04:42.960 --> 04:44.960
to somebody else and that's not good i've got you

04:44.960 --> 04:47.160
right here i'm talking to you now

04:47.160 --> 04:49.000
and i've texted it to

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
uh... let me just double check

04:52.000 --> 04:53.120
two eight one

04:53.120 --> 04:56.400
two eight one four one four six two three three

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
yeah that's it

04:57.400 --> 04:58.640
okay good

04:58.640 --> 05:02.800
and by the way the uh...

05:02.800 --> 05:07.920
congratulations on congressional medal of bravery that's amazing

05:07.920 --> 05:08.920
it's very amazing

05:08.920 --> 05:11.480
yeah unfortunately that's all out there yeah i know

05:11.480 --> 05:13.480
pretty cool though man pretty cool

05:13.480 --> 05:15.360
i felt a lot more confident when i read that

05:15.360 --> 05:16.920
very good

05:16.920 --> 05:18.800
top marks for you

05:18.800 --> 05:22.680
that was something that we didn't really deserve to get we're just doing our job and there's

05:22.680 --> 05:23.920
lots of other people who did

05:23.920 --> 05:26.120
a lot more than i did i'll tell you that right now

05:26.120 --> 05:27.280
yeah well said

05:27.280 --> 05:28.760
good answer

05:28.760 --> 05:30.000
good answer

05:30.000 --> 05:31.960
um but yeah okay

05:31.960 --> 05:33.760
yeah please let me know

05:33.760 --> 05:37.080
yeah i'll double check some stuff i'm still doing some things so

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
like i said what

05:38.080 --> 05:40.400
i'll probably come up with is

05:40.400 --> 05:45.800
i'll have to find out what it is that we need to do to resolve the court situation

05:45.800 --> 05:48.240
which unfortunately is not an easy list

05:48.240 --> 05:51.240
just for my, i don't know, the day of

05:51.240 --> 05:53.920
digging around and trying to figure things out

05:53.920 --> 05:56.280
uh... it's not going to be something that's going to be resolved overnight

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
i know

05:57.280 --> 05:59.240
i can only be honest with you

05:59.240 --> 06:02.680
right i can't promise you the world if i can't give it to you

06:02.680 --> 06:05.800
sure and i appreciate that

06:05.800 --> 06:09.120
and uh... so right now i'm looking at things trying to figure out what

06:09.120 --> 06:11.360
uh... what our best

06:11.360 --> 06:12.880
get so to speak

06:12.880 --> 06:13.720
uh...

06:13.720 --> 06:15.160
did you know

06:15.160 --> 06:18.640
did you know there's no due process in this court system this this dependency

06:18.640 --> 06:20.400
court in this dcv

06:20.400 --> 06:24.640
yeah it's a civil process which is different than a criminal process

06:24.640 --> 06:27.040
uh... so criminal processes you know

06:27.040 --> 06:30.320
it's beyond a reasonable doubt and that's the standard for conviction

06:30.320 --> 06:32.560
civil court cases it's uh...

06:32.560 --> 06:35.040
preponderance of the evidence i believe so

06:35.040 --> 06:36.360
well but there was no evidence

06:36.360 --> 06:39.640
you can go now you can actually go in with pure hearsay and this is what the

06:39.640 --> 06:44.080
lawyer just just prove to us pure hearsay the neighbors can go say yes uh...

06:44.080 --> 06:48.440
you know uh... these guys are these guys are shaving chipmunks every you know

06:48.440 --> 06:51.000
that's what they do they shave chipmunks and they sell the hair

06:51.000 --> 06:55.080
and then there's no proof for evidence but they have to accept that as fact

06:55.080 --> 06:57.480
the judge has to accept it as fact

06:57.480 --> 06:58.800
or as true

06:58.800 --> 06:59.520
i don't think

06:59.520 --> 07:02.440
well i don't think they have to accept it as fact but

07:02.760 --> 07:06.440
the standard for evidence is a lot looser i know what you mean

07:06.440 --> 07:09.800
in other words it just doesn't have to believe that that's true because obviously

07:09.800 --> 07:11.240
you've got all sorts like

07:11.240 --> 07:13.880
unfortunately like i said i've dealt with this before

07:13.880 --> 07:17.320
you know crazy ex-spouses claim all sorts of stupid shit

07:17.320 --> 07:18.280
and

07:18.280 --> 07:20.440
luckily for the most part

07:20.440 --> 07:22.680
uh... we can kind of cut through some of the bullshit

07:22.680 --> 07:24.600
but

07:24.600 --> 07:28.760
but what we'll talk about on wednesday is just trying to figure out if there's

07:28.760 --> 07:31.400
you know anything else that we should know about

07:31.400 --> 07:33.160
you know when we go and talk to them because

07:33.160 --> 07:35.080
i don't want to look like a chapped ass if

07:35.080 --> 07:35.560
you know

07:35.560 --> 07:37.880
if we put a neck out on the line and say hey

07:37.880 --> 07:38.600
you know

07:38.600 --> 07:40.680
this is this is we know that valk

07:40.680 --> 07:43.560
guy and he's not a serial killer and turns out you know okay i got

07:43.560 --> 07:45.240
10 chopped up kids in the back truck you know

07:45.240 --> 07:47.240
yeah yeah i got you

07:47.240 --> 07:48.120
of course yeah

07:48.120 --> 07:51.640
so uh but that's why on on wednesday we're gonna talk a little bit more

07:51.640 --> 07:52.680
depth about that

07:52.680 --> 07:53.480
about

07:53.480 --> 07:55.000
what you can tell us because

07:55.000 --> 07:57.960
you know the thing the other reason i uh is marina room right now

07:57.960 --> 07:59.960

we talk about everything i mean i know she knows every every inch of my life

09:53.640 --> 09:57.480
and i know every inch of her life and it becomes familiarity breeds contempt

09:57.480 --> 09:59.880
as you know

09:59.880 --> 10:01.880
so

yeah

10:41.800 --> 10:45.400
that's what i figured yeah that's what i figured i'll have to give her a

10:45.400 --> 10:49.400
different story though um i'm really bad at lying to her i can lie

10:49.400 --> 10:53.160
really well to everyone else but not to her i so i have to figure out

10:53.160 --> 10:59.400
half-truth

10:59.400 --> 11:05.400
yeah

11:07.000 --> 11:13.400

12:12.120 --> 12:15.560
investigator assigned to our case and he's gonna investigate us

12:15.560 --> 12:19.080
um they've already spoken with M-[Redacted] and M-[Redacted]e loves me and he keeps telling

12:19.080 --> 12:23.880
him how much they love me so that's the good news and then to steve chagrin he

12:23.880 --> 12:28.280
does not like to hear that at all um but it's really nice it was really nice

12:28.280 --> 12:31.720
to hear the psychiatrist say M-[Redacted] just loves val

12:31.720 --> 12:37.000
um so that's really good and then and there's uh uh what else is there

12:37.000 --> 12:43.240
so the so the judge i can't see or talk to M-[Redacted] until

12:43.240 --> 12:46.920
i get special permission from the judge or the hearing that's pissing me off

12:47.000 --> 12:50.680
that's like horrible and the thing that's five weeks from now

12:51.240 --> 12:55.000
i'm not allowed to speak because of the allegations i'm not allowed to speak

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
to M-[Redacted] or even see him on the court well marie's allowed to see him three

12:59.000 --> 13:02.680
times a week i can't even see him i can't even talk to him on the phone

13:02.680 --> 13:08.440
i know i know it's not nice it's we're crying it was terrible it was just

13:08.440 --> 13:19.960
terrible

13:29.160 --> 13:33.960
and uh yeah she or he will deliver a report of some sort and uh the the report

13:33.960 --> 13:37.880
will go to the judge and then the hearing will be based on that report the next

13:37.960 --> 13:51.400
step yeah

13:58.840 --> 14:03.400
okay

yeah it is yeah it's exactly what they told what the our lawyer told the judge

14:29.720 --> 14:33.160
and but the judge i was so frustrated to hear the judge has to take that

14:33.960 --> 14:39.640
by law has to accept that report and that's and they must have known that shaba and the

14:39.640 --> 14:43.880
others must have known that which is why they made it so severe i mean i do you still do you

14:43.880 --> 14:50.200
mean to send i was i'm happy to send it to you but keep in mind it is ridiculous okay i just

14:50.200 --> 14:54.280

14:54.280 --> 15:05.640
