1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
but uh...

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,000
i don't know if we just have a bad lawyer

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,460
i don't know that means being that made me think of you know because

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,280
if you can get this thing just

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,520
to go away drop whatever you can save us some money with his lawyer

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,960
in the in the energy

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,000
misery

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,880
i don't like lawyers

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,480
uh...

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,440
i don't know why if that makes you feel any better

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,000
it doesn't deal with the fair amount of them unfortunately

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,240
yeah it's no fun

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,640
i hear you man

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,720
uh... i am looking into a couple things uh...

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,400
so uh... to answer your question uh... you said you wanted to talk to uh... your lawyer mike

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,080
yeah what uh...

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,640
what would it be that you'd want to tell them

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,800
well i think it would be great to

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,000
tell him that uh...

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,880
like he says that basically what we decided after speaking with you is that uh...

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,120
and you know what i fucked up after so all my life i thought erroneous meant

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,600
uh... arbitrary

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
i guess erroneous means wrong and accurate

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,640
so uh... so sabba's uh... this woman's testimony this ridiculous thing she

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,800
put together

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,120
uh... it's very bizarre as everyone is said including the judge

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,240
uh... you there

28
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,720
yeah

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,120
oh no can you hear me now

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,240
how about this

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
uh... about the sabba's erroneous uh... report

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,040
right right she's saying that now the erroneous uh... the fbis uh... report was

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,640
erroneous

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,240
this is what he said and he we need so he needs uh... tim and jammy

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
and you since you spoke to uh...

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,960
you know tim and jammy could i guess verify or vouch

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,240
uh... is you are not the guy

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,800
uh... you did not speak to sabba

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,160
and uh...

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,440
this is a little bit maybe

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,400
i'm not sure it's my connection or

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
i don't know

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,680
mine i'm driving so

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
oh you're driving

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
uh... you were saying tim and jammy's

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,920
yes so tim so as we figured out last night uh... tim never spoke to sabba

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,520
okay

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,080
so she wrote and she wrote down that she directly spoke to tim

49
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,040
uh...

50
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,800
so that's a problem that's erroneous and that's it

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,440
that's it

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,920
i don't know if she did or not

53
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,240
i don't know if she talked to tim

54
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,000
i know that i've never talked to him

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,440
that you never... right you're the one that

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,080
right this is as long as you tell him you never speak spoke to any of these

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
people that'd be great

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,200
uh... maybe ask him what you could

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,040
if there's what does he need what could he do to help to have this go away now

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,880
uh... and suss him out and he spoke with more lawyers and i probably have

61
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,560
this guy want money is this guy trying to drag this thing out to get more money

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
or is he uh...

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,160
a good lawyer i don't know what do you think

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,680
uh... and then also like he's trying to call jim and timmy to get them to say

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
we never spoke with sabba this is uh... someone made this shit up

66
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,640
and had he done that i think this morning and jim and timmy had picked up the

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,400
phone

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,840
i don't think there'd be a case

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
let me see this

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,240
remember what we talked about at first was that we need to keep

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,320
specifically my involvement

72
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,560
and i haven't told anybody

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
and i didn't think you would but the thing is if i tell your lawyer

74
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,280
your lawyer is also under no obligation to

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,640
not put my name everywhere and put in court documents that are publicly available

76
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,800
and things like that

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,680
so that's what we have to be careful on how we want to address it

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,760
uh... more than likely what i would do since he already talked to tim

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,720
i may have tim talked to him on my behalf or something like that or clarify

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
something

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,840
because tim's investigation is already

82
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,520
what it is and there's articles written about it and your guys or whatever right now

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
there's nothing

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,920
covert about what tim's doing

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,320
if i call him and i say hey

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,440
my name is david and i've never talked to this lady sabba and he's gonna be like

87
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,200
well who the hell are you

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,440
i'll say well i'm the agent of houston and like well why is he talking, why are you talking about?

89
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,800
and then he's like well you know

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
it leads down a lot of

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
of course

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,800
we don't want to go down

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,040
i'm just going off the plateau we hit last night when he said give me the

94
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,000
lawyer's number and perhaps you could call him if you come up with an idea so i thought

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,760
this would be a good chance

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,000
uh... i never got the lawyer's number

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,600
either i didn't write it down but usually if he tells me i write it maybe i said it and

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,320
he kind of like

99
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,120
oh no i never got it

100
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,520
i texted it to you

101
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,320
did you not receive the text yeah

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
oh no

103
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
let me take my text

104
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,000
i just picked my notes but i didn't see it

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,880
but uh... i'll double check my text again

106
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,960
yeah that would be a big problem if you're not getting these texts then they're going

107
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
to somebody else and that's not good i've got you

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,160
right here i'm talking to you now

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,000
and i've texted it to

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
uh... let me just double check

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,120
two eight one

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
two eight one four one four six two three three

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
yeah that's it

114
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
okay good

115
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,800
and by the way the uh...

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,920
congratulations on congressional medal of bravery that's amazing

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920

118
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,480
yeah unfortunately that's all out there yeah i know

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
pretty cool though man pretty cool

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,360
i felt a lot more confident when i read that

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
very good

122
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,800
top marks for you

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,680
that was something that we didn't really deserve to get we're just doing our job and there's

124
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
lots of other people who did

125
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,120
a lot more than i did i'll tell you that right now

126
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,280
yeah well said

127
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,760
good answer

128
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,000
good answer

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,960
um but yeah okay

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,760
yeah please let me know

131
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,080
yeah i'll double check some stuff i'm still doing some things so

132
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
like i said what

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
i'll probably come up with is

134
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,800
i'll have to find out what it is that we need to do to resolve the court situation

135
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,240
which unfortunately is not an easy list

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,240
just for my, i don't know, the day of

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,920
digging around and trying to figure things out

138
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,280
uh... it's not going to be something that's going to be resolved overnight

139
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
i know

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,240
i can only be honest with you

141
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,680
right i can't promise you the world if i can't give it to you

142
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,800
sure and i appreciate that

143
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,120
and uh... so right now i'm looking at things trying to figure out what

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,360
uh... what our best

145
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
get so to speak

146
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,720
uh...

147
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,160
did you know

148
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,640
did you know there's no due process in this court system this this dependency

149
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,400
court in this dcv

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,640
yeah it's a civil process which is different than a criminal process

151
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,040
uh... so criminal processes you know

152
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,320
it's beyond a reasonable doubt and that's the standard for conviction

153
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,560
civil court cases it's uh...

154
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,040
preponderance of the evidence i believe so

155
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,360
well but there was no evidence

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,640
you can go now you can actually go in with pure hearsay and this is what the

157
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,080
lawyer just just prove to us pure hearsay the neighbors can go say yes uh...

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,440
you know uh... these guys are these guys are shaving chipmunks every you know

159
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,000
that's what they do they shave chipmunks and they sell the hair

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,080
and then there's no proof for evidence but they have to accept that as fact

161
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,480
the judge has to accept it as fact

162
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,800
or as true

163
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,520
i don't think

164
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,440
well i don't think they have to accept it as fact but

165
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,440
the standard for evidence is a lot looser i know what you mean

166
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,800
in other words it just doesn't have to believe that that's true because obviously

167
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,240
you've got all sorts like

168
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,880
unfortunately like i said i've dealt with this before

169
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,320
you know crazy ex-spouses claim all sorts of stupid shit

170
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,280
and

171
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,440
luckily for the most part

172
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,680
uh... we can kind of cut through some of the bullshit

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,600
but

174
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,760
but what we'll talk about on wednesday is just trying to figure out if there's

175
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,400
you know anything else that we should know about

176
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,160
you know when we go and talk to them because

177
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,080
i don't want to look like a chapped ass if

178
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,560

we talk about everything i mean i know she knows every every inch of my life

229
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,400
different story though um i'm really bad at lying to her i can lie

230
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,160
really well to everyone else but not to her i so i have to figure out

231
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,400
half-truth

232
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,400

236
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:47,400
that's a good idea

237
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,400
understood completely yes

238
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,400
okay

239
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,560
yeah well

240
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,120
september 29th is the next hearing um there's gonna be an

241
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,560
investigator assigned to our case and he's gonna investigate us

242
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,080
um they've already spoken with M-[Redacted] and M-[Redacted]e loves me and he keeps telling

243
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,880
him how much they love me so that's the good news and then to steve chagrin he

244
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,280
does not like to hear that at all um but it's really nice it was really nice

245
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,720
to hear the psychiatrist say M-[Redacted] just loves val

246
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,000
um so that's really good and then and there's uh uh what else is there

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,240
so the so the judge i can't see or talk to M-[Redacted] until

248
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,920
i get special permission from the judge or the hearing that's pissing me off

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,680
that's like horrible and the thing that's five weeks from now

250
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,000
i'm not allowed to speak because of the allegations i'm not allowed to speak

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
to M-[Redacted] or even see him on the court well marie's allowed to see him three

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,680
times a week i can't even see him i can't even talk to him on the phone

253
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,440
i know i know it's not nice it's we're crying it was terrible it was just

254
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:19,960
terrible

255
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,960
and uh yeah she or he will deliver a report of some sort and uh the the report

256
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,880
will go to the judge and then the hearing will be based on that report the next

257
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:51,400
step yeah

258
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,400
okay

259
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,920
sure right

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,920
be great

261
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,720
yeah it is yeah it's exactly what they told what the our lawyer told the judge

262
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,160
and but the judge i was so frustrated to hear the judge has to take that

263
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,640
by law has to accept that report and that's and they must have known that shaba and the

264
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,880
others must have known that which is why they made it so severe i mean i do you still do you

265
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,200
mean to send i was i'm happy to send it to you but keep in mind it is ridiculous okay i just

266
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,280
worry i'm gonna be judged by this report that's why i'm afraid to show it to anyone because it's

267
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:05,640
so absurd um like like it's yeah it's it's yeah because you you seem like a clever guy
