00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Right now. Good.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Where are my phones?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Uh-huh. Where am I?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Deployed.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Deployed.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Oh, why don't you take these out for a second?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
One, two, three.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I don't think I like these jeans.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
They're really great.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Yeah, very.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, especially when we run the run.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Okay.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Thank you, baby.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
You're kind of...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Normal guy.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Normal guy?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, good.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Cool.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Cool style.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Like, very stylish.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Nice.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Okay.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I don't...

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I don't wear this stuff.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Okay.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Huh?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, my cigarette.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, yeah, my check.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I need that mask.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Okay.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
And my cigarette loaves.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
What are you using now?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Uh, later.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Like a small one.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh, I think I have one in my bag, actually.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh, perfect.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
This one scares me.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
No.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
That's not good.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You can put that somewhere else.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
One, two, three.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Courage, huh?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Do you want to give me back all the other stuff?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
The, um...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
The bad greeners?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Do you want that back?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah, this one.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I can't do this one.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Is it bad?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I can't do this.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I don't know if it's...

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It's good.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
It's good?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
It's beautiful.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, that's beautiful.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
You...

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I'm gonna picture you in your beauty.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Okay.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Wow.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Okay.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
That's all.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
That's all.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Um...

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Maybe you can meet me if you come downstairs now.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Why don't you go by the building?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Come here.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Come here.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
No, no, in front of the building.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Just get in there.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Just...

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Just get your best friend in the building, please.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Why are you both doing that with your top?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
That would be that, no.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
This is not France in 1992.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Both shoulders off.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That's better.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
That's what I'm talking about.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
What?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm telling you to come down and meet me.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
See, he's supposed to come down and meet me.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You have to sneak me in, remember?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
He's heading down now.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So, I'll say Marie wants me...

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Do you do well?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Do you need to do well?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yes, I do.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm saying you just want to briefly meet him and say hi.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Sure.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Okay.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Sure.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I'll miss you.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
We'll keep you.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
You want me to put some of this on this guy?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
He's covered in this.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Okay.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm going to tell him we're outside in the parking lot.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
You said it's cool to meet him, you can meet him.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
We're outside in the parking lot.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Drop off your air.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, too.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Drop off your air.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Red Mini, you can't do this here.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Where is it?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Here.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
What's up?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Where is that?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm worried.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Aw, thank you.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Perfect.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, yes.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Good idea, baby.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
What?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
That's a good one.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I like the pie.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Nice.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Okay.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You're not switching too much.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I am so hot.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
There will be air con inside.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
My story.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
It's a cool thing because it's like an internet joint.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Look.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Super elegant.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
You look super cool.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Super stylish.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Super fashionable.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I like it.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I need you.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
It's the best thing.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Not as bad as me.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Do you want one of these or do you have another one?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Yes, good.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Well done.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Perfect.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Good, good, good.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
That's what I'm talking about.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Smart.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
See you again.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Thank you so much.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Thank you.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I'll give myself a bit.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Pipe.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
That's what you can't use.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
You have a band on your arm.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Is it your boyfriend?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Is it your husband?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Is it your boyfriend?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
No, no, no.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Is it your controlling boyfriend?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
They looked at me.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
They were like...

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Who?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Nothing.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
What was the thing?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
You have a band.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I just...

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I did not know what it was to me.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Look, what did they...

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Is it like...

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
No, I was cooking and...

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
They mean anything about it?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
No, no.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
They just looked at me and looked at me and looked at me.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Okay.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Hello.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
How's my hair?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
It's okay.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
What's it?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
It's okay.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Don't worry about it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It just makes my hair look a little stupid.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
It's okay.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
It's weird.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
It's okay?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
We need some sun.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I know.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
We need some sunglasses.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh my God, yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Maybe we can do that today.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Oh, can you make appointments at the Apple Store for us?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Soon after your...

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Your thing, we can go directly to the Apple Store.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
You get a new pair of glasses.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
We can go directly to the Apple Store.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
You get a new phone.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So we're not being hacked by everybody.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes, you do, because you're hacked by everybody.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Okay.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
No, but in your ear.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Oh, yeah?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Did you get them?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I don't...

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I'm sorry.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
What are you doing?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
No, but they're in there.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, okay.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I know, it's annoying, but...

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Not helpful.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
It's really loud.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
It's really, really super loud, baby.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm sorry.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You just can't blow my ears like that.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
All right, so where are the plans today?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Today's plans.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
You're gonna do this.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Y'all on goes.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
You might pick me up.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
You might not.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
So I'll take Uber and then go to...

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, shit.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Oh, no.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I left it inside.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah, I need my keys.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Oh, there's the Fanta.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
The pineapple Fanta?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Ah.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Wonderful.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Thank you.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Perfect.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Oh, no.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
One, two, three.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I got it.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Do you have to go?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah, well, he's gonna come.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
All right?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
I told him Red Mini, you can't miss us.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Good night.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah, just leave it here.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Put on the hazards.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Put the hazards on.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Nice.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Lock it, yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Mr. Reed.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Mr. Reed.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Mr. Reed.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Hello, Mr. Reed.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
There are four lights.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Do you have the lights on?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah, running.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
It's going right now.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
What about this back?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
See the back?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
It sticks out?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't have the key.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
No.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I don't have the key back.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I don't have the key.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I don't have the key.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Are you sure?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I don't know.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I don't know.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
You can fix that.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
You did great.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You did great.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, here we are.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Hello.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Hey.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
It's Daniel.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
David.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
David Koh.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Nice to meet you.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Cheers.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
This is Mary High.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm sorry?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I'm sorry.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, good play.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
All right, Bo.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Nice to meet you.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah, good to be here.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm sorry.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm sorry.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Remember I spoke the other night?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
It's all right?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
It's all right.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
It's all right.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
She almost killed me like five times getting here.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
She's French and a woman.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
She's got two cliches against her.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
French and a woman.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Well, there's your first go.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Enjoy.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Enjoy.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I got it.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
I got it.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh, careful.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Remember to shake on my back.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Thank you.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
All right, guys.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Thanks.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
How's it going?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Good, good.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Boeing.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Is that your name, is that it?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Like the...

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, where's my mask?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
The company, right?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Look at it.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Do your parents...

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Is that the one staff that comes down?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh, my God.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
There was some, but not for LA.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Okay.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Really weird.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
So easy.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Cool.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, it was part of our strategy.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Lightened up a little bit.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Sorry I'm late, though.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, come on.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
It's like LA.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
You're from here.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
It's...

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
You're not from here.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
No, no, no.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Not me.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Not from here.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
We're going to get you a visitor, guys.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
What?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Is there a visitor?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Come on in, sir.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I have a photo of it.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
I need a physical ID, unless you guys are okay with that.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
This is actually my fault because I lost my drugs license a few days ago.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I don't know where it is.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
It's in a bookshelf.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
It's on my bookshelf.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
It's okay.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
You guys are okay with that?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Okay.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Just go ahead and place all your items here in the bin for me.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Okay.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay, now do you want to let you know you were entering the federal facility?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Okay, we are conducting.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Sir, one second.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Okay, listen to me.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm not done with this inspection, okay?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
We are inspecting for weapons and explosives.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You have nothing like that on you?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
No, I don't.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
You can still carry any tools, knives, pepper spray, nothing like that?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Okay.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Let's do your belt off.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh, great.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Okay.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
I'm going to have you take off your coat.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Sure.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Sure.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
No problem.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
You guys, what are you doing?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Do you have any electronics?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Okay.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
No, they're all in here.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Okay, put them separately, boss.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Separately from your bag.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Okay.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
You can put them right here with your document.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Put your document here.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Put your document right there, okay?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Okay.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I'll leave them in the bag.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
You want to take them out of there?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Take them out of there.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I brought some stuff.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
He said don't bring anything.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I thought you marked it.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I thought you were just being polite.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I brought a little stuff for you.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Okay.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Okay.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Okay.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
And nothing else on you?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Nope.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Okay.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Just go ahead and...

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Oh, wait.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't mean anything.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah, everything out of your pocket.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Okay?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
So you have nothing with your name on it?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I do.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
But I'll show it to you on my phone.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm going to have my wallet full of cards.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Oh, okay.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Just hang on to it for now, okay?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
That's fine.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Stand right over there, okay?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Give me one second.

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
One second.

11:46.000 --> 12:01.000
I didn't know how to play dirty support.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Okay.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Go ahead and walk through, sir.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Straight through, okay?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Okay.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
There we go.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Okay.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
You said you have a picture of your ID or something like that?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yes, I do.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Okay.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm going to give you...

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Just my recessions.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I want to see that because they can make you a badge.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Of course, sir.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Here's my phone.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Okay.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Give it to the receptionist.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Oh, wait.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
They're going to want my phone.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Okay.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Give it to the receptionist.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Give it to the receptionist.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Oh, wait.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
They're going to want my phone.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Okay.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Okay.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Give it to the receptionist.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh, wait.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
They're going to want my phone.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Okay.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Okay.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
What are the rules for the mask?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Keep it on.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
All times?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Sure.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Okay.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Okay.

12:39.000 --> 13:05.000
Ma'am, thank you for following me.

13:05.000 --> 13:15.000
It's much, much, much easier than it was last time I was here.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Sorry?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
This is me.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
It's new, huh?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
That's why.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
This used to be called a coffee.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Oh, yeah.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And there's a guy selling coffee over here, too.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Right?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
If that doesn't, I'm not going to go.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Anyway.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah, okay.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Is there still coffee inside?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
No.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh, do you need coffee?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm going to get some coffee.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I don't have to go through all this again, do I?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
No.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Okay.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
You guys want anything?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh, I'm good.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Okay.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
No?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Um, coffee.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Sorry.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Just, you know.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Do you need it on your bag?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I like that.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Yeah.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
It's a gift from Marie.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Oh, cool.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
She's a good friend.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
She's a good friend.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
She's, uh – she's learning.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
She's very jealous.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Really wanting to come and hang out with you guys.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Oh, yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
She's so married.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
She's like, but I speak eight languages.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
You know?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Eight.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Which languages?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Oh, uh, uh, English, I know, right?

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
English, Swiss, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Huh?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And I think she – uh, Chinese.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
I apologize, I think because of like Chinese pandemic stuff, usually they're coming here.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
Oh, oh really? In the break room upstairs to the floor?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, you know what there is.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh, perfect, okay.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Good morning gentlemen.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Good morning. We have a visitor here, and he's from...

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Thank you.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Cheers.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Can you see my partner?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Thanks.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
You guys want to do this again?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh, okay.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Thank you.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Thank you.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Cool.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Does everyone make fun?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Um...

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Really, huh?

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Yeah, usually you'll feel comfortable here because of your game console.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Oh, dang it.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
You know, I get to meet about a fun man or two different people.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I remember this tent floor.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I handed my stuff, we go to another one over there.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Exactly, same thing.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
And then what we just handled over there used to be handled on a tent floor.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So that girl's no longer working here?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
It's a floor lady?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh, it's always changing.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
She's so nice.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Super nice.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, that could be it.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Still not.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Are you guys there?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
So, some of you are special agents?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yep.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
And you are DC3?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Uh, I'm not...

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm not...

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
You know, I'm not part of their...

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Oh, no.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Their hierarchy.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
No, I'm not.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
It's not the...

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's the general hierarchy.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
In New York.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It's everything but Russia.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
DC3.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah, so it usually doesn't work in the same way.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
So different...

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Different to a lot of different things.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Cool.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Oh, there.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I see what you're saying.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
You remember that?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I do.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh, wait.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It's my natural that's supposed to...

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh, right.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Thanks.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Okay.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
What's going to do with it?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I wonder if we're all thoroughly...

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
What's going on?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Did you get a chance to...

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
There were four lights.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Clever.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I liked it.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I liked it.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I'd love you to get the reference.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Oh, I got it.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I got it.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
That's what it is.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
That's supposed to make a random number.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah, that's good.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I was surprised you spelled out four, though.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Oh, I think...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Because I never thought we'd take anything.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Oh, it was?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, okay.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah, that's how it is.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
It's good.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Well, you read the call of Winston.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
It's from Winston.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
And he's being tortured.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Right.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Writing in the floor.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
It's a portless floor.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
A two-plus-two-plus-four.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Interesting.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
No.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
That's the one where there are five lights.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
And he makes cards saying that there are four.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Oh, no.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
He makes them say that there are five lights.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I know, but that's...

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
But it's taken from 1984?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yes.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Right after the record.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Right after the record.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Nice.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Cool.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
He probably grabbed all the stuff.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Okay.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Is there another room?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I think I might have a bigger...

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
No, it's okay.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I like the other side of the room.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Sorry, this side.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
That's a big one.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
It's gonna be good.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Hang on there.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I don't...

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Cool.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Well, this is...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
This is Thailand.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Thailand?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
How do you do it?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Nice to meet you.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Can I take a hand?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah, I know, it's a...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
The virtual way, right?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Sure, sure.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Patty, are you from Houston as well?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
No.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
LA?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
It's from LA.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Okay.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Do you like your coffee?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Lots of milk sugar.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Milk sugar?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Yes, please.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Can I take off my mask?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Good.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
We casual here?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Okay.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I have one.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Take it really.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I just can't get the frogs up my glasses.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You do it with your fogger.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
I know.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
You know?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I've got some people with a mask.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Oh, yeah.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I've got a clear one.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah, like a face shield.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
But now they're saying,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
oh, are you in the mask?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah, I think so.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Right, right.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
It's very, really.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Do you need both of them?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I don't know.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
There are some.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
There are some.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, that's a lot.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I can't wait for the last time.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I'm just gonna leave this.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Believe it or not,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Russia just did the other vaccine yesterday.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Of course they did.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I saw that.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I saw that too, right?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
It's propaganda.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
It's propaganda.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Oh, I'm sure.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I saw that too.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Thank you.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Good to care.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
So I'm so excited to hear what this is about.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't think I can take it anymore.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
It's like so thrilling.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I've got four guesses.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Can I guess?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Sure, you can guess it.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Okay.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Does it have to do...

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't think it has to do with things.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
It probably doesn't have to tell you.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
It doesn't make you feel like that.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
No, I'm just gonna double.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
All right, let me see if I can read you.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Based on my guesses.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I don't think it's related to banking.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Okay.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Okay.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I think it's related to hacking.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Okay.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I think it has something to do with Emma.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Okay.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
How am I?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I'm close?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I couldn't read you.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Well, no, you're getting a different one the first time.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Your eyes went to the right.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Usually, eyes up to the right,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
you're creating something.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Down to the left, it acts as a memory.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
So, everything I've read and studied about that

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
is actually co-pulsion.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
It is co-pulsion.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
You've got to know the person who does that.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
It is true.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
You've got to get a baseline with the person first.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Whatever.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
It's not like global.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Because you think about it,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
if that was true.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Every co-returnment,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
you'd be able to find out immediately

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
who's blocking the business.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
That's true.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
That's true.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Because detection of deception

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
is incredibly difficult, unfortunately.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Well, do you think so?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I think it's pretty easy.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It's a research issue.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
If you know how you are deceptive,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
then you will know how someone else is deceptive.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Except for certain type.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I would have to see.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Lisa?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
So, there's different types of liars, too.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
There's Machiavellian liars,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
who will lie just a lot.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
They'll lie because that's just what they did

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
every single day of their life.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Trump.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Then, on the other side of the world,

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
there's what you can call the Catholic school

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
boy or girl.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
They've grown up with a fear of lying,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
where anytime they lie,

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
they're like,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I just said that my name is David.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
What does he think my name is?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
The shame associated with guilt.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So, those are, yeah, exactly.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
So, those are two very distinctly different types of liars

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
who lie very distinctly different.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
So, for example, the Machiavellian liars

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
is harder to detect on the line.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Because it's constant lines.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
There's no baseline.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
And the opposite would be the Catholic school boy or girl

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
is harder to detect because they're constantly triggering.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, they honestly think that they're lying about something

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
even when they're not.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
What about the sort of desperate liars

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
that are trying to stay alive?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
That's what it means.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I've read a couple books on it,

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
and we've taken a couple classes.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah, that's what I was curious about in your classes.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Do they teach that?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Do they teach a chronicle or something?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Like, that's a thing that I'm sure

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
can be used to see someone's life

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and there are things that we'll do.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And there's things that I do

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
as part of my normal daily life.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Well, what I do is I ask you questions.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I know you'll post your name

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
when it's your birthday,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
because they're at low.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
No.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
And then I'll see how you react to the honest question.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And then I'll ask you something I know you don't know,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
and I'll see how you react to that.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And that's how I establish a baseline.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
That's my method, though.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
That's a good thing.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
That's how I do it.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
What about you?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
You have polygraph, huh?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
What's a polygraph?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
No, no, I'm not.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
I'm not.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
I'm never taking polygraph.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
I would like to if you guys weren't helping out.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
It'd be fun.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
But no, I just, you know,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I like people.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Well, actually, I hate people, but I like...

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I love and I hate people,

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
but I like to study things.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I don't know.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Very cool.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Very cool.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
That was nice of you,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
we're going to bring you down here.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Yeah.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I guess you can call me

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
if you want to head back out or something.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I'm sorry?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Do you have to give her a call?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
No, it's just got to work at one.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
So she said,

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
is you going to go out

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
and just to write this letter

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
into the judge?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, he got screwed over by his fucking lawyer.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
It's got to be Mike Kretzmer.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Mm-hmm.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
He went so far as to...

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
He emailed Jim and Tammy

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
saying,

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
I am Val's counsel.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I am Val's attorney.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm Val's attorney.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I'm Val's attorney.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Interesting.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah, because I saw your text this morning.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I saw that.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
You know, he said he'd like to represent you,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
but he's not, so...

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Yeah, we had to fire him.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
He was very condescending.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And there's something really wrong.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
You see, I thought it was in L.A.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I mean, it's like a mafia.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
They know each other

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
and they do whatever

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
the other person says.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
It's very disturbing.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
They want to mess it up however you want,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
but you have to have it.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
That's perfect.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Thank you.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Wonderful.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
All right.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Well, I tried to guess what this is all about.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
It says,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
nothing to do with banking.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Okay.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And I think that's something to do with hacking.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
And the name is Emma.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Oh, look.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I think I got the honor of being here.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You know what I mean?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
You know what I mean?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
You know what I mean?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Well, I mean, to the third guest.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Okay.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
No, no, no.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Another guest.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Interesting.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Who's the third guest?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
I think he's the fourth guest.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
No, no, no.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Okay.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Yes.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh, there's a guest.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
It's a match.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
It's a match.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
It's a problem.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Cool.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I guess, so,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
what we're here for is mainly to see

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
how we can help you, right?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Because we need to find out.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
So, you and I have talked,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I've talked with Patty and Bowling

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
about it lately,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
but you should probably

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
re-match a little bit about

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
what the situation is right now,

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
how the hearing went,

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
and everything else.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Just make sure that we're all on the same page.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Because like I told you,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
like, if we are going to be able to help,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
we have to know how we can help

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
and how best to help you.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Okay.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
That way, we can go forward.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
But at the same time,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
if you're going to help us,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
you also have to know,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
okay, well, is this going to be

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
dependent on something else?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Right.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Well, that's why,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
why don't you just tell me

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
first what you want.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
And then I'll go from there.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Well, I mean,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
the thing is like,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm not going to tell you

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
what exactly we want.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I'm telling you that right now.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I've already told you,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
on the phone,

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I'm giving you my word,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
because you, Tim and Jami,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
recommended you.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
I said,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
I'll help you if you need my help.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
No matter what.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Even if it's,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
even if it's not anything related

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
to you helping me,

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
I will help you the best

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
in my ability.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Okay.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Just because of Tim and Jami,

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
because I date,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
their word is very,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
they carry a lot with me.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
It goes far with me.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
So I've already told you that,

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
so I'll stick with that.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
You don't have to worry about

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
anything too transactional with me

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
right now.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Okay.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
If you guys are coming out here

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
to help me,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
that's great.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Okay.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I'll tell you,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
what do you need to know?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
The whole story from the beginning?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yep.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Different deal.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Okay.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Go.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Um.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Um.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't even know where to start

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
from the beginning.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Uh.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Okay.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
So,

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
you don't know my story though.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
It doesn't really matter, does it?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Um.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
You can't even trust it.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
You can't even trust it.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Oh, please don't read it.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
David Ennerinches article.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
It's terrible.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Um.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Okay.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
So Marie and I,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I'm that,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
you know,

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
you can't even trust it.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
You can't even trust it.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
You can't even trust it.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
You can't even trust it.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Marie and I met,

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
uh,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
because I thought she was a spy for my mom,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
and I thought she was spying on me.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
So I,

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
uh,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
confronted her,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
and she was,

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
uh,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
had a show in Australia

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
doing,

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
selling a bunch of,

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
uh,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
she had a personal,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
like her first cool show in Adeline,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I think,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
with her,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Sydney.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I don't remember.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
So,

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
um,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
she ends up,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
she knows my mother,

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
because my mother,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
um,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
she know that story, right?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
So he killed himself,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and my mother needs something to do,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
after she,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
uh,

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
robbed me and everyone else in the family

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
of all our money.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Um,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
went to,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
back to,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
uh, art school in New York,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
and,

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
uh,

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Marie was just about to leave her husband,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
and she went to art school in New York at the same time.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
So my mom's like 64,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Marie was like 34 at the same time,

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
but they hit it off,

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
became friends.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
You know,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Marie actually stayed on my mom's house,

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
she knows my sisters,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
she did like cocaine with my mother,

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
which is weird.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
You could imagine,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
with stories,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
it's very weird.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Um,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
anyway,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
so,

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
and not to incriminate me.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
It's a joke,

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
you guys say.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Having coffee with friends.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Right, right.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
So,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
um,

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
and then we hit it off,

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
and she came back to LA,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
and she lived in LA fortunately,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
and,

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
uh,

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
and David needed somebody to,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
um,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
and my mother's side was not talking,

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
and at this point,

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
I was still friends with David,

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
David Unridge,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
and he is someone on my mom's count,

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
and so I said,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
you know what,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
I think I got the perfect person,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
I'm gonna,

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
I'm gonna flip her,

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
and take her from my mom's side,

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
bring her to our side,

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
it's a good side of the force,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
right,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
and I did,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
you know,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
and I did,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
and she became a source of the book,

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
and she told David

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
all the blanks he,

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
uh,

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
was missing,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
and we moved in together,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
you know,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
all my life,

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
I've been like a bachelor,

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
you know,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
kind of spoiled brat,

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
mostly too,

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
and my dad,

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
kind of financed my life,

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
so I,

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I made music,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I had 36 albums in a single,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I had a lot of girlfriends,

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
I fucked around,

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I went on tour,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I had fun,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
you know,

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
and that all,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
went to zero,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
and it all stopped,

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
immediately,

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
and January 26, 2014,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
and I learned,

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
I learned a lot since then,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
a lot of things have changed for me,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and I've never dated a girl

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
with a kid,

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
and I was like,

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
you know what,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
I really love her,

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
and I really like this kid,

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
so why the fuck not?

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
I mean,

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
my father,

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
my mom,

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
when I was a kid,

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
you know,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
and,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
he's a good kid,

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
and it's not that,

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
I mean,

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
it's hard to raise a kid,

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
believe me,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
you know,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
especially when he's a good kid,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
you know,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
he's really happy,

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
but, you know,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
and like,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
most of that's really from me.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
They say it's a much stronger love.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
That you'll ever love,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
yeah,

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
it's true,

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
it's true,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
but I also have like,

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm also not,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
I mean,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I'm like the boyfriend,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
so I mean,

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I'm the father figure,

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
as well,

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
but I guess I don't have the burden

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
that Marie has,

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
and that's,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
like I could see hers,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
she is really upset

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
over little things all the time.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
I'm like,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
why are you getting so upset?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
She'll fuck you.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Anyway,

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
we,

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
we,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
everything was sort of going fine.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I got a bit depressed

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
when Peggy died,

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
a very close friend of mine

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
died January 1st.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
And now,

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Is it?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
No,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
it's 2019,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
you know,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
but,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
that's another story.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
It's a good story,

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
but a long story.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Neil Young,

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
his wife,

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Peggy,

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Neil Young is a real dick,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
a real fucking asshole.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
When I was at the funeral,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
he stood up there on stage,

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
it looked like he had won,

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
like Peggy had died,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
and he got his girl,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
his daughter back,

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
who was,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
he was,

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
this,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
this strange from,

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
and all the money that Peggy took in divorce,

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
and he said,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
there's like,

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
I won,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I got it all back.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
I had to leave early,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
I don't know,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
about what I said.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
The point of that story is

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
because you need to know

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
that Steve,

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
so Steve Tolst,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
okay,

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
he's an Australian,

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
and he is a writer.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
He won like a second prize

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
in a beauty contest,

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
you know,

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
like a runner-up

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
for the Booker Prize,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
but not even

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
when the Booker Prize,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
and he only did it

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
because his father

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
is a very well-placed guy

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
in Sydney,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
and a very wealthy family

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
of lawyers,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
and they did

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
whatever they could.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
So,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
he's sort of like,

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
and I don't say

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
it's just a little bit

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
of the angry boyfriend,

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
he's kind of,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
he's running the capacity,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
he's running sort of like,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
he's not the brightest guy around,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
but he can fool you

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
into believing he is,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
you know,

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
and I think he did that

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
to Marie for a long time,

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
and when she sort of caught on

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
what was really happening,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
she left.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
But,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
when I met her,

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
he was still emailing her

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
20, 30 times a day,

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
texting her,

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
sorry,

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
the equivalent,

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
and she thought she

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
had to respond,

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
and I remember

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
being in a car in like,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
2018,

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm like,

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
why are you responding to this?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Why are you doing this?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Like, every time you have

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
an issue where you have to

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
say, oh, you're going to be fine,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
she's like,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
I don't know,

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
I just feel guilty if I don't.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I'm like,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
well, okay,

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
we don't have to,

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
and then she was

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
like, you're right,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I don't,

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
and then she stopped,

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
and that's when it all started.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
So,

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
he's a kind of guy,

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
I was telling Kim,

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
would rather burn

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
the world down

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
than to

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
allow her to leave him.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Okay,

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
and I never met these

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
attached people before.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
This is new to me,

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
right?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Like,

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
first of all,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm dating a girl with a kid,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
and now there's a boyfriend,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
like,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
the kind you see in

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
freaking television shows,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
you know,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
it exists.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
I didn't know.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
I didn't know.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
I thought she was like,

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
I thought Marie was over exaggerating.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
I'm like,

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
come on,

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
can't it be that offensive?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
She shows me the best.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
I'm like,

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
wow,

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
you know,

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
you have to really be crazy.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
So again,

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
the reason,

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
what you don't know,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
is that when they first met,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
it was sort of normal.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
She was waiting for him to leave,

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
but he stayed

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
and moved into her house.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Then he got sick,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and aneurysm in his back.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
It did something to the spinal nerve,

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
and L4,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I don't know,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I'm not out of position,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
so I don't know exactly,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
but it severed the nerve,

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
pinched the nerve.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
It was something where it paralyzed.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Neck down,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
fully paralyzed.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
She,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Marie is such the type where,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
she actually wrote a letter to

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Sarkozy saying,

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
I need your help,

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
is that Australian,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
and he even paid for his medical bills.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
And Sarkozy fucking responded,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
and said,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
okay.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Yeah,

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
that's Marie.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
So Sarkozy actually paid for his bills?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Sarkozy paid for his bills.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Probably started to write

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Sarkozy for health and planning.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Right?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Yeah,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
what am I doing here

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
when I talk to Sarkozy?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
No.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
But

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
what's really weird

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
is that Steve's father

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
could have paid for it,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
but they didn't,

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
because they were that type of people.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
They can get it for free,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
then they'll take it, right?

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
It doesn't matter that they're taking someone else's

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
scholarship,

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
someone else's

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
fund for their thing,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
they don't care.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
So Marie nursed him back to health

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
after a couple years,

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
and he could walk with him.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Miracle,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
it was a 4% chance of walking,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
you walk.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Oh no,

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
sorry,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
not 4% chance.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
That was,

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
that was having M's 4% chance.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
It was like a very low

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
percent chance of walking,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
but he was up and walking.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
But

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
he would forever have to wear a catheter.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I think it costs me back,

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
I'm not sure how long that lasted,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
but of course,

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
the guy,

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
no hard on,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
cannot get it up,

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
no sex.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
So Marie

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
just was in her,

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
she's very loyal,

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
and she was 22,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
and she met him,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
very young and naive.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
So,

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
what am I doing?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I guess,

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
can't,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
you know,

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
I have to stick with this guy.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
You know,

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
she did last as long as she could,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
and his mind

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and body deteriorated further and further,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
and then she just left.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
She couldn't take it much,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
she left.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Now,

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
between us,

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
they separated in,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
I think 2013,

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
but for the lawyers,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
it's 2018.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Just so you know,

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
because she's,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
you know,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
for the,

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
you know,

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
I don't know any about divorce either,

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
but the lawyer said,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
let's just say 2018.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Okay,

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
so I don't know.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
So,

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
when,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I met him for the first time,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
he seemed,

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
I mean,

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
I was like,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
oh, hello,

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
my name's Val,

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I'm the guy that's fucking your wife.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
He's like,

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
ah, ha, ha,

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
very funny.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
It was a joke,

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
and he laughed,

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
and he took it well.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
He did?

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
He took a chance.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
I did,

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
I did.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Everyone else laughs,

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
you know,

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
but,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
he became more obsessive.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
The text increased

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
tremendously.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
I mean,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
we're talking like 50 to 60,

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
answering me,

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
what are you doing?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't understand.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
And they were like,

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
really negative.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
It's all designed to make her hurt,

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
feel like shit,

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
feel guilty,

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
you know,

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
or feel sorry for him.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Every single one is designed for that.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
I printed them all out,

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
gave them to the lawyer.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
It's,

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
just to read them,

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
it's like weird.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
You guys,

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
it's a fun read,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
if you ever want to,

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
if you're bored.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
I'll send it to you if you want.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
But it's disturbing,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
too,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
because it's a sign of obsession,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
and that's never going to end well,

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
you know.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
So,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
fast forward to a bunch of stuff,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
on April 10th,

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
or,

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
sorry,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
before April 10th,

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
COVID hit,

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
and Marla had to be

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
taught home,

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
homeschooled now,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
so he had the logins

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
to the computer,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
you know,

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
such a nightmare at first.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
It was such a nightmare.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Oh, man, yeah.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Trying to get him to do homework,

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
and he's lying,

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
now he's lying all the time.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
And this kid,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
he never lied.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
He like,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
was so honest and happy,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
he couldn't put him anywhere,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and he would start talking to everybody,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
and everyone would be

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
in trance by his conversation.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
He is a smart kid,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
he's so smart.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
But now,

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
he's lying.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
I mean,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
why is he lying?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Is he trying to hide something?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
He's depressed,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
he's something's wrong,

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
he doesn't either,

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
but Marie always blames Steve,

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
no matter what,

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
it's always Steve.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
And I kind of learned

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
that she's,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
you know,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
almost always right too,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
you know,

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
because he comes,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
it's a 50-50 custody at this point.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Sorry,

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
for a year,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
it was 50-50 custody.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Before that,

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
it was 80-20,

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Marie, okay?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
But for the last year,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
they tried 50-50.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Steve says,

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
and I have a lot of records,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
saying I cannot take care

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
of Marla for more than a week

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
at a time.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
All he does

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
is he sits in the little office,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
and he writes the books.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
He works for screenwriting

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
for some comedy TV show,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
it's not very funny.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Two police officers

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
are detectives in a car

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
the whole time.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Security?

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Something security?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I don't know.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
It's not that good.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
It's not that good.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
So that's why he's in the country.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Not Tim and Jamie.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
I needed,

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Marie wanted to divorce him,

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
she's been wanting him

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
for so long,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
but she can't,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
because,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
but because of the visa

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
that she was on,

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
she was tied to it,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
she could not work in America,

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
and she was trying to do,

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
you know,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
she would still

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
do some cash jobs,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
or she'd teach French,

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
or art,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
to the mothers,

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
to go to a school called Lila,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
it's a French,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
for French people.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
And there's something

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
we were going on about that

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
school too,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
you guys should be aware of.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Very,

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
something's off.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
But,

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
what was I saying?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Sorry,

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
you know that Lila,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
French school,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
and it brought up,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
80, 20, 50, 50.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, the custody,

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
that's right.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Yeah.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
And then COVID.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
That's right.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah, she's,

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
well, now Marie works in rehab.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
She works at arts,

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
which is another crazy thing

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
about DCFS.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
She works in rehab,

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
which is randomly drug tested

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
every week, right?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
So,

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
but I'll get to that.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
She teaches art therapy

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
to all these drug addicts.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
She's able to work,

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
and Marla's able to work,

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
and everything's going fine,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
and then Steve,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
one day, comes over,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
because we're a day late,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
or there was some misinterpretation,

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
and this,

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
something happened,

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
someone didn't communicate

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
with someone about Marla,

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
one who was supposed to be picked up.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Steve knows to never come

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
by place, or loft.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
He knows to never come by,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and we don't go to his place either.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
It's an unspoken rule.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
He comes over,

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
and he,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
he's wearing a mask

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
that was white,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
but he drew,

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
and this was really weird,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I thought, he drew teeth.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
He's a 50 year old man,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
okay, and he drew teeth

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
on the mask.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
He came over,

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
and I had a security camera,

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
so I had the whole thing on tape.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
It was wonderful,

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
this is fucking hilarious.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
But,

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
he goes,

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
he comes over,

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
and you know,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
you see pedestrians throw by,

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
and they're just normal people,

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
when you can see someone going for a run,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
and someone just walking the dog,

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
but then you see a slow,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
perambling,

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
what the hell is this?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
And it's, of course, Steve.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I mean, I don't know if he's high,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
But he makes it to the front door,

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
he knocks,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
he blows up his one sleeve,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
he's preparing for something, obviously.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
And,

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
no, I don't,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I don't really see this in retrospect.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
At the time,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I'm upstairs having a joke

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and laughing with Marla and Marie.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Like, we're like on the floor laughing

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
about word Al Jankiewicz,

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
because Yoda,

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
you know what I'm saying, Yoda?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Why Yoda?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Yoda is great.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
But Marla just learned it,

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
so he was laughing.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
And then the door is,

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
someone's knocking the door,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
and it's around five o'clock, I remember,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
because that's when Steve's always on time,

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
perfectly.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
And I'm like,

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
what the fuck?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
So I said,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
I'll go check,

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
and I open the door,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
and I see Steve,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
and Steve goes,

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Marla,

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Marla,

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
he starts screaming for Marla.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Marie is so freaked out,

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
she takes Marla,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
and she hides in the bathroom.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's the only door in the loft as a lock,

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
and it's like,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
just the furthest,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
it's the furthest from the front door,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
actually, too.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
And I was like,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
wow,

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
like she really,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
she was fucking scared.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
And I don't want her scared,

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
it's just like a little,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
you know,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
puny guy can barely walk,

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
so I,

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
but he starts,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
he says,

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
I want him to,

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
I'm here to pick up Marla,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
and I say,

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
no, you're not,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
you cannot be here,

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
you're not supposed to be here.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
What are you doing here?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
You gotta go.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
No, I'm picking up Marla,

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
it's five o'clock,

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
look, just,

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
let me put on some shoes,

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
and some socks,

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
and a jacket,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
and I was,

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
I wasn't fully dressed,

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I was like,

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
sweatpants,

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
and shirt.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Let me come outside,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
and I'll,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
and I'll talk to you about it.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
He said,

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
well,

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
there's not much to talk about,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
but okay,

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
so he goes back,

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
I close the door,

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
and now,

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
what I learned later,

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
is when I closed the door,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
he whipped out his cell phone,

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
and he opened up an app,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
and he starts flipping through porn.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Normal, right?

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
No, not,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
very odd behavior.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
I was like,

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
what the fuck,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
but it wasn't like porn porn,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
it was like dating site porn,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
with the couples.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
It was fucking weird,

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
right?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
To come over to the house,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
not gonna be angry at me,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
because he was kind of like,

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
his voice was raised,

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
I'm telling you,

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
like a really brief version,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
but then just like,

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
not chill out,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
like,

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
it was very strange.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
I tell him,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
look, it's okay,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm gonna handle it,

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
and Marla says,

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
you know what,

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
my dad,

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
he just needs to be reassured,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
and Marla's like,

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
no, no, no,

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
no reassuring,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
just stay here with me in the bathtub,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
and like,

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
you guys are just gonna be fine,

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
I'm just gonna talk to him,

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
and you'll leave.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
So I get dressed,

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
I open the door,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
and the door opens up this way,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
and then as my door,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
as the door's open,

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
he comes in,

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
shoulder,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
right here,

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
to break my,

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
my,

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
my grip,

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
on the door,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
but I,

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
he's not that strong,

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
so I,

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
he doesn't break my grip,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
he just makes me upset,

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
so I grab,

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
and I pull him out,

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
and he doesn't quite hit the car,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
his first reaction is,

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
oh, my back,

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
right,

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
like a,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
sort of like a,

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
childish thing,

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
very strange,

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
for a 50-year-old man,

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
and I said,

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
oh, shut the fuck up,

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
and now you can hear me,

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
the profanity's out,

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
I'm like,

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
are you stupid,

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
are you that stupid,

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
I mean,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
to fight a,

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
you know,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
and I said,

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
this is California,

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
this is,

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
you know,

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
good thing I'm not like California,

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
because,

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
you know,

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
they carry guns,

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
like,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
people can have guns,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
I don't even have a gun,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
you know,

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
things like this,

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
and then he,

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
he,

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
I said,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
look,

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
this is on camera,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
then he's like,

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
you just lost,

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
you just lost the divorce,

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
you just lost everything,

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
you fucked up man,

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
you gotta go now,

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
he's like,

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
I'm not leaving,

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
so,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
short version is,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
I throw him out to the sidewalk,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I push him until he's in the,

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
it's still private property,

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
but I just sort of say,

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
now you're in the streets,

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
you can leave us alone though,

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
and I tell you,

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
I will,

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
and I made him a promise,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
I will bring Marlo out,

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
you can say hello to Marlo,

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
I will bring him out,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
and you have my word on that,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
but you have to be by your car,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
you cannot be on our property,

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
and you can agree to do it,

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
go to his car,

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
so Marlo,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
please do me a favor,

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
can you come out with me,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
but just don't let go of my hand,

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
and Marlo says,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
okay,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
and he does not let go of my hand

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
all the time,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
because I know he's gonna try and steal him,

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
and he tried twice,

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
the whole time,

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
I recorded everything on my phone,

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
it's all,

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
it's all there,

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
and the video camera,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
so when that incident occurred,

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Marie and I sat down and talked,

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
and she said,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
the deterioration has gone severe,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
this is a line that's crossed,

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
and Marie's in the middle of the forest,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and to cross this line,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
in the middle of the forest,

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
is very stupid,

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
okay,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
so that means the brain has deteriorated

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
further than we even imagined,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
so Marie is very concerned,

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
and she's like,

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
I'm not giving Marlo back down,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
so she holds on to Marlo

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
for the last five months,

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
so we had Marlo,

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
and we were like,

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
it's fun to have like,

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
now we're like a family,

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
for five months,

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
we found Marlo,

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
you know,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
we all got to know each other,

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
and Marlo,

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
you know,

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
it's really funny,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
it was nice.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
How long have you been living with Marlo?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Two and a half years now,

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
but you know,

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
you see Marlo every other week.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Like five months?

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Yeah, yeah,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
it was a lot at first,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
especially for me,

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
but I got used to it,

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
it wasn't,

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
it wasn't so,

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
you know,

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
I thought it was going to be even worse for me,

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
but you know,

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
expect the worst.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
It's a good day,

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
it could go any way.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Yeah, it's true, it's true,

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
but you know,

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
and we'd see Steven,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
and the fear,

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
see the fear and the lying,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
and we'd try to teach him to not lie,

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
like he starts lying,

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
like he talks,

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
I said,

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Marlo,

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
why are these lies?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
And we know where they come from,

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
because Steve,

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
this is how Steve talks,

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
he lies constantly,

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
he's always,

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
he's always,

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
and we felt like we made some progress,

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
you know,

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
he was,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
he had more self-confidence,

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
like he was afraid of dancing,

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
and eight year old,

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
afraid of dancing,

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
because he's self-conscious,

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
he's fucking silly,

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
so we started dancing more

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
to make him less self-conscious,

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
and we did these kung fu outfits,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
so we pretended we were kung fu fighting,

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
you know,

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
saw him kung fu fighting,

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
he loves it,

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
so his confidence is back,

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
he's happy,

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
and he fucking said to me,

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
three days before this,

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
all went to shit,

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
he said,

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
well,

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I wish you were my father,

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
he said to me,

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
and it broke my heart,

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
it broke my heart,

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
I mean,

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
I felt great and warm,

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
but it also broke my heart,

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
you know,

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
and I know that feeling,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
because I grew up in foster care,

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
you know,

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
I know that feeling,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I've been to two different,

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
different families,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
and different mothers,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
and different fathers,

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
I had two brothers once in foster care,

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
you know,

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
you know, home.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
You remember it pretty well?

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah, yeah,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and one I don't,

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
two I remember pretty well,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
the last one I remember very well,

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
because there was,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
there wasn't the horrible system

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
that you hear about,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
this is a nice happy Jewish family,

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
a loving family,

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
they're like good people,

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
you know,

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
even in Chicago,

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
in Cook County,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
Carol and Larry Payless,

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
I remember,

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
it's not like the shoe store,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
it's Payless,

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
I said,

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
oh,

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
sometimes for a different climate,

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
it's a lot like a craft shoe,

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I see.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Yeah,

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
I got lucky,

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
I got lucky,

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
because I heard the stories,

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
you know,

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
so,

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
it's still,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
it's still in the middle, yeah.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
No, nothing,

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
there's fighting,

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
and Steve is using this now,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
as a tool in the divorce,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
everything that just happened is,

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
weaponizing DCFS,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
he just did it,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
and it forgot it limited capacity,

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
I know that it wasn't him,

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
it's gotta be the lawyers,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
his lawyers are pretty smart,

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
because he's got money,

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
he's got like seven lawyers,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
you know,

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
you have one guy

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
that barely leaves his office,

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
we do most of the work,

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Marie and I.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Anyway,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
so Marie and I are like,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
we've gone through two cleaning ladies,

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
one live in the brewery,

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
and one girl,

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
she's great,

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
she was like too cute for me,

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
because,

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
why is she doing it?

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Marie,

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
why is she doing it?

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
I'm not staring at her,

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
why does she have to worry

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
about these tight pants?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
I'm like,

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
no, I didn't ask her,

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
it's not my fault,

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
and then one day,

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
she's like,

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
you know what,

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
I don't want to clean,

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
I want to sing,

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
I want to make music,

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
I'm like, okay,

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
go make some music,

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
so she quit,

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
so we start cleaning,

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
and in Richard,

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
you know,

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Marla gets in trouble,

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
we're like,

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
oh,

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
you gotta do the dishes,

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
you know,

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
you have to wipe and clean,

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
and he doesn't like that either,

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
so we thought,

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
why not do,

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
get a nanny slash,

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
a housekeeper,

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
okay,

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
somebody can do both,

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
watch Marla,

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
we can have some time alone,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and they can clean the fucking house.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
So we do put the feelers out,

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Marie puts them out

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
on some next door,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
it's a couple other websites.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
I ask everybody,

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
I know,

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
oh,

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
sorry,

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
I forgot,

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
I almost forgot Patel.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
Patel is a labor,

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
one,

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
two,

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
three,

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
three doors down,

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
four doors down,

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
I thought she'd just moved in,

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
in like July,

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
or sorry,

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
mid June,

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
I'd never seen her before,

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
but all of a sudden,

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
she's there,

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
everywhere,

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
very loud and boisterous,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
and she,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
outside,

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
look,

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
at our place,

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
there's a little park

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
across the way,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
and Marla always hangs out there,

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
and so everyone,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
sort of,

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
the brewery,

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
the brewery,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
artist loft,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
it's like an artist community,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
so it's a campus,

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
more or less,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and it's just 300 lofts,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
with a whole bunch of it,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
with six or 900 people in it,

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
it's a different spot,

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
so everyone hangs out

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
in the sort of park areas,

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
where we are,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
because it's closest to us.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
She says,

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
she saw him in the park,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
and she showed him his jewelry,

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
and he said,

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
oh, I want to make this,

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
just some jewelry,

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
and I was like,

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
you want to make crystal jewelry?

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
He's like,

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
yes,

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
I want to make crystal jewelry.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Like, okay, Marla,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
you can make some crystal jewelry.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
So we take him over there,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
and she seems sane, right?

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I know something's off,

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
you know,

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
I mean,

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
I can sense it,

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
I know something's wrong,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
but I figure maybe this is like,

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
she's in a,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
just got her parents' house,

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
or she's moving,

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
trying to make her life,

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
or start a new world.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
I mean,

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
there's no way she's making money

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
selling crystal jewelry, okay?

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
It's,

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
first of all,

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
it's shitty jewelry,

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
no one's buying it,

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
and it's way too expensive.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
It's not $4,500 a month,

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
on that place.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
I know what she's paying too.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
So,

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
I figure there's some parents

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
paying for it,

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
or something,

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
or maybe a brother,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
definitely not a sugar daddy type,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
because she's the most unattractive

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
woman I've ever seen.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Like,

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
you see her,

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
and you're like,

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
whoa,

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
okay,

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
and it's unfortunate for her,

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
but it is true.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
So,

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
anyway,

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
she,

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
we brought her over,

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
and we approved

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
for like two hours a day.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
We thought that couldn't be,

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
literally,

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
you can walk in 10 seconds

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
and get to her house,

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
or something.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
It's like,

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
there's no danger,

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
you know?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
And Miles said,

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
please, please,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
can I have that crystal jewelry, please?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Okay,

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
yes,

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
and we get two hours to ourselves now.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
So,

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
we're happy.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
So,

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
for five days,

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
and he makes crystal jewelry.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
He comes back for lunch.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
He eats with us.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Sometimes,

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Marie brings them lunch.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Sometimes,

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
I'll go over there

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
and just see what's going on.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Everything's friendly and copicetic.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
You can always,

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
she's no problem.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
She's a talker.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
She likes to jab her

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
about herself.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
She will not ask you anything

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
about how you are,

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
where you're from,

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
or anything.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
She'll just tell you everything

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
she knows about everybody.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Gossip,

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
gossip, gossip.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
People live like that.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Yeah,

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
yeah.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
It's,

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
well,

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
it's because that's what she thinks

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
her value is,

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
and that's why we're,

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
you know,

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
it's very,

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
I understand it,

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
but,

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
but I mentioned,

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Marlo,

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
like,

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
making crafts.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Anything,

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
and we found someone,

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
like,

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
I'll talk to him, too.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
And that was like,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
you know,

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
it was so,

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
it was interesting,

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
but he loved it.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
And he even said,

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
down,

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
down Marlo,

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
bye,

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
have you liked my whole life?

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
I've already made crystal jewelry.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Your whole life,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
figures on.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
He's like,

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
it's a huge revelation,

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
yeah.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
All right, Marlo,

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
you go for it.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Of course,

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
he got bored with it,

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
you know,

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
four days later.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
But on Saturday,

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Patil decided to sell the jewelry

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
that she had been making with Marlo.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
So,

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
they go and they set up

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
a thing in the park,

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
like,

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
just a table,

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
and all the people from

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
the community come over

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
and they see Marlo,

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
and he's fucking adorable,

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
selling jewelry,

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
so people buy jewelry.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Of course,

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
I buy most of it,

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
you know,

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
so,

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
and I have to buy some Patil's jewelry, too,

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
because it looks bad,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
but she's not really selling any.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
So,

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
I buy some of her,

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
so I spend like 250 bucks

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
on this useless jewelry

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
that's already broken,

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
right?

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Um,

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Steve is $250.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
I don't know.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
No,

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
no,

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
I've not,

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
but it's like 30 pieces,

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
you know,

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
it's ridiculous.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Yeah,

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
you don't need it,

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
trust me.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
It's not necessary.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
But,

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
but Steve,

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
I invite Steve,

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
because I'm a nice guy.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
So,

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
I'm like,

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Steve would like to see this.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
His son is making money

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
on something he created

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
on his own.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
He's better than with his first $20.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
So,

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
he's ever earned.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Steve would like to see this.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
I think it would be a good idea.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
And Marie's like,

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
no.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I say,

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
come on,

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
let him,

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
he's got to,

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
he'll enjoy this.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Because we give him visits every week

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
or whenever he wants to,

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
well,

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
not whenever,

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
basically once a week,

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
but whenever he wants to talk tomorrow,

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
we let him talk,

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
unless tomorrow does not want to talk

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
and not as often.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
And he does not want to accept that.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Um,

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
so,

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
I invite him over

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
and he comes over

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
and,

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
um,

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
and,

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
oh, shit.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Um,

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
I forgot I'm working today too,

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
but it's okay.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
I put on an option

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
because I don't have to worry about it

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
till next week.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Um,

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
so,

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
he comes over

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
and he's

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
instantly in the mood changes.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
You'll,

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
if you ever meet him,

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
you'll see for yourself.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
You know,

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
it's one of those people,

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
everything's sort of down,

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
now I'm depressing

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
and self-conscious.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
You know,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
because that's what he,

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
that's what he emulates.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Um,

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
he seems somewhat immune

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
to it right now,

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
but he won't be in the future.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
I know it.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
I could see it happen.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Um,

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
he asked Patille

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
for her number.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Steve.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
Steve does.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Which I thought was strange.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Um,

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
but not too strange.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Marie said

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
he never asked people

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
for her number.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
This is not a good idea.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Okay.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
And I said,

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
well,

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
I'll trust you.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Um,

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
later that night,

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Patille,

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
uh,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Marie and I are,

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
uh, walking.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
For some reason,

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
we didn't walk to the,

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
now we weren't doing the laundry,

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
we had to walk past the park.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
I can't remember why.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Um,

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
and we see Patille

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
and three other girls

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
sitting in the park

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
by candlelight talking.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
And I go,

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
hey,

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
nice to see you guys.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
We're going back,

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
going to bed,

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
cause I had to wake up early

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
for some reason.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Um,

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
I can't remember why.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
I had to wake up early.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
I was upset at Marie

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
for making me stay up so late.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
You know,

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
I was like,

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
I had to,

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
he promised me

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
to get to bed before,

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
and I had to do extra shit

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
for something.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
So she says,

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
okay,

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
don't worry,

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
let's just have a quick talk

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
with Patille

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
and talk about the day.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
So,

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
you know,

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
okay,

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
fine.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
But that quick talk with Patille

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
means she's going to talk

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
to you at you for an hour.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
You know,

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
and of course,

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
I'm,

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
and Marielett does it,

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
so I'm the one that says,

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
okay,

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
enough,

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
I've got to go to sleep.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Right?

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
I'm going to have to be the asshole.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
So I say,

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
okay, fine.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
She comes into our place

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
for the first time.

54:04.000 --> 54:11.000
In our entrance living room, we have a loft, there's an upstairs, back room, there's a whole bunch of fucking space.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
And I'm like, okay, great, let's just go outside and smoke a cigarette and have a go.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
She says, okay.

54:17.000 --> 54:23.000
Go outside and we're underneath now my surveillance camera, okay?

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
And I have a 30-day fucking break point.

54:27.000 --> 54:36.000
Marie is typing a letter now to send to LogiCircle to get this fucking tape because this will change everything.

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
Patille and we're smoking a cigarette and Patille goes on a tirade about how much she sees evil in Steve.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
I looked in his eyes and all I saw was pure evil.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
You know, like they're really dramatic.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
She's like really, she gets in my face like, I don't really, I got in his eyes and I saw nothing.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
It was blank. It was evil.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
I said, no, Patille, what you saw was emptiness. There's just nothing in there.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
He's not very smart.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
She was, no, no, no, it was evil.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
This was our conversation for like a good 15 minutes, right?

55:09.000 --> 55:17.000
So not only are we confident that Patille hates Steve, you know, that she's not going to sell us out or do anything stupid.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
We were like, okay, she's, you know, we believe her.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
But, you know, I don't realize and I'm stupid because I forgot this is classic bipolar.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
That's what I picked up on.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
This woman is fucking classic bipolar.

55:29.000 --> 55:36.000
And I've seen this so many times and I was dumb to not listen to my instinct that first day when I knew something was wrong.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
I didn't know what it was.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
I didn't think about it hard enough.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
I think that's where I fucked up because that's what she is.

55:42.000 --> 55:48.000
And now I see it because they flip one extreme to the next and that's exactly what happened.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
Now in her report, she says she reached out to Steve via Instagram.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Not true.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
They have, she's got a phone number.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Okay.

55:56.000 --> 56:05.000
She wrote a report because we stopped seeing her after this because also there was something she was fucking dancing naked with M, supposedly.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
M says she was dancing, but she may or may or not have been naked.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
So M doesn't really understand.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
He's going either way.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
Right.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
So I don't know what that means with M, but I don't like it.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
He said he felt uncomfortable.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
He tried not to look.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
All he said, all I wanted to do was finish making the jewelry and she wanted to dance.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
So that was enough for us to think this is enough of this.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Okay.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
We put him in camp the next day.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
He goes to a beach day camp for the next two weeks.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Now we don't hear from Patel for a long time.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
We think something's wrong.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Why is she like say hello?

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
We don't see because she's not voice person friendly.

56:40.000 --> 56:45.000
Then we get hit with Steve's lawyers.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
Like a dossier.

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
They send like a thing saying here are the witness statements I have.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Why yours is a terrible person.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Here's why I'm great.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Not quite enough to do.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
It's like an aggregate.

57:01.000 --> 57:08.000
Yeah, summary of what she wanted and other people saying that me is a terrible person.

57:08.000 --> 57:20.000
I want to say July 30th approximately July 30th.

57:20.000 --> 57:27.000
So we see this and what we read is so fucking outrageously crazy.

57:27.000 --> 57:37.000
She said that M is walking around without a shirt barefoot and is combing through garbage for fucking food.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Seriously.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
He's going through dumpster for food.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And he says Marie is doing the same thing.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Or sorry, she says Marie is doing the same thing.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
And then she says that Marie is walking around itching and scratching with sores all over her body.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
A classic junkie.

57:50.000 --> 57:55.000
She named every single drug in the world from fucking crystal meth that PCP did.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Some exotic crazy shit.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
You remember in the heart of, you know.

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
She says that there is a secret hidden room in her loft where all the drugs are stored in the paraphernalia.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Okay.

58:07.000 --> 58:16.000
She says I have 40, I'm not exaggerating, 40 to 50 cell phones scattered on the tables.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Okay.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Not fucking exaggerating.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
And it's even worse.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
They're worse crazy shit.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
But those are the ones I remember right now.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
And we're like what the fuck.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
You know, and immediately I think that Steve paid her.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
He had to pay her.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
But this is before I figured out the bipolar thing.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
What is the lawyer asking for?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
They want nothing.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
The lawyer said nothing.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
This is like a tactic.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
At this point you guys are full custody.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
Well, see the custody arrangement as far as I understand it.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Again, I'm not a lawyer and I've never been through it.

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
But since they're still married they both have equal rights to Marla.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
But no one has any, there are no rules set.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
So it was a verbal agreement to say 50-50 for a year.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
So when Marie said no 50-50 it was perfectly legal for her to do that.

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
And then she felt bad and she thought well maybe I should give him to,

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
and also we could want it some time alone after a couple months or like,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
maybe we should give him to Steve for like a month,

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
or sorry, for a week.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And then our lawyer said no.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Because there was no rule to stop him from keeping Marla.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
You know, just as you did he can do the same.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
So we're like okay, so we keep him.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
So when we see this thing from Utila it just freaks us out.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
Like what the fuck.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
And then DCFS comes over.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And I never heard of DCFS.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
I don't know what the acronym stood for.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
I'm sure I was visited by them as a child.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Because it seems like I remember something.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
I did have a social worker I remember.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
But the first woman that came over was named Priscilla.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
And she was very nice.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
She came over and she, I let her in which is stupid.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And I realized now you should never let them in if they ever come to your house.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It's a thing you can take.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
They can never take away a child if you don't let them in.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That's what I was told by Laura.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
But she came in.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
She viewed the house.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
It was safe.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It was loving.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It was fun.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It was a good fucking home.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And she reported that.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Okay.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Now Marie said to her in her interview that there was an incident that she was worried about.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And I remember very well.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
We came home from shopping one day.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And Marlo just starts telling us like a confession.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
This crazy story about touching penises at the Mark and Bobax house.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
These people that sort of turned on Marie.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
They were friends of Marie.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And then some reason they were not.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
They just turned and then chose Steve's side.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Because people would need divorce.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
People would pick sides.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It's shitty.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
People are fucking shitty.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You call someone a friend.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I mean, it really hurt her.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It really hurt her.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And the things they said were so fucking ridiculous and stupid.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Anyway, it's the...

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
What was the point of that?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Sorry.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I need some more coffee.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I'm talking too much about coffee.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Okay.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So what was it just before that?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Oh, DCLA.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
So what comes to the house?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
She says, are you willing to take drugs to us?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And we say, yes, you're willing to take drugs to us.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Great.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We don't hear back from her for about three or four days.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Actually, we've never heard back from her.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
That was the last we saw at Priscilla.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Next thing we know, police are at the door.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
This is actually the second time police came.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
They came before Priscilla came.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And then they came.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Then Priscilla and then the police came again.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And then...

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
No, this is Sabah Abta.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And Erasmo...

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Aguilera.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Aguilera.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Not Aguilera, but Aguilera without the A.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Those are not the police?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Those are not the police.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
These are more DCFS.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
DCFS?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Yeah.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And now it's 10.30 at night and they're coming knocking door at 10.30 at night.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And so, Marie's not home.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
She's at Amy's.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And she's all under your camera.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
She'll put it on YouTube or something like that.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And they are...

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
You know, first they wake up Marlon.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
They're banging on the door.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And Marlon was asleep.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I was asleep.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Because I woke up fucking early to the trade options.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You know, like 6 o'clock, 6.30.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
The market's open at 6.30.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I have to be awake and ready at 6.30 a.m.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
So, you know, I'm half asleep.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
And Marlon's like,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Someone's at the door.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Someone's at the door.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I'm like, Marlon, why aren't you asleep?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You're supposed to be asleep.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
They woke me up.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
They woke me up.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It's okay.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So I go out and I open the door.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And I see...

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And I say, where's DCFS?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
We're going to talk to you.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I'm like, I just spoke to you guys.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
You were just here, you know?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And he's like, well, you got another call.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And I'm like, fucking...

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And I know it's Patel calling every day.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Patel and Steve's together calling every day.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Just to fuck with us.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
You see where they can get.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I know it.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
You know?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And they know it too.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
So I'm like, you know, I'm just sort of sick of it.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I don't really want to do this anymore.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But I talk to them.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
We have a conversation.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm very friendly.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You know, I'm not...

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I don't give them any shit.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
And they just...

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I don't remember legally if they...

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
If I invited them or they just walked in the house.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
So they ended up getting in the house.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I don't remember saying, yeah, go ahead, please.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Come in for another round.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But they did.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And they did the rounds.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And we joked and we laughed.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Now, here's...

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
No.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
This is where I...

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
We broke down.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Marie and I have been doing this for three days.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Like, nonstop.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Working on this thing that you guys sent.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You know, breaking every single word by word,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
every line by line.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Where the lies are and what we can prove.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
We have documentary evidence for it when we don't.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Right?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
For example, she says, I knocked on the door

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
and took about ten minutes to come to the door.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It took two minutes and thirty-two seconds.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Okay?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Two minutes and thirty-two fucking seconds.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
She says, we went through the house.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
There was no food in the refrigerator.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It was scarce.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
We had just ordered about three hundred and fifty-four hundred dollars

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
from Amazon delivery.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Fresh, direct.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
To come fucking two guys full of...

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
car full of food.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It was overflowing.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We made jokes.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I joked them.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I said, look, ha!

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Guess you can't say where you're going.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
So we're starving him.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And we all laughed about it.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
In the report, it says, scarce.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Those are just, like, too little things.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
No, I'm not even getting into the big ones.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
It was delivered the next day.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
No, it was there.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It was already there.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
The night before, we had got ordered it.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And we had packed up the fridge and the pantries.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
All right?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
It was like, what the fuck?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
We couldn't believe what we were reading.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And if you read that thing, the first fourteen, fifteen pages are like,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
okay, fine.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So it's normal.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Nothing's wrong here.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And then we become, like, the worst people you've ever heard.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
It's like fucking crazy shit.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And somehow, I don't give her the number.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
She has Tim's number.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
How the fuck does she get Tim's number?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And she says, and there's a little note at the end,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
because she's trying to discredit me as much as she can.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And you can see that it's really hard.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Worse than David Enridge did at The New York Times.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Like, really come after me.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But I don't understand.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I'm what I did to anger her.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I have a recording, because I've learned to record pretty much everything.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
You know, it's smart, because no way people can fuck with you.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And another question, why?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Like, I am.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I'm joking.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I'm just going to steal it from your cloud later.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But what was I saying?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I recorded her saying, well, obviously, you know, the house is great.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Obviously, Marlo loves you and you love Marlo.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It's not, you know, you guys are great.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Just, we want you to take a drug test, and that's it.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And I'm like, okay, that's it.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I agreed.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And then I said, and then there's another phone call later,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
because the next day, four police officers came.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And that's where I was just, I had enough.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I'm like, look, more fucking police officers.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Ed, this is the fourth day in a row, and you're still doing this.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
At what point is this harassment?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
This is like a few weeks ago.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Oh, this is much, what's today the 12th?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So today, yeah, we're in August now.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
We're in August.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I was looking at the footage last night again.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
It was July 29th.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
This must be the 30th now.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
30th or August 1st, right around there.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Yeah, I think so.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Because the police came the next day, so it must be the 30th.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
How many days are in July?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
July 31.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So it's 30th or 31st.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I didn't even know.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I didn't even know.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I had zero ideas when I asked.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
So, yeah.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So all of this stuff that's happening,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
is that what was court on, what was it, on Monday?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
No, no, no.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
It gets worse.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It gets worse when you get to what happens on Sunday.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So I'm like, I say, Savva, look,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
and I read her this email.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I said, look, nothing personal against you.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You seem like a good person.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I just, I'm tired of everyone of you guys believing this woman

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and accepting this as fact and not even investigating the caller.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Clearly, this woman is out of her mind.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And how can you not delineate saying from insane,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I think that's your job, but I didn't say it like that.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I said it very kindly.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I have a copy of it.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I supported you.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And I said, look, I'm just going to say we'll do the drug test,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
but that's it.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
We're going to put our foot down.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
We're not going to do anything else after the drug test.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
All right.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
We're just going to, we're not going to, we're going to stop.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So you tell us what the next move is and we will oblige.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And that I can quote.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I mean, I said that tell us what the next move is

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and we will oblige.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
That's a quote, right?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And then I didn't hear from her.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And then Tuesday of that week, we interviewed a clean lady.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
She came to us from, see, I still think Patel sent her this woman

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
because I asked Patel, do you know anyone that it will clean and babysit?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Because I feel bad that you, I don't want you to think

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
we're sending Marla over to your place to babysit.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Okay.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So I was trying to overcompensate by saying,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
please give me the name and number of a fucking babysitter.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
You know, so that way she wouldn't think that.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
You know, so I still suspect it came from her,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
but Marie thinks it came from somebody else.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So I don't know.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But she called us and said, I heard you're looking for a babysitter.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And I said, yes, we are, but also a cleaning lady too.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Like you need to be able to clean.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So she says, I can do that.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And so we meet her on Tuesday.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I honestly have no memory of this meeting.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
But Marie says we met on Tuesday.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I don't know.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I don't remember it.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I mean, briefly, I remember saying, okay, thank you, shaking a hand.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But I don't know, maybe because I didn't sleep much the night before.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Cause I mean, it's really weird when you don't sleep, you know,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
and then, you know, cause I'll take a nap at like 130 when the market closes.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And then my mind will refresh itself.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
But sometimes I don't get that nap.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So, but Marie showed me and she said, look, right here,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
you can see the text between Lori and us.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
She was here on Tuesday.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So she went back home and she came back on Friday.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And that was her first day.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
She worked Friday and she was good.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And we paid her 80 bucks in the center on Saturday.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
She comes back, but she comes late.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Okay.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
She is like very late.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And she says, I went to the dentist and had an abscess.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And she showed pictures to prove it that she was at the dentist.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I said, okay, fine.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
So she does all the cleanser of the kitchen,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
does all the dishes and does the sheets, half the sheets of laundry.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It takes Marla with her.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
One interesting thing happened.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Marla was freaked out in the laundry room.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And he said to his mom and friends that she,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Lori turned white and really white.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And he thought she was going to die.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
This is Marla.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So he was very scared for her.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And we sat her down.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
We asked her, are you okay?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
She said, I'm fine.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I'm fine.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
It's a COPD she has.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It's called, it's some sort of pulmonary thing.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I don't really know.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Apparently.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Yes.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Apparently she has machines at home.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
She has a machine, like a little machine that helps her breathe.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Which I'm like, okay.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And she had a bunch of these things.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
The inhaler.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And it's strange.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Everyone has an inhaler.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
She knows, but there's a different looking one.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It's very odd.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And it has the date and a wheel.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So I don't know that much about that one.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
She doesn't want to go home.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Okay.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
She's like 60 years old, mid 60s actually.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Found out how old she was.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
She was born in 1960.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So she's exactly 60 years.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And then the reason I did that math really quick is because I already knew the answer.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Okay.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I knew the answer.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So she starts crying.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
At first it was a laugh.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I heard them both laughing upstairs and I said, what's so funny?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
What's the joke?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I want to know the joke.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
And I go, oh, you won't get it.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
You're a man.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I'm like, oh, okay, fine.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And then I go to the bathroom and then I come out and the crying turned to sobbing.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Severe fucking sobbing.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
She was hugging Marie and Marie looked at me like, you know, she also gave me like the

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
go away.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's a girl thing.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
You're not going to let me handle it.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
It's okay.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
So I go downstairs and Marie says, look, let's let her stay.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
She doesn't want to go home.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
So we'll put her up in the, we have in the little room at the top of the, if you see the layout,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
come over.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
You guys will see the layout for yourselves.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
So she stays in the little room upstairs.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't think much too much about it.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
It's not a big deal.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
She wakes up, she takes a bath, which is odd.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You know, you don't do that.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
It's a weird behavior.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
She takes a bath and she starts cleaning again.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And we're like, okay, fine.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Clean again.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Sunday was the last, a third day anyway.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
We did a three day trial and it was the final day.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So we knew she was gone for good no matter what on Sunday.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
She's always going out to her car.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Okay.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Which I did not think was too suspicious.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I just thought she was going to join or something because she came back a little, you know,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
different, but happy, always happy, not miserable.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And she would talk about her life a little bit.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000
She told us about her daughter in Italy and she married a very wealthy Italian guy.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And then it gets to be around 9.30, 10.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And I'm like, Marie, you handled the hours.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I don't, we're not going to pay her for the time she slept.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Right.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
We're not paying her.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
So you take care of this.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I don't want to deal with it.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I'm going to the number and I'll send her the money.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Marie goes, says, okay.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Next thing I'm in my office area.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Marie is not hit with her.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
She comes in and says, I'm really tired.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Do you mind if I lay down for a few minutes before I drive home?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And I say, sure, fine, no problem.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
So she's wearing like a jacket getting ready to, she's ready to leave.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And then I look at her and like, she's actually ready to leave.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
It's good.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Take a nap.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Go for it.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
She lies down.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
She doesn't wake up.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
She dies.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
She fucking died on her bed.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
She's fucking dead.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Like fucking dead.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Right.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And the only reason I knew she was dead was later because I mean, I thought she was alive

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
because at any moment I thought she was going to pop up and we're pushing her and stuff like that.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And I tried to feel for a pulse and I sort of remember what to do.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And I swear to God, I felt the pulse and there was warmth in her wrist.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And it was, unless I was feeling my own pulse in my fingers, which people do that too.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I don't know.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
But it wasn't until she, like, I don't know anything about it.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I mean, I saw my father dead, but I never saw that this happened.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Like her face turned, it was like a bruise color.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It was a purplish.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It was not natural.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And that's when we knew, like, holy shit, this woman is dead.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And now it's fucking scary.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So we were freaked out.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Marla did not see anything.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
He was asleep.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
He was asleep.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
He's got his little treehouse room on the other side of the wall.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Oh, thank you.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Of course.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Jesus.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I mean, we didn't want him walking in either.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So at all times, I had someone had to be in front of that door just in case he came down.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Like, yeah, he doesn't want some more Cheerios, you know, kind of like TV.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But of course, this morning, Marla, you can watch all the TV you want.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
You go upstairs and you watch TV.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
This is TV morning, right?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You watch as much as you want.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And Marie called the ambulance.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And then all hell broke loose, man.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Is it?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
The ambulance came.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And what we learned later from the report, because it's in the report,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
was that, supposedly, Sabah, Sabah, hate with a B, having to,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000
was talking to Patel at 9.30 a.m. in the morning on a Monday, which is weird.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Because Patel did not, she either did not sleep in that before or this is all a lie.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Okay.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And calls and says, holy shit, there's an ambulance going to Val's and Marie's.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Come over now.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And then she calls Steve.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And Steve comes over.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
So LAPD is there.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The ambulance people are there.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Steve is there.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Patel is there.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And not only is she there, but she is screaming at him.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
He's calling us murderers, saying profanities.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Throwing fucking rocks.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Throwing fucking rocks.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
All right.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
That's how fucking crazy she is.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Not only did she show up, but all the people that hate us in the building are there.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Just like really enjoying this.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Not in the building, but the campus.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And there's a, there's three or four of them.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
You know, and one of them is the management.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
We're in a huge fight with the management.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
A woman named Ashley Madison.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Ashley Madison.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Ashley Madison.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Ashley Madison.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Ashley Madison.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Oh, no, no, no.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I didn't hack that.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Actually, something, she's just a pain in the ass.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And she decided, oh, can I just tell you, police officers that Val, we always thought Val was on drugs.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
We always thought Marie was on drugs.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And Bob, Bob, Bob.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Okay.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And she, and then this guy named Stosh.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And I'll tell you, he's like one of these people that always wished he was a Marine, you know, the types.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
They're like, they wear like the clothes, like they pretend that they were served in Vietnam.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And they pretend they served in Afghanistan, but they never did anything.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And they never even left their town.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And he works at the building too.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
He opens the door for the cars, basically.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
He's like a dormant for cars.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
But the attitude, and he's very, he's got this racist fucking thing too.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And he was there too.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And he said, excuse me, officer, I would like to talk to you in person a little longer afterwards.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Yeah, I know exactly.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
He's just going to talk shit about me.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And I just was like, what the fuck is happening?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
The film crew that's following me around, they came.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And they said, there was so much animosity in the air.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
They said, we knew, and we don't want to tell you this, but we feel like this was the whole setup.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
This was planned.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Like there was people, there was evil there.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
There was something hatred there for you.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
My name's Rocco.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
It wasn't obviously not now.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And I've been told about this, Adore.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
But Rocco Castoro, he was the former editor-in-chief of Vice.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And he's doing a documentary.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
No.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Sorry?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Yeah, I think I saw it on YouTube.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Oh, you didn't?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
It's on?

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Formerly.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Yeah.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Sorry, you have a new channel.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Yeah, anything with some other, some dude named Tim Pool, which I don't know him,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
but I heard bad things.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So I'm trying to distance myself from that name, is what I've been told.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
It's like, well, whatever you do, don't associate yourself with that name.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
But he's financing this project for some reason.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Yeah, trying to recreate Vice magic.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Exactly.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
He was fired, actually.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Yeah.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It was the way he tells the sexual harassment thing that they were covering up in HR.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And it was a whole mess, because the sexual harassment was from wines,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
the head of HR worked for Harvey Weinstein as well.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
This is a whole fucking mess.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
It's like a real fucking crazy shit.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Anyway, don't believe everything Rocco says, because he exaggerates and bellishes a lot.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
But he did say, like, we were not welcome.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
They told us to leave right away.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And not dating the police, the building.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So they had to take all this stuff and go.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And then Marie also said, I felt like we were set up.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I felt like, how did the fuck did Sabah already have a court date ready on the back of her car when she came?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
How is that possible?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
How did she have that court date for Monday?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And I was like, I don't know.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I don't know how DCFS works.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Apparently, the due process is not a thing there.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
There's no such thing as due process.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And that is fucking terrifying.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And if you read that report and you were me, you would see.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
If you could see from my point of view, which I don't know if you'll be able to because you're not me.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
You don't know what I'm like and what Marie's like and Marla's like and Patel and Steve.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It's fucking terrifying that this is in the public record.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And there's a judge that yesterday, the judge heard this.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And I'm sorry.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I'm scared to have Hava, the social worker.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
She comes.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Marie is fucking in tears.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
She is crying.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
She's inconsolable.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
She is barely in our reality at this point.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And this woman comes up to her and says,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
so did you kill her?

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So was it an overdose?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Are you drugs?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Yeah?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Tell me how many drugs did you do today?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And she's like this.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Right there.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And Marie is just uncontrollably sobbing, telling her to fuck off as nice as she possibly can.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
But she's answering the question.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
She's like, no, of course not.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Where's the cleaning supply?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Show me the cleaning.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And the LAPD would not let her in the house.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
So that was good.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
They wanted this woman out there.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Now, I have some footage of her screaming at Marie because the security camera did get a pretty good view of it.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I have not gone through any yet because I've been going through all this other shit.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I will do that later today.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And I'll find out exactly what the fuck happened.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Now, everything was fine.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And the coroner, we had to wait for the coroner.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And the coroner comes in and he's like, he comes in like a superstar.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
He's like, everyone's waiting for the coroner.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
He shows up.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
He's like, well dressed, well groomed.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
He's like, hey guys, I'm here.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And I was like, OK, good.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Interesting.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
He was like a personality, which was strange and interesting.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
And then the whole mood changed.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And all suspicions toward me just sort of dissipated.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
And the guy did his job and he was very thorough.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And he said, Val, here's the case number.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Any questions you call me?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I'm sorry to tell you, but when people die, there's a blood barrier thing in your nose.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And the blood drips out the nose.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So there's blood on the bed.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I was like, no, OK, it's disgusting.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
He said, you're probably going to want to get rid of the sheets.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I was like, yes.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
They will take them for us.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
They can take the fucking sheets, man.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
But Saba, during this time, takes M and gives him the Steve

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
and decides that M cannot be with us.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
She makes this decision.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
She's screaming at Marie.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Marie is inconsolable and she takes M.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
She does not tell Marie, OK, until later.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And then M, and if Marie comes to me, I'm inside talking to police officers.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
She took them.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
They took M.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
They took M.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So I start running out there.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I get to the fucking park and I see M and he's sitting down.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I see Saba and they're going about to approach M.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I see Steve behind her.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Just fucking.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Steve's so sick, he's smiling.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
He's fucking grinning.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
He's fucking smiling.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
He's so happy about this shit.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
And I go there.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I say, you're not taking M.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
No.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
You're not taking M.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I get between her and M and I say, no.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
M just comes with me.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
He grabs my hand.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
OK.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
And Steve is not like this.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Saba is fucking upset.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And she goes, it's like this.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
It makes me work hard.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It's sort of the sigh.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And then she walks over to the police officer and tells him something.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
He comes over.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
It's like, you have to release the child now.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You have to let him go now.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I don't even know who this woman is.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
She comes here.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I don't even see a badge.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I have no paperwork.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I have his card with court date on it.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
OK.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Nothing.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Do you see a badge around her?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
She's just a social worker.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
She's not a fucking officer.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And the guy says, listen, you have to let go of the child now.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So I'm like, OK.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
So M is going to be fine.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
We'll figure it out.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Don't worry.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Et cetera.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Steve takes him off.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Takes him away.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And we haven't seen him since.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Now, we get this fucking shitty lawyer.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Here's a problem.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Sorry.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
It's so convoluted.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
But I just want to make sure you got it.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I want to be thorough.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Right?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I don't want to miss any details.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
This is important.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Marie is so upset that she doesn't care a woman just died on the bed.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
She gets a blanket and just goes on the bed and sleeps.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And I'm like, wow.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I didn't think she had that in her.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I was like, there's some coldness in her.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I'm like, Marie, use that coldness.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Later I am.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
You've got to use that now.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
You cannot lose your shit like you did today with Salva.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Because she was screaming and crying.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And Marie's not a weak woman.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
But something happened at that moment.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
The woman really worked her.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And then we immediately called this woman named Dorothy Gibbons White.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.000
And she is a lawyer that represented a famous friend of Marie's that was an NCIS actress named Zoe.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And she did the most horrendous thing that he could do.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
But you know what?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
She fucking fights dirty.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
She accused the husband of Zoe of being a child rapist.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Like raping the son, Sebastian, every day for like a year or something.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And I'm like, wow.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Let's fuck that.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And Marie's like, fuck that.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I don't think it's true.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I'm like, what?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And I'm like, I don't think it's true.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Like really?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
It's like, we've got to get this woman.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
You need to fucking hire her.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Because now we're so pissed off.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
We need someone to fight dirty.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
So we call her.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And she says, you know, Sebastian got off.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
But he was held for four months in Kentucky.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
The police caught him trying to go across state lines.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
The FBI was involved.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
It's a thing.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
He really is this dirty.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And we start to believe her more.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And we want to believe her.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Right?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Because we want her help.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Because we know that she fights dirty.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
We want some of the fucking women.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
And I'm here at any cost.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Whatever the fucking cost is.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
We want Marlo.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
You know?

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And she starts saying, does Steve ever hang out with JP?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
JP is the name of the guy that's this child rapist.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
And so he was the wife.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000
So if you look at the internet, if you Google those two names,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
you'll see the story.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And as a matter of fact, Steve is friends with this guy, JP.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And all gravitates around this fucking school called Lila.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
And the guy that's the head of that school is named Nordeem.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I filed a police report on him in May for being way too handsy

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
with Marie and all the women at that fucking school

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
and the children.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Because he is grabbing them, hugging them, everybody.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
He's very handsy.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
And it's a French thing to do.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I get it.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
But we're not fucking friends.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
All right?

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And Marlo doesn't like it.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
He does not like it when the guy grabs his fucking shoulder

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
all the time and rubs his back.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
He doesn't like it.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And I tell Marlo, well, tell him not to do it.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You know?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
If I'd see him, I'll fucking tell him.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
But I've never seen him do it.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Marlo tells us.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So I was pissed off.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And on top of that, this guy says to Marie right to email,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Marie wants to have a meeting with the teacher

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
because we're worried about Marlo's work

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
because he wasn't doing his math and work.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
He's lying to us about it.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And she wanted to set up a meeting.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And Nordeem said, he's the head guy.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
The guy that's too handsy says, Marie.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
He's the principal.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
He's the principal.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Yeah.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
He says, Marie, I would go, but you have to go.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I'll tell you when the meeting will be.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And Steve is going to be there.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And Marie says, I'm not.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I can't be in a room with Steve.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I do not want to be meeting with Steve.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I'll do my own meeting.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Steve can do it.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I have his own meeting.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And then he says, and I shit you not, Marie,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
if you don't go to the meeting with your husband,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
I will call Child Services on you.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
In an email.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And we have that email.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
OK.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And then that's when I lose my shit.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
And I fucking call the police.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I said, this guy's harassing us.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
He's being fucking handsy.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
He just threatened my girlfriend.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And what he does with the kids is fucking strange.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Now, take that completely unrelated.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I had no idea that Dorothy Gibbons White, the prosecutor,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
also had a file on this guy.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Apparently, there is something fucking weird shit going on down there.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
How much of it is real?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I don't know.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
How much of it is fake?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I don't know.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Because she is, again, fights dirty.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
But she blends fiction with fact, but she does it well.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And I can't even fucking tell the truth anymore.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
So I don't care at this point.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Maria doesn't care.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
We're going to have to go to that level and accuse Steve

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
of hanging out with a known fucking kiddie fiddler.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
How to file.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
If that's what's going to win, then let's just fucking do it.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So she says, all right.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
But here she says, and I have, and I'm

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
happy if you guys want to take this further and go for it.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Because I have, I recorded all of it.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
So you have her on tape saying to Marie,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
do you think Marlo, could you get Marlo to say this?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Could you get him to say this?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
She's like, probably.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Yeah.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
This is what we need Marlo to say.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And Marlo's eight.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
She's fucking saying that on the phone.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
She says, if I were you, it was my family,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I would want Mike Kratzmer to represent me.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
It's like a mafia down there.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But he's in the mafia, but he's like a spy.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
He's a good guy.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I'm like, OK.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So that's the guy we call.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
He immediately wants $15,000.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And he is a fucking piece of work.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And he's the worst lawyer I've ever fucking seen.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
He's the one that reached out to jamming

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
and said he was representing me.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
All right.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
No, there's one thing I missed.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I thought it was $15,000.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
No, we did not.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
No, not at all.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Fuck yeah.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
That's $700 an hour for three days of work.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And what he did on Monday was nothing.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
He did not say a fucking, he did not defend us.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
He said, I don't even have to show up on the camera.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
OK.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Just Marie's going to sit there.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
So I set up this whole thing with lights,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
beautiful.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
And you have to call him.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Yeah, you have to call him.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Yeah.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And a proper camera with a proper lens.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So she looked good.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Like everyone else was looking good, right?

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
But the lawyer, no, he fucked up.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Sent us a link at the last second.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
And she had to do it from her phone.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
It looked terrible.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And we were the only ones, or she was the only one

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
holding the phone.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Everyone else was at their computers.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Well-dressed.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Everything looked good.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And Marie's, we just looked unprepared.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
And Clumsy Inn just, it was terrible.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And the lawyer did not defend us.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
He did not say that none of this is true.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
He didn't say that the teal was crazy.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
He didn't say that Steve was using this as a tool for anything.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
He just said one thing.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
He said, all I ask is that the child is not sleeping

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
in the same bed as the father.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And I say, oh shit, I know who he's going for.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I know who he's building up, what he's going to build up to.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
But he doesn't defend us.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
And that's when I start losing, then I start texting him

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
and say, what are you doing?

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
You didn't put anything into evidence.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
You didn't mention anything about all these disdainless litany

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
things I've sent him.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And he just screams at me and tells me,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I'm not listening to him.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
If I was a brain surgeon, would you tell a brain surgeon

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
what to do?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
You know, et cetera, et cetera.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And then it was just-

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Did you submit a brief to the court?

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I don't know.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
We don't even have it.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
As far as I know, he submitted nothing.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
He said he didn't give the court anything.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
He just asked the late, did you read the documents?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And she says, not yet, give me a few minutes.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
That's all I remember.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And then she read the documents.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And then she said, I want to see this guy dial.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Because I'm painting out to be this controlling, fucking asshole

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
that is like, you know, Marie is too weak to speak for herself.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And Marie is so fucking sick of hearing from men telling her

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
how weak she is that she needs another man to speak for her.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Like, if you guys don't ever tell that to her,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
because she's slacking.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
All right.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But that's how she's painted out, not only by Steve,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
but by everybody.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
All right.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And now I am the controlling Spangali that is controlling her.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
For what purpose?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I don't know.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
You know, it's not like she has money.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
There's nothing I want.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
I'm trying to get for her.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
But apparently this is what I'm painting out.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
There's one more important thing after that.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
It's where I forget.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
It's really important.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Lori, the woman, she took out the garbage once.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I wish there was one more than one.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
But there was this one time, I think it was Saturday.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
There were three of that.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Lori's the one who passed the law.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Yes.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Yes.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
But three different bags of black garbage.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And I wasn't, this is told to me by Marie.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
It's the second hand.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Marie will tell you the full story, much better than me.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And Marie felt something was wrong.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Something suspicious, because she was watching the bags

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
from upstairs, which she thought was great.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So Marie said, I'll just take these bags out.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And Marie and Lori was trying to tell her,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
no, don't do what I'll do.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And she's like, no, that's okay.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I'll take them out.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And I think M goes with her.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I don't remember.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
She goes outside.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
She opens the garbage.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And in Garbage Bag A are my files from when

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I was in Cook County, foster care.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
It's a stack of this big that I got when David was

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
doing my background.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And so we got all this stuff from Cook County in Chicago.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And it's a huge stack of papers of my own,

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
tired childhood, in the misery of it all.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Included in that is a notebook that I wrote in,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.000
like poems and songs from when I was like 16 or 17.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And there was another screenplay that was really

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
terrible, shitty screenplay, but I don't know

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
why she chose that.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
But you had to go to get this file.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
You had to know where they were.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
They were in my library.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And you have to go and scrap them.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
It was not something that was accessible.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Now bag number two was the same thing,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
but for M.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
It was M's school assessments,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
all the teacher assessments, all his grades,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
everything he's ever gotten from school.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It's all in this one dossier sort of thing.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
In the third bag, there wasn't anything interesting.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
She said there was, there might have been something,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
but not like this, something else.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And so Marie flipped out, you know,

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
what this means.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I still don't know what this means.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It's very strange.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So she was taking out the trash,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
but it hadn't gone all the way yet?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
No.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Well, she was going to steal it.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So she was pretending, this is how she was going

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
to get the papers out in the garbage cans,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
in the garbage bags, and then pretend that she was...

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Yes, yes, this stage.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
And that's why maybe she was going to her car all the time.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
And we found out that she did steal some shit from us,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
which is funny enough, the Crystal Jewelry.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I shit she not, I shit she not.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
She stole the fucking Crystal Jewelry that M made.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Yes.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Okay.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So that's the short version.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Yeah?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Cleaning up.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Cleaning up.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Yeah, and then I got...

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Actually, yesterday, I got a text from Rocco,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
who's the guy...

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
The film...

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
The film...

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Yeah, the ex-Vice News guy.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
He said...

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
He did some background on Lori,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and he said that she was...

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Rocco.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Okay.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
It's Lori Roth, date of birth, 117, 1960.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
She has an extensive criminal history,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
breaking and entering, distribution and trespassing.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
If your neighbor was watching M

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
and claiming he had bruises around the times,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
we were shooting, I can refute that with footage.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Okay, let's...

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Yeah, she claimed that he had bruises and a black eye.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
That M had a fucking black eye.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Never.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Never.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Never.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Never.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
He never had bruises other than falling off his bicycle.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
You know, his scraped knee.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
What did the judge finally decide on Monday?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
The judge said...

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
The judge said, okay, great.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So, I want to see this Val person.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Can we please see Val?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And so, he recalls me and I sit down.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
I don't say a word,

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
because our lawyer says, don't talk.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
So, I listen to the lawyer.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
And she looks at me.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
There's a pause for like three or four seconds,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
and she says, I'm going to recommend

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
that the child does not see Val Brooksman at all

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
and has minimum visits with the mother.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Minimum visits.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Minimum.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Like, the bare minimum that they have to...

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
The minimum.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
They could give away a few hours, three days a week.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
You know?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Is there a deadline that someone not acquires

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
or wouldn't go back to court?

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Nope.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
We had no paperwork.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
We did nothing.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I had no paperwork from anyone.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
No one from fucking DCF asked.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
From the courts.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Nothing.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Can you tell me on September 29th,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
you guys have the follow-up hearing

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
where they'll make a more firm decision?

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Or is that...

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Yeah.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
So, on September 15th,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I thought that was the court,

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
that if it's not,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
it's when the investigator has to hand in his paperwork.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And then the next trial date is the 29th.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And if there's no amicable decision made,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
October 1st is the real trial,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
like a trial trial,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
where people will get witnesses,

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
like the television or something.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Okay.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So, yeah.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
So that's...

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
All right.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
The short version.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
It's pretty crazy.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
It's like the cop said,

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
he's like,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
you got hit with a double wham.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
A double wham.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And that's been stuck in my head ever since.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
He was very right.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
He was a double fucking triple wham.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Sorry.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I'm sorry.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Speak my language.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
How often does that film feature,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
you know, sector guys?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Not often.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Not anymore.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So they've filmed...

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So David Enrich,

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
you know,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
he tried to get a film deal

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
during this whole thing,

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
very unethical,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
and he held on to...

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You probably don't want to hear any of this shit,

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
but I'll tell you anyway,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
because it's so fucking political.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
If you're like Tim and Jim,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
you don't want to hear it.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
But Trump has these loans

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
with Deutsche Bank, right?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
And David sat on them

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
for a very long time.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
And I'm like,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
why did you sit on them?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
He said,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
well, Deutsche Bank told me they were fake.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I'm like, no.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
You listen to Deutsche Bank told me.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
He has a deal set up with Deutsche Bank.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It's kind of Eurgen.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I forgot his last name,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
but he's the head of the PR.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It's a, you know,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
scratch on my back,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I'll scratch yours.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And for example,

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
with Tom Bowers,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
remember Tom Bowers?

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Tom Bowers was

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Rosemary Vibraleck's boss

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
at DBTCA.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Rosemary Vibraleck

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
was Trump's private banker

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000
at Deutsche Bank.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
So he died.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
His death was very suspicious.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
It was suicide.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
He hung himself in Malibu.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
It was similar to my father.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Very similar.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
And then the coroner,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
there was a huge problem with the body.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
We couldn't get the police report

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
because the body had melted

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
mysteriously on Christmas Day

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
and they shipped it to Virginia

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
for some reason.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And that's, so we can't,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
it's cause of death,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
no one can tell anyone.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Very fucking weird, right?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Of all the bodies in the world,

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
of all the deaths in the world,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
this is death.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
That is, no evidence.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
It's just fucking strange.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And that was the last time

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I spoke to Jim and Tammy as well.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I bring up Tom Bowers

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
because, why do I bring up Tom Bowers?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Oh, because he knows about the lungs, right?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
That was David's source.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
And I know that can be a whole mean source.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And then when he died,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
David tweeted out,

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
it was a sad day,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Tom Bowers died today.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
He said, he's a good man.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
He's got a family, sir.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
He left out the most important bit,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
suicide, right?

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Because he has to deal with

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Deutsche Grange.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
They said, do not imagine the suicide.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So it was myself and Scott Steadman.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I told Scott about it.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
And Scott is a,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
he's like a Twitter,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
forensic music,

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
he runs this thing called forensic music.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
It's like a Twitter phenomenon.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
It's like 20 years old,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
he's got a million followers.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Because he handles

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
the Trump-Russia thing really well.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
So I tell him this story

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
and he gets on.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
He's a genius with public information.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
He finds anything in the public domain

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
and he gets the cause of death.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And then we do a story about the cause of death.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And now we're in a battle against David.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
As I've always,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
as I've been since that fucking article came up.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Sorry, that's,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I don't know why

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
it felt that was important

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
for you guys to know.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
So you said David was,

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
you began by saying David was sitting on the,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
sitting on the wall.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Yeah.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
The Trump bill, you know.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
But then,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
forensic news,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
did they have their own?

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I mean, I guess the,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
the George Bank of data,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
seems like you shared it with Tim,

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
with Tim and more?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I did.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I gave it to Tim and Jeremy.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
And then,

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
David also had a copy of it.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
No, I never,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I never gave David a full,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I would never,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I do not,

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
you know,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I gave him a doc,

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
a selective amount of documents.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
But then,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
he's had the Trump data.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
No.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
No, no, no.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
So how did,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
how did David know about it?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Tell him about it.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Okay.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Now, if you remember,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
there was a guy,

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
he's a pundit,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
he's like a liberal-ish,

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
not Chris Matthews,

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
but,

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I can't remember his name.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
But he went on the air one,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
one night and said,

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
ladies and gentlemen breaking news,

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I have the Trump loan documents,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
from the Russian banks.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And they are very well,

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
very much exactly what you thought,

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
you guys all thought.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Stay tuned,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
et cetera, et cetera.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Next day,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
he says,

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
ladies and gentlemen,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I have to retract my statement,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
from the other night.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I don't have them.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Turns out they were fraudulent.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And so,

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
what the fuck.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And Deutsche Bank's lawyer

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
has got ahold of this guy.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
He's a famous name,

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I just can't,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
it's not coming to my mind.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
And told him that

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
these are fraudulent documents

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
and if you go,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
you're gonna fucking see the shit out of you,

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
you're never gonna work again.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
And that's what you got scared

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
and backed out.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Now there are some fraudulent documents

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
out there,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I've seen them on Scribd.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
They're terrible,

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
frauds,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
but these aren't the ones.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
These are different documents.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Fraudulent documents are more...

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Not in my data set.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Not just Deutsche Bank.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Well,

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
my data set's grown substantially

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
since 2014,

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
but it's not from my data set.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Please.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
It's like no one's talking about

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000
the best way that we can help people.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
There's a couple options right now

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
that we already have to talk about a little bit

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
as far as the investigator goes, right?

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
What are the allegations against you?

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I mean, I know we've talked about all of them,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
but you have like some where you've,

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
like if you see the lack of food

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
and you have cell phones everywhere.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Yeah, I don't really know what the allegations are,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
other than drug addicts.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
You know, but it's easy to call them drug addicts.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I am very open about my past.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Right.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
You know, I've taken drugs.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
It's a big deal.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
You're not undergoing now,

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
because you said you know a drug test.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Yes.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
So that should be,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
that should probably solve itself, right?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
It should, but it doesn't.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It didn't,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
because then the,

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
our lawyers just don't take any drug tests,

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
don't talk to them if they call,

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
you hang up.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
If they're at the door,

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
you don't open it.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
They're like, okay, fine.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Do you recommend that safe thing?

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I don't know.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Well,

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
he's the lawyer.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I just decided,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
he knows more than me.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
So I trust him,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
blindly,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
until yesterday.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
My,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
my,

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
so that's what I did.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And that was stupid of me.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Very fucking stupid of me.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
And Marie did the same thing.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And if I had not trusted him,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Marie would not have trusted him.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Does Marie also get a drug test

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
after her work you said?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Yes,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
randomly.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Yes.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
I would imagine that.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
It wouldn't be a huge issue,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
because if Marie already got a drug test,

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
there would be one after the last.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Right.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And it's perfectly okay to go with your own doctor,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
because you don't trust these DCF people

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
and give your own fucking drug test.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
You're overseen by doctor,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
and your doctor will hand it to you.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
That's fine too.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I read it online.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
But the Saba woman would not allow that.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
She didn't want that.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And I also said,

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000
no,

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Saba,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and I have it on the table.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Saba,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I said I was willing to take a drug test.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I didn't say I was going to be there

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
at 3.30

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
and Beverly Hills

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
on fucking Friday.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
That I did not say.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
It was,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
well,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
you know that if you don't take a test,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
it's going to,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
that means that you are called,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
quote, dirty,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
they call it.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Well,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
that's a,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
well,

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
you know that's a bunch of bullshit.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
It's a lie.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Why would you do that?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
That's just the way it is.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Can she get what you want

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
in Beverly Hills?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
She said anytime between nine

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
and five

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
on a Friday,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
on Friday,

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
yes,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
in Beverly Hills.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Okay.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And then I was,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
we're both ready to go

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
until Thursday night

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
before police come.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Okay.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And then we're pissed off.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
And we're like,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
you know what?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I'd help that Mike

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
recommend not.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Yes.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Yes.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
So it's like,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
you know,

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
we weren't even supposed to call her

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
and say no,

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
we're just,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
but we picked up the phone

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
or stupidly even talked to her.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
But this woman is,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
it's like,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000
something's wrong.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Something's really wrong.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
We don't know what it is.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I know what I don't know,

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
which is a substantial.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Are you guys,

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
do you guys know anything even,

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
that I don't know?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
What can you help me with this?

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
What is happening?

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000
I don't know.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I don't know.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I don't know.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I have no idea.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
No one's told me anything.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Even Mike,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
the lawyer is supposed to be

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
the greatest ever.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
He doesn't,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
he told me shit.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
He fired him.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
That's right.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Interesting.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Do you guys have things

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
for another lawyer?

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Well,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
that's what I was going to find

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
out today.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
See what you guys can do.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And if you could save us,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
you know,

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
you know,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I don't know.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I don't know.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I don't know.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I don't know.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I don't know.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I don't know.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I don't know.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
If you could save us,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
you know,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
$15,000,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
it would be great.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
But I'm trying,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I have to gauge what you can do

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
to see if I need a lawyer.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
That's why I'm

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
making this right now.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So not only you're gauging me,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
but I'm gauging this.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
It's a tough call.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Like,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
we're not going to send

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
an FBI lawyer to represent me.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Right.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
The things we can do,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I mean,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
if there's a question of money,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
sometimes we can

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
get you some money.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
But obviously I can't.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
We have,

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.040
You know, obviously, we're not wealthy, but we can do this.

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.440
Yeah, remember what you were saying,

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.160
and I mean, you've missed your wealth yourself.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.560
You said trade didn't end one time.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.960
Yeah, I mean, I've lost more than you made, but yeah, I got it.

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:16.160
You know, don't tell, don't tell Mary.

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.160
You're doing the last few more.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:24.000
Actually, that's probably my best, when crisis, time, and crisis.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.920
So there's that type of stuff.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.360
The other thing that we talked about, too, is we have to keep

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.600
our relationship secret.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.680
Yeah, that's the only way that we can do it.

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.320
So if, you know, I call a shop, stop, or something like that,

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:39.880
and say, hey, we've got the deal, so we'll tell you why you want to know.

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:40.240
Sure.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.320
You have to stay small on it, right?

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.840
So our relationship with you is going to be limited in scope, right?

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.560
Like we talked about, it's likely going to be something where, you know,

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.320
it's going to be something.

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.840
You know, I look at electronic cigarette thing, I just can't believe it.

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.800
Are you going to know all this smoke, electronic?

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.720
Really? Inside?

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.520
It's just, but it's not real.

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.680
I'm not aware of it.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:08.240
So the main thing that we would call it, the main thing that we would be able to

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.040
help with is, like, everything's going well, right?

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.120
We can't change what's going on in the past, right?

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:17.440
Because we can't change what, you know, Isala said, or what your neighbors have

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.240
said, or anything.

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.440
Sure, right.

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.040
But going forward, we can help you with the investigator, right?

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.640
Because the investigator is going to assess you and Marie to see if you

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.920
get the two full parents.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.960
So those are things that we can help with.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.800
I'm trying to think there are other avenues that would like you.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.920
I made a whole list of stuff.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.160
I've been studying law for like a week, okay?

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.200
I'm not a lawyer, but I figured there's some things that they've done very

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.720
illegally, all right?

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.120
Due process still exists, even in that court, all right?

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.920
Even though some lawyers say no, some lawyers say yes, it does exist.

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:53.080
We read online on reputable law websites.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.200
They're not supposed to invite themselves in and walk in.

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.720
They did.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:07.240
This woman is clearly, the lies are so ridiculously, too many lies.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:14.000
And the only reason for that is to paint a picture because you have an agenda.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.800
Why, why she has this agenda?

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.920
Why she wants to destroy me or Marie?

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.840
I don't know, I mean, I get it.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.240
I've encountered people like this before.

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.640
I don't know why they do it, but they want to do it.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.640
It's either, Marie always says I'm going to kill this, you know?

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.160
I don't think it's jealousy.

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.200
I think it's something else.

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.520
I don't know what it is, but there's some reason that she wants us destroyed.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:41.920
And she, and you have to, what I've learned is that this system,

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:45.520
just the DCFS, is very corrupt.

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.200
There's some, they know each other.

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.640
It's ancestral, they all know each other.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:55.280
This guy that worked there, our lawyer and customer, he was threatening Marie.

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.000
Okay, when we left, he fucking threatened her and said, you know what?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.560
If you don't get a vow, because I was calling him out, I said, why didn't you do this?

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.440
If you don't get a vow to stop acting like a bully and know everything,

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.600
you're going to have to make a choice between your son and Val.

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.560
We have that on tape, too.

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.560
You got to hear this fucking, too.

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.560
It's crazy.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.320
Okay.

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:22.520
Full soldier, too, I've dealt with this and other cases that are similar to yours.

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.400
With DCFI?

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.600
With DCFI?

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600
In Texas.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.600
Oh, okay.

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.600
In some organizations.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.440
But we don't, the thing is, I'm not an expert either, right?

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.200
We've worked with some things in the past that have been successful stuff,

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.200
and we actually got some good work out of it.

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.560
Everything turned out fine.

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.960
So that's my experience with it.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.080
I'm not an expert in custody law and now across this work,

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.200
I learn something new every day.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:53.320
So the primary issue I see is this, like, if we're going to help, right,

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:58.120
we're going to help and be effective in our job, but also be effective for you.

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:05.400
So trying to uncover a conspiracy with Saba makes it, like, I mean,

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.120
I don't think there's some weird stuff going on, but that's what I'm saying is that

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.080
if the investigator does his job properly or her job properly,

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.600
they should see that you guys are successful parents who can help raise M

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.000
in a very productive way.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.280
But here's the thing.

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.560
Any competent person, whether you're a DCFS or a police officer,

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.960
anyone that is trained to deal with people,

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.200
can delineate a same person from an insane person, right?

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.840
You should be able to do that.

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:41.400
Now, when you meet Patel and you read her shit, she's obviously fucking nuts, right?

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:44.160
Sorry for this, but clinical terms, she's fucking nuts.

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.320
She's out there.

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:51.760
And for Saba, I know is able to determine the difference between saying and not saying.

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.440
So she purposely, I suspect that she's a smart person,

01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.960
that she purposely included this woman's testimony for a reason.

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.680
She's against it, because she must know that she's fucking nuts.

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:05.680
They're using her.

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:08.360
It's sad for this woman.

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.640
I'm not that sympathetic for her anymore because she's did it, but it's, you know what I mean?

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.600
I'm not saying it's very simple.

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.920
It's the first time I've heard it.

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:19.680
So you're saying that she's clinically insane, right?

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.600
She's got a frontier bipolar.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.320
Maybe not insane, but that's exaggeration.

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.240
Mentally unstable, for sure.

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.120
Classic bipolar.

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.240
I'm willing to bet you anything you'll find bipolar medication.

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.840
But just for reference, right?

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.560
We probably wouldn't want to make that claim, right?

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.920
You would, yes.

01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.360
Or you would not.

01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:44.040
Because if it's one, easy to tell that someone is clinically insane, and two,

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.280
you know that she's insane, and three, why would you give custody to her

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.960
for several hours a week?

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.000
Because we didn't know it at the time.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.840
He just hurt himself, right?

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.800
So like, you know at the time, he's same argument to the lady with the investigation.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.880
So that's an avenue I think would be dangerous for you than anything else, right?

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:04.560
So we get her to retract her statement.

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.240
Well, here's the thing.

01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:10.120
So again, are we going to go over there and break her off to retract the statement?

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.520
Yeah, I'm ready to go to the Armenian.

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.920
I'm like, let's go find the Armenians.

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.040
They handle this shit, right?

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.560
Luckily, we're lucky for you.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.200
The FBI doesn't do that, right?

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:25.520
I mean, we are on the side of good because we're not going to influence people in that way.

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.480
It's just not how we work.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:29.080
And like I told you on phone, I'll be honest with you.

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.480
What we can and what we can't do, I'm not going to make a story for you to say like,

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.640
oh, we can turn the world around immediately for you right now.

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.440
No, I know.

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:36.960
I know.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.800
I don't expect that.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.880
But I'm trying to work with you to see what avenues we can best help with.

01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.720
So like I said, the best thing I can think of right now is influencing how you're perceived.

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.360
And not in a negative way, not in a way that's illegal or anything, but just saying like,

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.760
hey, if you have these issues, if you have, they say, oh, there's not enough food in the house.

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:04.040
And then we just show receipts, you get an Amazon delivery every week or something like that.

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.720
Yeah, we have the receipts.

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.920
So all those things would be easily refuted by evidence that you can show.

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.520
And there's no evidence that the FBI is helping you or, you know, if we give you money to do that,

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.920
that's just cash that you have, right?

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.920
So all those things are ways that we can help your view in the court size.

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:27.720
Because what we talked about too and what we talked about on the phone is that it's very rare

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:30.680
that they take custody completely away from the parent.

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:35.080
It can happen in very extreme cases, but at least the ones that I've been involved in,

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.960
the judge almost always favors.

01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.640
And what we talked about, the mom almost wouldn't have a father or whatever.

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.400
I believe that you believe that.

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.920
But what I've read and studied in the last few days about this specific system in Los Angeles

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.640
and these people, it's not that.

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.560
It's the opposite.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.920
They give it to the perpetrator.

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:56.760
They give it to the person that has the most money or the person that's been doing the illegal fake calls.

01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:02.560
Because this is, obviously you can imagine, this is a tool used in many, many divorces.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.400
That's the complicated part of it.

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:10.000
And I have not experienced in this, but just, you know, you've had an experience in the past

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.160
and you've been like, this is complicated.

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.320
It's not just a child welfare situation, it's a divorce.

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320
It's weaponized.

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.160
They weaponized DCFS for divorce.

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.960
It's terrible, but that's what's happening.

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:22.760
And they know it.

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.760
And they're using it and making a lot of money.

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:27.160
They're fucking lawyers and judges.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:32.160
Like, for example, Sabah makes $120,000 a year.

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.280
Her supervisor makes 210 public records.

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.480
That's a lot of money for DCFS, right?

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.480
And they have the other $80,000.

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.520
What's other?

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.760
Where did that $80,000 come from?

01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.920
Over time.

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920
$60,000.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.040
Over time.

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.800
And $25,000.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.960
Other $90,000.

01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.360
So what the fuck?

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.800
Is that normal?

01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.800
I don't know, okay.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.240
Anyway, I'm just saying it's suspicious to me.

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.600
But yeah, well, what can you do?

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.800
What can you do?

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.000
What is in your power and what's not?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.880
We have to do some more research, because the issue is what we can do would make it

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.440
over it also, right?

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.920
Also, you don't have a rebuttal either.

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:21.320
We wrote it on the piece of paper, the FPVF thing with like these, then we put sticky

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:24.840
notes on the fake sticky notes on a digital thing.

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.360
Can't find it anywhere.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.200
It only took two days to write it, and now we can't find the sticky notes.

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:31.200
We have to write it again.

01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.200
So we will get you that.

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.200
We will get you that.

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.800
And I haven't uploaded all the evidence yet, like all the recordings that we have and

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:47.280
all the video recordings, audio and video.

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:54.040
So, the last time I checked the email address, I didn't see anything, but that was before

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.040
I left.

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.040
You didn't see anything?

01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.040
No.

01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.040
I sent it to you.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:02.400
I sent it to that email address on Sunday night, and I checked on Monday to get anything

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.400
yet.

01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.480
But you don't, this should be, I sent you like a shitload of stuff last night, last night.

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480
Oh, last night?

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480
Yeah.

01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.480
Okay.

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.480
I haven't checked it.

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.480
Oh, okay.

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480
Because I haven't been flying in a year.

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.480
It's okay.

01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:16.480
I sent you the text saying, I'm sorry, I just saw this now.

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:17.480
Yeah.

01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.480
That's what I'm saying.

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480
Yeah.

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.480
I haven't checked whatever it is you sent.

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480
Okay, good.

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.480
Okay.

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.480
You've got a lot, there's a lot of reading in there.

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480
You'll see.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.480
But you've read the report, though.

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:30.480
I don't have, if you sent the report in that group, I haven't read it yet.

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:31.480
The good report?

01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.480
No.

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.480
So, yeah, I just have a good report.

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480
Oh, good.

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.480
Okay.

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:36.480
So, you sort of, oh, good.

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.480
I got to you first.

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.480
That's good.

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.480
So, you get your first impression from me first.

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.480
Not that report.

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.480
That's a good sign for me.

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480
Very happy to hear that.

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.480
That's good.

01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:48.480
So, we can do some more research on our insights, see what thing you have.

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.480
Good.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.480
I can't promise anything else, but I cannot promise my own right.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.480
Like, I can't promise that I mean you don't need all of that help at all.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480
That's good to me.

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.480
But I can't tell you I'll be honest, right?

01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.480
I'll be honest with you about what we can do and what we can't do.

01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:02.480
And, I'll give you some options sometimes and say, well, we can try this and try that.

01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:05.480
It may include to different ways.

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.480
But I can't promise what I promise what we can do.

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.480
I got that.

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:12.480
Um, Look, what do you want if you want it?

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:19.960
What did you have on there that you wanted to show up?

01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:22.080
Seriously, it will be here all week.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.000
OK, can you even find it in summary,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.520
like the overview of what you see?

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.000
Do you like political shit?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.280
Or do you like give me a genre?

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.200
I work in cyber crime.

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.040
Oh, you do?

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.840
OK, that's what I thought.

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.600
You read it on that article, I know.

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.080
So you're going to do that part, right?

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.520
So I work in cyber crime.

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.800
So we look for hackers.

01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.360
We do ransomware, or BTC, and jacking.

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.360
Oh, you do?

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.360
Really?

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.160
Yeah, we do much other stuff, like computer issues in general.

01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:55.640
I do some stalking pieces.

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.120
Do you have all the toys in tact shit, too?

01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.440
I've got a lot of toys.

01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.200
Oh, really?

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.000
OK.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:01.520
But yeah.

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.800
Dude, OK.

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.720
Do you need like an apprentice?

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.720
All right.

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.320
Do you want to come out to QC and see all the toys we have?

01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:13.640
In our hand presses, and then you ask the whole band to give them out.

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.040
Well, yeah, OK.

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.600
OK, yeah, well, I can help you.

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:18.880
I'm a self-taught hacker.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:19.840
I'm not very good.

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.480
I did not hack Sony, OK?

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.640
I did not do that.

01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.240
They was accused of that, but I did not do that.

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.080
The stuff on DDoS Secrets, I was stupid enough to say,

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:33.280
I'm like, can you actually give me credit for my stuff?

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.400
Can you put my name?

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.880
I'm the only idiot that said, here, put my name on it.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.800
But MPS, Monty Duposky, that was not a hack of the documents

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.000
were given to me by the Anatella Rossi.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.320
So it was not a hack.

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:50.840
And she said, I want you to make this public as possible,

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.320
because we dated Rossi's story out there.

01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.480
So I said, of course.

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.960
And she knew I had connections with New York Times,

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.760
and most returnals, and that's what she wanted.

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.680
So I helped her, and Luca was her lawyer.

01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.560
It seems like a very, like you walk in one light bulb

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:10.600
on this old ancient desk, smoking a cigarette,

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:15.720
speaking Italian, perfectly safe of a lawyer.

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.760
He also wanted all this everywhere.

01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.280
He wanted me to disseminate as much as I could.

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:22.600
We had a deal.

01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.960
I said, if you can give me anything in McKaylee Faisola,

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.560
anything in my father, anything you got,

01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.120
I'll give you whatever I have.

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.200
And I don't really, let's look for David Rossi.

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.200
I don't have much in here.

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.320
If you want to do it, you can do it right now.

01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.520
So that was our trade.

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:39.400
And man, I told you in town, but he told me

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:42.040
the craziest fucking story.

01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:44.680
It'll take a long time to tell you the story.

01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.040
The short version is that Monty Duposky, the Calabria mafia,

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:54.560
is using MPS to launder their money.

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.120
And they're using it in very interesting and creative ways,

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.520
like putting cash in basketballs for the Italian basketball

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.080
team.

01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.400
Literally, they'll have basketballs filled with cash.

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:09.600
And then they give the basketballs to some other team.

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.520
They trade them with other basketballs.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.280
And that's how they do the cash exchange.

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.440
Fucking weird.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.920
I swear to God.

01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.440
And we've got David Rossi.

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:19.800
And Anatella says this happened.

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.120
And Luca says this is what happened.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.760
David Rossi would pick up just a briefcase full of cash.

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:26.440
He'd rent a car.

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.640
He would drive from Siena to Lugano.

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.600
And he would just start dumping cash into different accounts.

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.640
And then one guy that picked up the cash count

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:42.840
is Cardinal Scorano from the Vatican, caught on CCTV.

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:43.800
And he's laundering money.

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:46.960
He's got a history of being a dirty banker as well.

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.040
So this is very interesting.

01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.480
But no one's gone after him the second time.

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:51.920
He's got to go.

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.960
Or has to mention that he doesn't go.

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.240
Both of them.

01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.600
And how do you know what to tell him?

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.640
I went over and then visited her.

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.320
When I was a, it's a really, it's another story

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:06.040
if you want to have a story time.

01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:09.680
But I was trapped in Amsterdam.

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.760
Like literally trapped in a fucking campsite.

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.240
Someone broke into my rental car and stole,

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:19.120
like I had this computer in black case, Macbook,

01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.840
and it was underneath the passenger seat.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.600
And it's the dead of night in Amsterdam.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.000
Like 3 AM, I'm going into town and I buy some cigarettes.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.080
So I leave the car for a little, maybe 10 minutes.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.240
And I walk back and cobblestone streets and I see glass.

01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.840
I say, oh, poor fucker, guys, car broke in.

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:36.880
It's mine.

01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.800
No, they did not take my passport.

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:42.560
They did not take my 30 or 40 euros.

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.040
You know, sitting in that little tray between the passenger

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.120
and the driver's mind.

01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.200
They didn't take my fender strad in the back seat

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.400
or anything else.

01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.480
They only took that computer, which I have a dutch bank

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:55.840
stuff that I had just bought in New York City

01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:57.400
a month and a half prior.

01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:00.680
And I just organized all my dutch bank shit,

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.240
all the files on that computer.

02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.080
It was encrypted.

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.720
There's no way anyone can get to it.

02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.520
And anyone that would pull off something like that,

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.360
it's got to be a shitty private investigator.

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.760
There's no, anyone that's sophisticated

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:12.800
would have just fucking hacked it, you know,

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.600
or given up on anyone saying it was encrypted.

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.440
There's no way in.

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.640
It was air gap, I forgot to say.

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:17.480
There's no way.

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:20.080
But that's the only thing that was taken.

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.240
And I suspect dutch bank hired a private investigator.

02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:24.640
That's where I think.

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.000
In Prague, I thought I was gonna die

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.560
when this guy, Italian thug, pulls me out of the car

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.000
and starts beating on me.

02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:38.040
And he doesn't speak a word of English.

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.440
I just came to buy some car to the mall in Czechoslovakia.

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.920
Have you ever been to a mall in Prague?

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.400
It's fucking weird.

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.480
It's a weird place.

02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:47.720
I once died on a train.

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.880
Oh, in Prague?

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.200
What happened?

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.040
I got to get off.

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:51.880
No, no.

02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.440
I ended up in a train.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.280
That's not good.

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.600
It was not good.

02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.880
No, it was like, it was bad.

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.120
Yeah, I hit the SOS button in the car, like,

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.520
help, I'm being murdered.

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.800
This guy's gonna murder me.

02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.320
And I forgot, I had bought a fake gun,

02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.880
like a BB gun in Germany.

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.840
And I never, I don't know anything about guns,

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.560
but I should have used it.

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.800
Maybe he would have run away,

02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.080
but I forgot it was in the fucking apartment.

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.320
So instead I'm just like, I use my phone.

02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.320
Look, you're on camera.

02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.600
Stop kicking me, stop this.

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.160
You're being on camera.

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.720
And the SOS, here's it all.

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.040
And next thing I know, the fucking SWAT teams.

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.120
They got machine guns, there's six of them.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.160
And they surround us, and they tell the guy,

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.800
he has fucking hands up, and I'm like,

02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:34.400
that's the guy, we know that's the guy.

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.520
They're speaking English.

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.160
And then the dude does the strangest thing.

02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:42.720
He's surrounded by the SWAT team, with M16s,

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:44.400
wherever those big guns are.

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.680
He takes off his shirt, so you can see he's topless, right?

02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.920
Why does he take off his shirt?

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.160
Cause he's got military tattoos.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.240
This is how he's going to communicate to the Czech police

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:55.640
that I'm one of you.

02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.920
That's what he did in 20 of the time he looked

02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.680
at the EU military, some sort of service.

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.240
And they put down the gun, it works.

02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:04.320
They're like, what is going on here?

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.120
Turns out, we take over the police station,

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:11.800
and like a fucking lady from a central casting,

02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.680
Interpol, shows up, you know?

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:16.640
He's like, I don't want to be here in a sunday or anything.

02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:19.920
Get me, who's this stupid American, you know, sorry.

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:21.440
Turns out he's from Avis rental car,

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.720
and he just came to repo the car.

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.960
That's the fucking crazy shit that it was, man.

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.840
It was a weird time, you know?

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.960
I don't know why I told you that story, but it's fine.

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.480
What was the question?

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.320
Sorry.

02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.160
Let's go back to your hacking system.

02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:35.000
Oh, hacking?

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:35.840
Yes.

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.720
What kind of skills do you know,

02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:38.920
what kind of techniques do you know?

02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.160
Well, I guess my, the only one I pulled off,

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.960
like really successfully was my mother.

02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:48.160
But we had a lot of time in planning, though.

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.320
It was just a man in the middle of watching my hack.

02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:51.200
It was really easy.

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.480
Was it a Wi-Fi fan app or something?

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.920
I have a pineapple, but I did not use a pineapple.

02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.800
I could not, I was like, I had no money, I had nothing.

02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.760
I had to learn how to increase the output of my battery

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.920
power on the MacBook to handle all the fucking thoroughfare

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.720
that was coming in through the,

02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.640
well, I had practiced at this hotel down there.

02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:12.720
They called the, in Venice Beach,

02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.960
but it was a, I spoofed their,

02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:22.560
it's in Manhattan Beach,

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.240
and it was where I learned everything for two weeks.

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.720
Anyway, I spoofed the router,

02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.800
and I learned Wireshark at that time,

02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.400
which was like driving me crazy

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.920
because all I got were the packets,

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.280
but I could not figure out how to put the packets together

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:38.360
and took me, like, maybe I'm slow, I don't know,

02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:39.560
but it took me a while to figure out

02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.040
how to put the fucking packets together.

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.440
And once I did, I was like, shit, I have passwords now.

02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.160
I have some, well, not full passwords,

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.440
they're still broken up,

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:51.920
but you can just put them into a algorithm that will,

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:56.240
yeah, John the Ripper or something,

02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.600
anything that's, actually, John the Ripper won't work,

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.200
it's more like a, I don't know, it's,

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.640
Sorry?

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.800
Rainbow table?

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.520
No, the table one, that's not very easy one,

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:11.440
the table hack, that's the injection one,

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.080
were you in CaliLinux, you're talking about?

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.320
Yeah, it's been a long time since I took that class,

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.520
but I thought you're just running it

02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.040
against a dictionary or something?

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.600
Yeah, well, you are, but you also had an algorithm

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.200
that's specific to what you're looking for.

02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.360
Like, I knew my mom's,

02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:29.120
my mom would have a very specific list

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.400
of names she would use, right?

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.440
So I had to plug in just those,

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.400
and I had to have the, you know,

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.320
anything over eight fucking,

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.360
it's good we can talk a little bit, this is fun,

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.000
anything over eight letters is gonna take over

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.760
a day and a half, unless you have a 20 gig GEX,

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.680
whatever, NVIDIA card, you know,

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.240
that's with Elkumsoft, which is the fastest

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.160
password cracker I've seen so far right now,

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:54.320
on the market, I'm sure you guys

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.960
probably have access to something cooler than that,

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.400
but it takes a long time.

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.400
But it's a lot of it, you just have to use your intuition

02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:03.480
or make a phone call, you know, I didn't say you,

02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:06.800
you know, that's the best way to do it is this,

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:09.960
they call it social engineering,

02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:13.360
so that's the most fun way to do it.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.680
How do you learn, like, do you take classes?

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:17.880
You too, we don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:22.120
I was, you don't understand, my dad just killed himself,

02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.200
my mom cut me out of the family,

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:28.920
I was sequestered to rehab, it was a very nice rehab,

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:32.040
but I was not free, I was like, for four months,

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.520
I'd say that.

02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.640
You're a whole lot more than me,

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.920
I've taken the classes that you and I,

02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:38.680
I don't understand everything.

02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:42.280
But I had to, it was like, if you have no money

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:43.480
and you have to feed yourself

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.960
and someone throws you in a foreign country,

02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.360
you're gonna learn, you know, that's what it was for me,

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.240
it was like, I had to know why my dad killed himself,

02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:51.760
I had to figure it out, I had to get into his email,

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.720
so I just sat down and fucking focused.

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.600
I was impressed, I was like,

02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:57.760
I was planning on killing myself,

02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:00.120
you know what, maybe my mom will learn something

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:01.600
if I die the same year, you know,

02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:03.160
maybe my sister will never have the stuff,

02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:04.800
I was being a martyr, you know,

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.440
I was being a little shit too, being an asshole.

02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.480
And the doctor said, you know what Val,

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.920
we're gonna try and give you out or all,

02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:15.080
let's see what this does, what the fuck that was like.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:17.440
You know, and then I take it, I'm playing,

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.000
three hours like that.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.200
All right, let's learn cocking, you know,

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.320
finance is next.

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:24.880
And you know what, it fucking saved my life that thing,

02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:26.400
it really did, I drugged,

02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:27.560
and people say don't be drugs,

02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.960
but sometimes drugs really work, it shows you.

02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.840
Yeah, if you're depressed, you don't see any hope,

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.720
sometimes the drug will just give you a glimpse

02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.800
and remind you that there is another way

02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:42.240
of viewing the world, you know, that's it.

02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:44.280
But anyway, yeah, I was fueled with out or all,

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.320
it was very helpful.

02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:50.040
Yeah, I found focus, I never, like I was a dumb musician,

02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.400
I thought I had, there's no way I was gonna learn

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.440
how a derivative work, right?

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:57.040
I had no fucking, I was very proud of myself,

02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.600
and I thought my father was very proud too,

02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:01.320
and that's kind of another thing, kind of,

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.960
you know, a little fuel, a fuel to the fire.

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:08.000
So what other things really need to happen?

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.960
Like, do you know anything about ransomware?

02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:14.480
I do, yeah, I stay away from it, it sounds,

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:16.160
I mean, it sounds like it's really,

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.960
it's not, I mean, I've never had anything around somewhere,

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:22.160
but it doesn't seem like a difficult thing to break,

02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:24.200
I mean, it's gotta be localized on the computer

02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:26.480
and you can isolate it, it's not,

02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.080
if you take the computer offline,

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:30.720
it's not like a self-destruct button

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:34.800
that where all of a sudden your computer's gone dead,

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.120
you can isolate the fucking hack.

02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.360
It's just like anything, you know, any virus.

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.640
Well, not like any virus, I don't know much about it,

02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.560
but if someone's putting a foreign code

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.440
onto your computer, it's depending where it is,

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:48.200
and again, remember, there's different types,

02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.640
and with Intel, the new shit we learned about Intel,

02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:53.880
with the hack on the chips, there's a whole new,

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:57.720
it's like a whole new industry, but there's a whole new,

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:02.440
what's the word, like a way to get at data,

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.560
I can't remember the names of them

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.920
because it's, my brain's on 100% today,

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.720
but the ones, the Intel chips, the flaws

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.000
that were found about a year and a half ago,

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.120
do you remember what you know what I'm talking about?

02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:13.960
The vulnerability, thank you.

02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:14.800
What's it called?

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.640
Vulnerability?

02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:17.480
Yeah, but what were the names of the ghost one?

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:18.600
Well, no, no, no, I don't,

02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:21.240
I think the noise might be one of these problems.

02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:22.960
So the things Intel fucked up,

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.120
and from the very beginning when we started making chips,

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120
there was a cache, or a cache, or whether you can,

02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.800
yes, we could get all the credentials back

02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:36.120
from the actual chip, and every single computer

02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:39.240
in the world is vulnerable to this, every single computer,

02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:41.000
and that's fucking amazing, right?

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.080
So that gives you completely new access,

02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.840
and three different companies found this out at the same time.

02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.640
It's like the 100th monkey hearing.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.440
Do you know the thing?

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.280
The 100th monkey?

02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.120
Yeah, the 100th monkey.

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.520
Great, yeah, it's just, the idea has sort of happened.

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.760
But anyway, yeah, that's a whole new way of doing it.

02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:57.760
I know how to do,

02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.160
my best thing is social engineering,

02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.560
and then, you know, I'm not really a coder.

02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:06.400
I don't know how to do it,

02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.160
but I can take other people's programs

02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:11.680
and use them very well, you know?

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:14.200
Elk and Soft kind of pisses me off a little bit.

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.520
These guys, they overdo it, but,

02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.440
I mean, I have magnet, I have Elk and Soft,

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.000
I have the orange one.

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.520
I can't remember, I can't remember what it's called.

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.440
Belk is off, there's no issue, you know what?

02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:30.280
Oh, you know what?

02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:33.160
I'll show you, I'll show you what I got.

02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:35.120
You know, magnet is the best right now.

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:37.440
See, and I'm thinking, like, why go through,

02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:40.800
why do all this extra work you don't need to do

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.040
if you can just get the fucking,

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.240
someone's already built the program,

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:46.200
we'll go out there and invent the wheel, right?

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:51.200
So if, for example, if Elk and Soft, oh shit,

02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:53.360
let me see the options,

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:58.600
if Elk and Soft is already created a way

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:02.040
to get the tar ball off your iPhone 11,

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:04.120
why do I have to create a program

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:04.960
that do the same thing,

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.920
that you've got people that spend a lot of time

02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.080
and money doing it?

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.280
So I'll just use their shit

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:11.240
and improvise with other people's shit.

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.640
Like, the pineapple is not that great, you know?

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.640
It's not that interesting.

02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.520
And also it's a little, it's not user-friendly, you know?

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.520
It's like you have to really sit down and study

02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:25.120
the fucking stick of pineapple and what not to do it.

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.160
So I build a, like a fast way to do it for my girlfriend

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:29.120
because she wanted to know how to do it,

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.520
but she had no patience to sit down

02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:35.520
and learn how to keep the AP or the evil twin thing.

02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:38.520
You know, so I just showed her like a,

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.600
I created like a shortcut for her, which is sort of-

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.840
How did you make it easier for her from Bernie?

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.000
I automated it, yeah.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.400
It's easier if you do that,

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:52.720
because she just does one thing,

02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:55.120
everything falls into place instead of making her,

02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:58.240
it makes her think like she's accomplished something, you know?

02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.120
It's not that hard to just automate, let me see, you know.

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:05.560
Sorry, so let me show you, for example.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.360
Oh, Evan Tree was the other one.

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.920
The other one is her Wi-Fi off, it's Bluetooth off.

02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:11.760
Oh, yeah.

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:13.560
Of course, of course.

02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.600
Your security and ours, but-

02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.240
Oh, really?

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:19.280
You guys got people, interesting.

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.600
Yeah, I mean, I think, sorry, I got all excited,

02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.000
but I forgot that you guys were with the FBI.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Shit, okay, yeah, Wi-Fi's off, Bluetooth is off.

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.120
So let's pull up, like phone breaker,

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.720
Xcode, I can do, I don't know,

02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:43.840
can you be more specific, is there something you're looking for?

02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.360
It's not 10, it says your level of skill

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.080
would like need your help to do something.

02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:47.920
Okay.

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.080
You know, we needed you to look at, you know,

02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.520
vulnerable website or something like that,

02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.040
is that something you could do?

02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:54.880
Oh.

02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:57.080
You know, if we had a phone, we'd be pretty good.

02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.640
The phone I could do a lot better

02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.960
than I could with the vulnerable website.

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:03.320
I could do the website, but it would take me a little extra time,

02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.680
because I have not studied that one as much.

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.840
I mean, I used to do it before,

02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:10.720
maybe when it was easy, when everything was on the server,

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.800
and you could just do it for the back space.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:15.400
Remember, you could just do that stupid thing,

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.440
you know, maybe I could do that.

02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.240
But the phone is more fun for me, that's easy,

02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.040
that's not easy, but it's more of a challenge.

02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.840
Because I did my dad's phone, I did my girlfriend's phone,

02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.920
and then people would find phones on the street for me

02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:29.400
and just sell it to me, it's just like a friend practice.

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.720
It is fun, that's what I like.

02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.360
And the remote stuff is,

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.160
well, am I gonna get in trouble

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:40.240
for telling you guys something this short?

02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.920
He told me like you murdered someone,

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:42.960
they probably didn't believe you.

02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.800
I never murdered anybody, okay?

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.520
No murder, okay?

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.120
The New York Times asked me to hack Epstein.

02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.160
Okay, so they didn't want me to hack Epstein.

02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.200
So I did it, and everyone's very,

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.120
I didn't, oh sorry, I didn't do it.

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.280
I started the process of doing it,

02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.400
and I gave him the list of passwords,

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.440
and I gave him the list,

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.200
and I have this on email to prove to you,

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.680
okay, the passwords, and I gave him the list of logins,

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:13.440
that's it, all the credentials.

02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.360
And I gave him the Gislane's credentials as well.

02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:19.840
I did not break in, I did try, okay, made an attempt,

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.320
but it was a double authentication,

02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.440
someone already got to it.

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:26.660
I don't know whose number it is,

02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:28.920
but I have a phone number if you wanna trace it,

02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.480
it would be helpful for you guys.

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.640
And I found out a lot, for Kevin Hall,

02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.720
actually, I did this one in the morning.

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:40.800
I know someone who's running around, so.

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.640
Oh, Kevin Hall is doing this one in the morning,

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.600
and he's a partner with me,

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.360
she wrote the Epstein story.

02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.640
Yeah, she's really good, really good, yeah.

02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:59.880
I didn't wanna know if someone was running around,

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.520
but I helped him by just looking at his old email addresses

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.440
from like 1999, old banks that he used in old,

02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:13.520
just old accounts, and lawyers that he used as well,

02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:16.120
because a lot of the lawyers are hiding some money too.

02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:18.760
Stuff like that, yeah.

02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:24.000
Just, you know, I usually don't give away a secret,

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.240
but I'll give you a secret,

02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.360
and it'll make it seem so mundane and obvious to you,

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.320
you'll think like, why didn't I think of that?

02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:31.280
It's the easiest possible way to start,

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:33.960
and mostly, people ask you to find a password,

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.240
this is the easiest thing to do.

02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:38.960
You just get a database of the billion or so

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:40.600
already hacked files,

02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:43.480
you find the old password that somebody used,

02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:45.600
and you just sort of engineer from there,

02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.760
it's not that hard, yeah.

02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.280
A lot of people don't change their passwords,

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:52.160
and when they do, they make a variation.

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.000
That's all you have.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:53.840
Right.

02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:57.720
I used to usually work alone, you work with other people?

02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:02.720
No, no, I don't understand how you work with,

02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:07.200
I mean, teach me, there's a way to work with other people,

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.280
yeah, teach me, because usually, I don't know,

02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:12.080
like usually it's one person doing all the work,

02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.960
and the other person is watching, so, I don't know.

02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.440
But yeah, I'd like to, I would love to try, I mean.

02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.080
Yeah, like I said, right now I'm completely list of stuff

02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:27.680
that like, okay, we could use help on this,

02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:29.320
so it's maybe something that we could do.

02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:31.360
We could try to find a spot for you, still.

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.160
I feel like it's that, I guess, on my head.

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.200
What I'm really good at doing is I could find

02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:37.920
stolen money and money laundering.

02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:39.280
If someone needs to move money,

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:40.680
I can show you how to do that.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:44.080
I know how to, I know people that can reverse engineer,

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.160
there's a word for it, Bitcoin wallets?

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.920
Reverse growth, what do you call it?

02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.840
Well, how do they, how do they,

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:54.320
I mean, if they're gonna track where the Bitcoin goes,

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.200
no, they can find, no, how, where it came from.

02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:00.840
They can do the whole scrub, they call it,

02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:03.000
it's not scrub, it's called the,

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.240
they're watching it now, like you're telling,

02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:08.840
because it's all public, so that you can see

02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:09.720
where it goes to and from,

02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:11.400
you mean after it's been tumbled or something?

02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:12.720
After it's been, yes.

02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:15.240
Not tumbled, after it's been put into any wallet.

02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:18.640
They can trace it, like a reverse trace.

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:20.600
There's two people I know that can do it.

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:22.600
That part's not too difficult, I'll tell you.

02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:23.440
It's not, okay.

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:24.920
Oh, you can?

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.400
Okay, I don't know anything about it.

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.880
And it's just like the ledger is public,

02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:30.040
so you can see where the money comes and goes to.

02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.160
It's just that this number means nothing.

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.320
Oh, no, but it's not that simple.

02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.160
I mean, yeah, I know there's an open ledger,

02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:42.600
but it's also, there's like a wallet

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.400
that has self-account as well,

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.480
so you have to find out where it, yeah.

02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.800
It's like, they know how to do that.

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.080
They can, they can,

02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.160
I'm not sure what the wording is.

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.040
You see, that would be nice.

02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:57.280
I would like to know what the terms are for these things.

02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:59.360
I know how to do it, I know what the action is,

02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:02.320
but I don't know the term, the term, the terminology.

02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:06.960
Okay, so what other stuff do you have access to?

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:09.240
I mean, because you have access to a lot of journalists, right?

02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:10.600
And here's the thing.

02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:12.720
I don't really want to deal with journalists

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.200
because it's the first-minute stuff that's there.

02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.360
Journalists have a lot of data.

02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:20.560
They're a very untapped source of data.

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:22.560
You know, if you know how to say the right thing,

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:25.080
you can get all, I got the guys in Russia,

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:27.520
there was a spy on trial,

02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.800
he's a banker spy, and I got the guy

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.040
to send me the whole fucking transcripts,

02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:33.040
court records, everything.

02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.360
You mean the journalist was able

02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.280
to get the court records in 2017?

02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.960
Yes, okay, yes, interesting.

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.760
Journalists have a lot of shit,

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.560
and they just sit on it and just goes,

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:45.000
once the story's done, they forget about it.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:45.920
They don't need it anymore.

02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:50.080
So there's a huge fucking great source of information.

02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:52.840
Nobody even bothers to get it.

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:54.760
But I know so many journalists now,

02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:56.400
and they're sending me shit all the time.

02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:58.800
People, I just have this guy named,

02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.720
well, I'm not gonna tell you his name,

02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.920
because that would be kind of weird.

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.160
It would be weird to do that, too.

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:05.880
But he just found me on Twitter and said,

02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.880
Val, I think that there's some shady shit

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.000
going on in the Bank of Ireland.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.360
Can you take a look at this one?

02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.920
And I guess, I take a look at it,

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:17.920
and lo and behold, Wilbur Ross stole $35 billion

02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.280
from Bank of Ireland.

02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.960
Well, Wilbur Ross and his compatriots,

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.960
but 23, he calls them hedge funds because they're not hedge

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:31.160
funds, they're more like LSEs.

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.560
But 23 of them that he owns, Wilbur Ross owns, okay?

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.520
Bank of Ireland hid $35 billion in promissory bonds, sorry.

02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.920
He bought a portion of that bank for 1% for like,

02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.000
like something so touchy, like a couple billion dollars.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.840
And his, that share gave him access to $35 billion,

02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:57.720
which he pulled out, and it's fucking amazing.

02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:58.680
It's amazing.

02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.000
So look, I get shit like that,

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.440
but then I get the weird spy people, you know?

02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.400
Like the crazy people, they're not crazy.

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.640
They're, sometimes they're reading a script.

02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:09.440
Like, I don't know if they're intelligence

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:11.000
from corporate intelligence,

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.680
or if they're actual state-run intelligence.

02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.040
I can't tell.

02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:16.000
Like this guy, Kaiser Soze, right?

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.000
So he's, he did a very classic move where you,

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:25.680
instead of going right for me, he goes to people around me,

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.160
and then they start talking about,

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.960
and I'm like, oh, who's this guy you're talking about?

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:29.800
Right?

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:30.640
And that's how I get hooked.

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:32.840
And I saw that coming a mile away, right?

02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:34.600
So I was like, okay, I'm here.

02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:35.800
What do you want to say?

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.520
And he won't tell me who's really moving.

02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:40.920
And he goes into this story, it's very specific,

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.600
and it's very good, and I really wish it was true,

02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:44.960
but I don't believe it is.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.480
But I do believe that 60, the 40% of it,

02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:54.160
somewhere over this bridge of the 50% market, is true.

02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.360
It makes sense.

02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:57.720
Trump, there was a meeting in Deutsche Bank,

02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:59.400
he says, when my father was there,

02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:01.000
and he, it's a lie, my father was never there.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.600
I checked his schedule, he did not go to this meeting.

02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:05.800
And Jurgen Fitchison was not there either.

02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:06.960
He claims he was there.

02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:10.160
And two people from Natsutzky were there,

02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:12.040
and he was one of them, right?

02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.520
He says that they came in to buy a silo,

02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:18.600
which is a collateralized loan obligation.

02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:20.920
It's basically a structured product.

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:25.920
It's a, it's a whole shitload of mortgages

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.360
put together into one bundle that you can buy.

02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:31.680
And it's like a bank-to-bank thing.

02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:33.560
You can't, it probably gives no access to it.

02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.520
So they thought they were gonna get rid of this,

02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:38.800
this charge, and sell it to Natsutzky.

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:40.720
And the guy said, well, the problem is,

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:43.360
we don't want you to buy it, we just want you to look at it

02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.040
and tell us what you think.

02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.000
And tell us before you see the problem.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.560
So they looked at it and they saw that,

02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.560
to make this long story short,

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:54.160
Donald Trump did not sign a consenting agreement.

02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:56.600
Okay, so if you have a,

02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:59.800
if you guys are all in a trust, right,

02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:02.040
that means that you're all shared,

02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.440
it's sort of the money that's pooled together.

02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:08.280
Let's say you wanted to borrow $5 million

02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.280
to start a golf course, right?

02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.040
But you don't tell these guys.

02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.800
You take it, you take the $5 million,

02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:14.640
you don't tell them,

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:16.640
and you don't sign a consenting agreement.

02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:20.120
If you fail, they have to pay your debt, right?

02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.880
If you sign a consenting agreement,

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.040
then they're free, right?

02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:26.680
They're not liable for your debt if you fail.

02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:27.520
But you made money,

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.120
you bring it back in and put it in the pool,

02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.640
and everyone's very happy, except that you didn't,

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:35.120
they overlooked the fact that you didn't sign this agreement.

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:37.760
Now, Trump didn't sign three of them, right?

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.400
Which means the people at Deutsche Bank

02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:43.440
and the high net worth individuals at DBTCA specifically

02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:46.080
will be very upset to know that,

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.360
and it would cause them to run on DBTCA.

02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:52.800
Now, and DBTCA has $23 billion going for it,

02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:56.840
and they still don't have a fucking chief risk officer,

02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.480
all right, $23 billion.

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:03.480
That is a 700 person entity, all right?

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:06.920
There's 25,000 Deutsche Bank America,

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.800
700 people in DBTCA.

02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.520
It's very secretive, it's a weird place,

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.080
and that's where my dad,

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:15.120
that's where they put my father when he died,

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.320
when he killed himself.

02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:19.480
There's a French guy that runs it,

02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.040
and he was supposedly at this meeting as well.

02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.360
Now, I'll just, fuck it, I'll just tell you.

02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:31.360
The first guy is Rebolyev, signed off on the loan, okay?

02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:35.280
The second one is, I don't believe him,

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.840
because I fed him the answer, and I fucked up.

02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:40.280
You know when you say, oh, did you hear the word

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:41.760
Victor Bexelberg in the room?

02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:43.520
He goes, oh yeah, that's it, right?

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.320
Fuck, I shouldn't have said that, yeah.

02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:48.200
So he claims Victor Bexelberg was number two,

02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.000
and number three is interesting,

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.040
I didn't believe him until yesterday,

02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:55.280
because something interesting happened yesterday.

02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:59.680
He said that Spare Bank signed on behalf,

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:01.440
a person signed on behalf of Spare Bank,

02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:03.440
not anyone you've heard of, but as,

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.760
sorry, I'm sorry, not Spare Bank, Gazprom.

02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:09.680
Gazprom is an entity signed off on a loan.

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:11.000
I'm like, what the fuck, how can an entity

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:11.840
sign off on a loan?

02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:13.120
I've never heard of that.

02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:16.680
Until yesterday, when this Irish guy I was telling about

02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:20.800
sends me a, they call it charges,

02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:23.720
they call it in Ireland, they call them charges mortgages,

02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:24.560
right?

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:28.200
He sends me this, I have it right here if you wanna see it,

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:34.040
this charge of some land that was sold in Ireland

02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.280
by Deutsche Bank.

02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.680
So Deutsche Bank, as a bank, is an entity liable for it.

02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:40.280
I was like, holy shit, it does,

02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:42.600
and that's very, I've never seen that before.

02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:44.640
And he asked me, I've never seen this before,

02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.040
and I have not answered him yet,

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:48.120
I'm not gonna tell him yes, you know,

02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:50.000
because I don't know who the fuck he's doing,

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.640
where his game is.

02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:54.840
He's telling me that he wants to find a proper journalist,

02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:56.640
he wants Roman Farrell, so I'm like, okay fine,

02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.880
here's Roman Farrell, give him a Roman Farrell,

02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:01.680
but he's still sending me documents, so I don't know.

02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:07.840
And it's, things like that happen a lot, so, yeah.

02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:09.000
So what do you wanna, like, you know,

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.760
economic fraud type stuff, it's good information.

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:14.880
If that's the case too, we'll probably pass it to

02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:17.320
an economic fraud agent, if you can help out too.

02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:19.080
That's right.

02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:21.800
What other, like, are you involved in any hacking groups?

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:25.160
Do you know of any hacking groups that you can get into?

02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:26.400
Like, yeah, a dark net type thing.

02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:31.400
Well, I mean, is this like, what if I say yes, am I in trouble?

02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.840
Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's one group.

02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:37.440
Because obviously the FBI monitors a lot of these things,

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:38.840
and you like to see, you know, what's going on.

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:40.880
Yeah, you guys are in that signal group, aren't you?

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.120
What signal group?

02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:43.760
Which one?

02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:45.680
There's a bunch of signal groups.

02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:48.640
There's one, I know there's some people that we checked,

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:50.320
and there's some like, brand new,

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:53.360
limited identities for some people,

02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.040
we don't know where they came from, so.

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:57.280
I thought it was either FBI, or it was like,

02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:59.480
some spies or something, so I don't know.

02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:02.320
In the signal group, so the signal group,

02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.520
there's the less than you would get?

02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:05.920
Well, it's not, there's a couple of,

02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.680
more than one signal group, so there's a group of people,

02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:10.040
and they're not all hackers, it's like,

02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.000
it's a mix of very interesting people.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.600
Yeah, yeah, it's like, some of the greatest journalists,

02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:17.720
and some of the greatest hackers,

02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:19.280
and some of the greatest activists,

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.160
some of the greatest writers, you know,

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:24.360
and some just fucking fine, interesting people.

02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.800
You know, everyone's having a conversation,

02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.400
but specifically a hacking group, no.

02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.160
But there's like, different variations of these signal groups,

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:33.800
and this one is Barrett, so.

02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:34.920
When he said Houston, I was like,

02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:36.800
oh fuck, he's after Barrett Brown.

02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:40.040
Barrett's on the radar, I mean.

02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:40.880
Yeah?

02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:42.440
Like, but you know that, I mean,

02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.440
he's been arrested already.

02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:48.200
I know, he's in rehab right now, yeah, okay, good side, yeah.

02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:50.080
Well, what's Barrett up to, do you talk to him?

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:51.320
Yeah, I talk to him all the time,

02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:53.600
he pisses me off, he's a little fucking shit,

02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.800
because he's supposed to write great,

02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.800
huge, thunderous story against Val versus David Enridge,

02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.240
but she got too high, and just fucking forgot about it.

02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:06.680
Well, not forgot about it, just didn't do it.

02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:09.000
So, and he hasn't even apologized yet,

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.400
so I'm very pissed off.

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:16.400
And I've got reams and reams of texts with him, so, yeah.

02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:19.440
And he's a good guy, but he doesn't know shit about computers.

02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:20.920
He's not an hacker.

02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:22.800
He's a pharmacist for a good day.

02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:24.840
Yeah, but he's a talker, he's not an hacker.

02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:27.520
No, you barely know how to do that.

02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:30.080
You couldn't find his key chain.

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:31.200
You couldn't do his key chain.

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.040
Seriously, he doesn't know shit.

02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:34.360
That's the funny part about Barrett,

02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:36.680
he doesn't know anything about computers.

02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:37.520
Yeah.

02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:38.520
So, just, like, sort of,

02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:40.280
what part of you have Barrett about?

02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:42.840
No, no, no, he's, you know, just,

02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:45.160
he's kind of like, the reason I have some respect for him

02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:47.800
is because he's sort of, like, on this vengeful path

02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:48.960
that I understand now.

02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.440
I've never been on a vengeful path before,

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:54.000
but now I understand it, I've started it,

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.400
and I know that's what he's doing too.

02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.480
Like, whatever happened with the FBI and him.

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:00.520
But I don't know, I just think it's hilarious

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.360
when he got raided and he was live on the webcam.

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:04.840
I just thought that was funny, I don't know.

02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.640
But then he fucking, I told him,

02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:10.040
I actually recorded this conversation,

02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:12.640
I told him, like, look, dude, where you fucked up

02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:15.520
is where you went after the FBI agent's family.

02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:16.760
That was stupid.

02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:18.880
You must understand how dumb that was.

02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.840
Yes, but, you know, I was already

02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:22.080
gonna be put in jail anyway,

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:25.280
so, come on, bro, you could have avoided a lot of shit

02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:27.400
if you just didn't do that stupid shit.

02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:30.120
So he's an ego that won't,

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.240
that's his biggest issue, his ego.

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:36.240
He can't drop it for a second.

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.240
He doesn't have the humility or the ability to try.

02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:44.320
That's the problem.

02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.880
That's why you can't trust someone like that in here.

02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:49.000
Do you guys part of the top over signal?

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.560
Yeah, yeah.

02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.560
Well, again, I was trying to help him.

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.160
He had no, he's like homeless now,

02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:57.160
with his weird girlfriend, so I was trying to help him.

02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.280
You know, I got him a couple of hotel rooms,

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.120
I sent him some money, he was like, you know,

02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:05.480
and then my girlfriend goes out of her way to,

02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:07.760
sorry, now I'm just complaining, but she goes,

02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:09.600
out of her way to get him a place to live

02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.600
for like a month, so he's off the streets,

02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.640
he doesn't have to worry about food and shit,

02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:15.840
he can just work, because she's like,

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:18.280
do the thing where he fucking promised he promised us,

02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:19.880
like, here's a place to live.

02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.040
And instead of just going there and saying thank you

02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.400
and doing it, he just like,

02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.720
creates this whole chaotic thing of like,

02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.360
well, you didn't tell me to call this day,

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:31.200
and you know, like this minutiae,

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:32.720
so he sabotages the whole thing,

02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:33.640
and then at the end of the month,

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.560
you know what, very, go fuck yourself.

02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.480
I don't, it's not opening anymore,

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.040
the windows closed, it's done.

02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:42.400
And he's like, fuck you, I'm very, you know.

02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.120
No, and I ignore him, the more I ignore him,

02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.080
the more he wants your attention.

02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:47.320
We're seeing it right now,

02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.400
I mean, where in rehab, is it down or?

02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:54.240
Do you really want to know?

02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:55.760
I was just curious, I mean, like.

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.720
You're like, what?

02:28:57.720 --> 02:28:59.000
No, maybe, you don't want to tell,

02:28:59.000 --> 02:28:59.840
you don't have to tell.

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:02.560
No, I, I, I think it's important,

02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:05.600
I think I want to know what and why.

02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.400
Like, if I'm going to take the accountability

02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:08.680
of doing something to somebody here,

02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:10.560
I'm just going to get in trouble if we're in jail,

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.880
I would like to know who it is,

02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:13.880
why I'm doing it and what for it.

02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:14.720
You know what I mean?

02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:16.440
I get it, I mean, I'll tell you this right now,

02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:19.560
I can't tell you everything we do, right?

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.960
Like I said, I'll be honest with you

02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:22.520
as much as you're going to be honest with me.

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.240
I can't tell you the motivation behind

02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:26.120
every single question I ask,

02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.160
because there's a lot of things that the FBI does,

02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:31.400
like if we had an investigation into whatever,

02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:34.480
I don't know, call it Barrett Brown, for example.

02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:36.320
And you want to know why, and it's because,

02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.440
oh, we're going to arrest him tomorrow, right?

02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:40.720
And then you don't say, hey, Barrett, by the way,

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.280
meet you in the FBI, I'm going to fuck you tomorrow.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:43.120
Yeah.

02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:44.960
It probably wouldn't go well for us, right?

02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.240
So that would have to be my choice, right?

02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:48.080
Yeah.

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:51.280
So everything you could tell is totally up to you, right?

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.120
Like I'm not forcing you to give anything,

02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:53.960
you're here on your own.

02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:56.200
Well, I'm not going to give you a Barrett Brown right now.

02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:57.920
If there's something that he's done

02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:00.520
that you feel you want to know,

02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:02.280
or if this is a Vendetta thing,

02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:04.680
then I don't want to be part of the Vendetta.

02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:05.520
Don't worry about that.

02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.680
I mean, I'm trying to assess what information you have,

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:10.360
because whenever he's up there, I'm in Houston, so like.

02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.400
Sure, you know, I've got a Jeremy Hammond,

02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:15.480
Greg House, all the guys, all these people.

02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:17.200
Because like that's the other thing we have to assess too,

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:18.520
is if you're not willing to help.

02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.080
But Greg worked with you, Greg worked with you already.

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:23.200
Greg worked with you guys.

02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:25.240
He's already been helpful, you know.

02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:26.080
Yeah, yeah.

02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:27.760
Like that's the thing is we're collecting

02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:29.760
a lot of information on a lot of different things, right?

02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:30.600
Right.

02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:33.280
So part of it is, it's going to be a one-way street

02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:34.280
of information this way.

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:36.400
I can't give you all the information that's,

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.840
so like if that's what you expect, then, you know,

02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.000
it's no hard feelings, and we part ways, and it's just fun.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.840
Because I can't tell you everything we do, because.

02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:45.680
I know, I don't.

02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:47.320
You don't know me, I don't know you either.

02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:49.160
I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:50.240
I don't.

02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:53.480
No expectations, I just, if it's something that is,

02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:59.800
if I mean, I'm going to be accountable for someone's life,

02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:02.840
I'd really like to think it through, you know.

02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:03.680
Yeah.

02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:06.480
I mean, if you want me to blindly follow orders.

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:08.560
I mean, I will right now,

02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:11.040
because Marla's life is in jeopardy, of course.

02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.600
I'll do whatever the fuck you want to save Marla,

02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:16.080
but at a certain, after that, you know,

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:18.240
I will have to draw a line or something.

02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:19.440
And I, so here's the thing,

02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:21.640
I want you to be as conscious of the decision.

02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:23.200
Let's take Marla's whole way out of the situation.

02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:24.040
Okay.

02:31:24.040 --> 02:31:26.840
And you resolve Marla, everything's both static.

02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:28.800
I want you to make the same decision as her then,

02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:29.680
as you would before that.

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:31.400
Okay, well then, that depends on you.

02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:33.880
If I like you guys, and I believe that this is,

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:36.840
you are like Tim and Jammy, and like you, again,

02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.800
if they told, sent you to me, then I'm trusting them.

02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:42.760
I believe you guys are the good people,

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:45.280
because there are some bad people in the FBI.

02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.160
All right, there's some really fucking shits.

02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.760
In every, not just the FBI, but everywhere.

02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:51.680
And it's hard to find them and negotiate.

02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:53.560
And you know, my read on you right now

02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:56.240
is that you're a very highly intelligent guy.

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.680
You know, but you're hiding something from me right now,

02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.520
and you haven't still,

02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:01.560
you still haven't told me you're hiding something right now.

02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.720
And you are here to suss me out

02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:04.240
from a totally different point of view.

02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:06.320
I'm not sure what point of view that is.

02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:08.600
And you are here to completely give

02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:10.240
the female point of view.

02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:11.440
Oh, wow.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:13.840
I'm joking.

02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:17.760
You have a whole other case that you need help on,

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.320
which is not even related to this,

02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:21.400
but I'm trying to figure out what that is for.

02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:23.840
But you seem more like a New York-style person,

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:25.240
not an LA person.

02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:27.120
So I'm thinking you've got to be,

02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:29.480
you've got to be closer than Tim,

02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:32.040
and you've got to be with Desky and Lyne.

02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:35.480
No, not with Desky and Lyne.

02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:39.920
Anyway, so, but your thing's unrelated to their thing,

02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:40.760
right?

02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:42.440
My clothes?

02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:44.400
Okay.

02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:45.560
You're completely on it, like,

02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:46.880
right before off of those, it is.

02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.520
That's okay, but that's what you tell me,

02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:49.360
and then I,

02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:50.200
So, it's a matter of thinking.

02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:51.280
I'm trying to assess you.

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:52.120
He, he, he, he.

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:52.960
The wrong thing is,

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.080
the people are being straight up.

02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:55.920
Yep.

02:32:55.920 --> 02:32:59.040
I mean, I think underlying related,

02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:00.520
you know, they're wrong,

02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:04.720
and we do this job for the right reasons.

02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:06.200
There are bad apples out there,

02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:09.160
and that's not what you've got across.

02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:10.040
That's right.

02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:15.440
I think the fact that when we listen to you,

02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:17.920
and we ask you questions about model,

02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:19.600
that's not a concern, you know?

02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:22.280
That's not even worse than having a family to report.

02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:24.040
And you've been through that.

02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:25.560
You know, you have a history.

02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:26.400
I have,

02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:28.440
but I have to also question you and think,

02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.440
well, you know, I mean, I could be any way,

02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:31.560
what if I'm the bad guy,

02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:32.760
and I'm sitting here talking to you.

02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:34.760
So do you have to figure out,

02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.600
where am I,

02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:37.440
am I the good person or the bad person, right?

02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:38.640
I told you my side of the story.

02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:40.520
Of course, I'm gonna make myself look good.

02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:42.600
You guys have to do your background on me.

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:44.120
So I figured, have you already done it?

02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:45.280
If I would not be sitting here,

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:46.120
if you hadn't done it,

02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.040
I'd already figured out I was the good guy.

02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:49.800
So I'm gonna have to trust you on that.

02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:50.720
That's what I,

02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:53.760
now I could be jumping to conclusions here,

02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:55.720
but that's why I figured it is happening, right?

02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:57.000
So you're right on that part,

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.560
because I wouldn't bring you in here

02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:01.040
in a situation like this,

02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:02.640
if you were my target, right?

02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:04.560
If you were my target, you were the rest of you.

02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.400
Right, right.

02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.320
That being said,

02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:09.520
we're still trying to figure each other out, right?

02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:10.360
Yeah.

02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:11.680
We need to figure out what our role is,

02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:12.920
and we're trying to figure out

02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:15.000
if you've got any information that can help us.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.400
So, what, oh, databases?

02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.640
Yes, I do have OCCP,

02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:23.080
and I did have all of MLA stuff too,

02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.560
Hunter.Log, actually it's still available,

02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.960
Hunter Archives.

02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.800
Okay.

02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:30.720
And the ICIJ,

02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:31.560
and I've got,

02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:34.720
I don't know, so that's the OCCP and,

02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:36.200
what's Hunter?

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.440
If I could show up for a second,

02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:39.560
I'd have admin access to you.

02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:40.400
This is really good.

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:41.740
I got all the shit that I,

02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:46.740
it was OCCP, yeah, thank you.

02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:51.280
If you want my files,

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.080
you've been helping me up with your admin access.

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.280
I want to sell this shit, you know?

02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:57.120
I can't be stuck looking at half the document.

02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.480
If you want me to find the fucking money laundress,

02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:01.480
you need to see the whole breadth of the thing.

02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:03.360
I have to file the whole paper trail.

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.160
So, that's it.

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.800
So, what do they have on OCCP?

02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:07.640
I've heard about it.

02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.480
So much shit, so much shit.

02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:10.400
Dude, it's great.

02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:12.240
It's great, everything, everything.

02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.080
Every, I mean, all my papers, you know, everything.

02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:18.840
All my shit is there, you know?

02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:20.640
All of MLA stuff is there.

02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:25.000
So, Hunter Archives would be the OSC for MLA stuff.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.720
And then that's what we got.

02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:29.280
It was rated in Germany and one in America or something.

02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:30.120
Which is a shame,

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:31.720
because it was like a public service at Archives.

02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:33.240
It was really good.

02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:38.320
But it's like a, that was her big coup d'etger out there,

02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:41.200
her big tiara on her head sort of thing.

02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.760
What's the word I'm talking about here?

02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:44.600
Her baby or what?

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:45.760
Yeah, whatever it is.

02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:49.880
But it's also, that's like one 20th of the OCCP.

02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.160
Who's at the best of what's the important?

02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:56.160
You know, I don't think she's important.

02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:57.440
Actually, I think she's full of shit.

02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.360
She says, oh, we used to work for the CIA,

02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:01.000
but I can't tell you.

02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:03.440
Like one of those old, you know, isn't that community?

02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:05.280
Did Emma Bester reeling or?

02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.200
I don't know, okay.

02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.280
All I know is that I think she is a,

02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.320
I'm still trying to figure out,

02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:16.280
in that, you know, in any pejorative manner.

02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:19.480
But I think she was a man first,

02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:21.320
and then became a woman, or was she a woman who became a,

02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:22.280
I don't even know that.

02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.920
I just know it's some sort of gender change.

02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.480
And I know that her boyfriend or girlfriend,

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.960
I don't know if she was also a man first,

02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:33.680
but I do know that he slash she is kind of an asshole,

02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:34.640
and that's it.

02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:39.640
It's like the kind of person that asked for money,

02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.480
and then, like, we need money,

02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:44.360
we need help because we have an autistic child.

02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.360
And how do you say no to that?

02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:48.760
You know, but then they sort of say,

02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:52.960
go fuck yourself if you have an idea that they don't have.

02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:53.960
Like in this one group,

02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.960
but a friend of mine was just trying to actually bear it.

02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:00.960
I was like, yeah, you know,

02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.560
what do we do, don't attack this person at this turn,

02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:05.400
that this,

02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:11.120
I'm sort of a lawyer that I can't think of.

02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:13.640
I'm using my speed here,

02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.000
but a nonprofit, some sort of nonprofit,

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.200
don't attack the specific lawyer because he's a good guy.

02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:20.840
And then she says, fuck you, he's a terrible guy.

02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:22.480
You can attack whoever the fuck I want.

02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:27.080
And this is Emma's partner, it stops.

02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:30.520
You know, they're, they heard his or anything?

02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.800
Zen, is there a fake name, X-A-N?

02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:34.640
No, X-A-N.

02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:37.840
Yeah, but I think she's, like,

02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:41.120
it was a whole, it's a dramatically stupid,

02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:43.680
but it's like, but there was this whole drama yesterday

02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:48.680
about she's working in a diner and she got sad

02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:51.760
and she started crying, she couldn't contain her feelings,

02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.120
and it was all melodramatic, and like, so what?

02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:55.960
What are you trying to say?

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.880
If you want money, just say, can I have money?

02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.400
Because we will respect you more

02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:01.040
if you just come out and ask for it.

02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.840
Instead of telling us how sad you are,

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.240
but you have to work in a diner, right?

02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:06.600
If you say, fuck you for saying that,

02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:08.960
and that's the sort of, no, I don't mean it, right?

02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:09.800
You just want it back?

02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:13.080
Yeah, yeah, you know, it's like, it's enough.

02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:14.320
You want money?

02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.800
Yeah, you know, and, yeah, so.

02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:21.160
So is it saying a hacker or is he just doing

02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:25.160
one of these, yeah, to be honest with you, okay.

02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:30.160
I, so I felt like I hacked Deutsche Bank,

02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.640
although I didn't hack Deutsche Bank,

02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:34.120
I felt like I did a pretty good job of hacking it,

02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:36.440
not directly, I didn't go into their servers and do it,

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:38.880
but I fucking hacked that bank.

02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:42.160
And it, well, not maybe in the sense of a hacker,

02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:43.480
you probably, if you're a proper hacker,

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.320
you would not see it.

02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:46.000
But in social engineering and all the people,

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.440
when McKaylee Faisola went to jail,

02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.640
I put the fucking bail, too, all right?

02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:52.600
I got all the data, exposed everything,

02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:53.840
and there's still more to come,

02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.360
which you don't know about, all right?

02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.920
There's a lot more to come, yes.

02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.160
So I, so when Emma's guy, I forgot his name,

02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.160
the Wolfsack, the Spanish guy, hacked the Cayman Islands,

02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:08.240
right?

02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:10.040
That was a great one, by the way, it's good stuff.

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.200
What happened with Cayman?

02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:13.520
I just don't know about it.

02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.800
Well, for me, it was on this, you don't know about it?

02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:16.640
It was here, right?

02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:17.960
Yeah, yeah.

02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:18.960
I missed it, I'm sorry.

02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:19.800
Oh, it's great.

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.640
That's definitely hacking news.

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:23.880
No, I guess this guy was on the service for like a year,

02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:26.200
and it was just, I think he took all the Bitcoin,

02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:27.480
like all of it.

02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:29.880
And so he said, hey, anybody out there hack a bank,

02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:32.400
I'm gonna give you $100,000 of Bitcoin.

02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:33.240
So I'm like, you know what?

02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:34.440
Hey, Emma, could you tell your friend,

02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:36.480
I think I deserve at least a run-in

02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:38.320
for this $100,000 in Bitcoin,

02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:40.080
because although I did not hack Deutsche Bank,

02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.040
that's why I'm trying to work.

02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:43.840
And so Emma's like, no, you didn't,

02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:44.920
you didn't hack Deutsche Bank,

02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:47.720
but she didn't say, oh, let me pass on the message.

02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:49.400
She didn't say, oh, hold on a second,

02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:53.000
she just immediately responded as if she was the hacker.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.760
So I suspected that it's possible that she's the hacker.

02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:58.800
I've always thought she was,

02:39:58.800 --> 02:39:59.960
because I always ask her.

02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:02.600
Like I'm incriminating myself,

02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:04.320
but I'm constantly asking like, Emma,

02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:05.560
can you figure out how to do this?

02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:06.600
Can you hack this shit for me?

02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:08.320
Because I can't get past this point, you know?

02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:11.320
Like with the, for example, David Enrich,

02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.640
we have so much more, oh, this would be something

02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:19.560
maybe you could help me with.

02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:22.120
So many efforts and incriminates him

02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.520
with so many fucking terrible things that he's done

02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:25.920
and all the shit he's done for me.

02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:27.560
It was all in signal.

02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:30.120
And I took my phone to get the screen fix at the Apple Store

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:32.920
and I said, whatever you do, do not reset the phone.

02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:35.680
And the fucking, the hacker has reset the phone.

02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:36.760
And so I lost it all.

02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:38.440
But I think it's an iPhone's success,

02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:40.240
so it's not irretrievable.

02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.400
It's still on the fucking phone.

02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.320
But I cannot get the keys.

02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:45.600
I don't know how to get the fucking keys yet.

02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:48.400
It's been the slowest thing I've ever learned.

02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.960
But I've got the tar ball, I've extracted the messages,

02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:52.560
but I cannot get the fucking encryption keys

02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.320
because I can't find them on the phone.

02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:55.480
That's where I'm stuck.

02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:58.840
It's like, that was, well, Alconov.

02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:01.960
iOS, Frenzik edition.

02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:06.960
iOS, Frenzik, it's just toolkits.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:11.200
iOS, Frenzik, toolkits, it's a quick thing to do.

02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.520
I mean, at least from my experience,

02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:17.320
Alconov isn't like a great novel with Frenzik utility.

02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:20.440
Like, I've played around with it, but I didn't use it because,

02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:22.320
like, they don't automatically decrypt stuff

02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:25.400
because, like, most normal Frenzik's programs do.

02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:26.240
Really?

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:27.560
All right.

02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:29.720
I'll talk to you about the free one.

02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:30.560
Autopsy?

02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:31.400
Is it good?

02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:32.240
Autopsy's not bad.

02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:34.320
I mean, that's a free one that anyone can download, isn't it?

02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:35.560
It's a bunch of other ones that, I think,

02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.360
a better job than Alconov.

02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:38.360
Yeah.

02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:40.400
I just, well, it's because I spent the money.

02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:41.720
You know, it's having expenses,

02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:43.440
so I feel like I have to learn it.

02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:44.280
Yeah.

02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:48.960
I don't know.

02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.920
Another company that kind of delved into mobile,

02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:51.760
it does just my opinion.

02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:53.080
No, no, no, you're right.

02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.280
They're really famous because of the thing with the photographs

02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:58.480
in 2015, right?

02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:00.440
So, like, they're kind of, right in their hotel,

02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:02.280
now they have a mobile Frenzik thing that they're like,

02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:03.760
well, if we put this out and they trust their name,

02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:04.600
then we'll use it.

02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:05.800
But, just from my experience,

02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:07.200
I just haven't had much success with it.

02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.560
Did you try Axiom?

02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:09.400
I used Axiom.

02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:10.240
What do you think of that one?

02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.080
That's not bad.

02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:12.000
It's a lot of good functionality.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.520
Yeah, it's pretty strong.

02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.360
Yeah.

02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:15.520
It's very good.

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:17.640
So then I figured out you can just get pre-trials,

02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:21.840
if you just say you're extending the pre-trials.

02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:24.680
But yeah.

02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:29.680
So you think that Beth is, she actually is a NSA, CIA?

02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.560
No, I think it's worse than full of shit, yeah.

02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:36.040
But do you think that she's a hacker?

02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:36.880
I do.

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.360
I personally, I do think so.

02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.320
I know no one else seems to be sure of my thing,

02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.760
but I do think that she's a hacker.

02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:46.520
I'm always trying to ask her to do it for some help,

02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:50.240
but she's the one that introduced me to Elkheimsoft.

02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:52.800
I said, I have this problem with the signal messages.

02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:53.640
What do you recommend?

02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.480
She said, Elkheimsoft, ILS, forensic.

02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:00.200
What do you mean, Jimmy?

02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:02.040
I don't know.

02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:04.480
Again, again, right, it's too open-ended.

02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:06.400
And she texted me the other day.

02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:09.640
She's like, if you've spoken to FBI,

02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:11.880
I said, no, I'm not speaking to FBI.

02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:14.040
She's like, well, are you sure?

02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:15.280
I was like, well, I'm not lying to you.

02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:17.880
I was talking to the FBI, like, you know,

02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:20.360
I will let you know when I speak to FBI.

02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:24.480
So I go, well, you're kind of known as an FBI informant.

02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:26.280
I said, well, fuck you, I'm not an informant.

02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:28.520
I'm a source, like, help the FBI.

02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:30.680
I do not inform anybody.

02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:32.400
And then she's like, well, it's kind of the same thing.

02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:33.640
And then I had to go on an entire raid

02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.520
to explain how it's very different.

02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:38.640
So we'll let you know that she is probably,

02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:42.320
and also yesterday, one of my friends, Andrew,

02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:44.280
had to defend me on this group as well,

02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:47.480
because Xan was saying, your friend

02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:50.280
with a well-known FBI informant, which is me,

02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:52.080
which is another illusion to me.

02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.240
So it's Xan.

02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:56.480
Oh, Xan is telling you.

02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:58.800
Xan's the partner of Emma.

02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.720
So she's saying to who that you're a friend of mine

02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:03.600
in our group.

02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:06.840
Oh, so your friend is, Xan is acting your friend

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:07.880
for being friends with you?

02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:08.880
Yes.

02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:09.380
Oh, OK.

02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:09.880
Sorry.

02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:12.360
Exactly.

02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:13.360
OK.

02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.920
I mean, it's obviously a little different,

02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:18.080
and I don't know if you understand.

02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:19.080
This is weird drama.

02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:23.080
It's like, yeah, there are many people with a group like that.

02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:25.560
I think this, you know, I'm like 96, I think.

02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:26.800
Oh, wow.

02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:29.080
That's why it's too many people.

02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:31.160
And there's too many lurkers, and there's too many new

02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.960
and fresh, like, mid-dag identity,

02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:36.040
so there's already a bunch of substratas,

02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:38.720
and some groups are coming from that group.

02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:42.240
And what's funny is they're all, well, I mean,

02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:43.480
I'll tell you, it's not a big deal.

02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.240
It's with all Barrett's friends.

02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:48.520
Barrett's so, like, it's so weird.

02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:51.400
I don't know how he does it, but he's, you know.

02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:54.760
Because you might, of the 96, you might know how many people

02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:56.680
in real life are in that group.

02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:58.440
Like, women in real life.

02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:01.040
Well, I guess, like, who they really are.

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:02.880
Oh, I know about half of them.

02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:03.380
Yeah.

02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:05.800
Like, into the other half, or like, lurker or something.

02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:10.480
Yeah, but we have people that try and check them out

02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:12.840
and figure out who these people are.

02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:14.560
Like, once in a while, you'll get it right,

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.880
and we can serve it, you know, coming in there

02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:20.680
and trying to spout a bunch of crazy shit, and kick him out.

02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:23.040
And then, I noticed, someone loses a phone.

02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:24.720
Like, it happened recently, and then all of a sudden,

02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.160
we have to, it's been compromised, the FBI's in.

02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.880
I'm sure you, was that you?

02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.520
I don't know.

02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:31.960
Was it you?

02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:32.680
Okay, somebody.

02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:33.680
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:35.560
I don't know, somebody.

02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:41.680
Oh, and that, oh, shit, wait, I'm Junco.

02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:43.160
Did you call Barrett?

02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:45.640
I think he recorded a phone call with you.

02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:46.480
I hadn't called Barrett.

02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:47.320
You hadn't called Barrett?

02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:52.560
There was a different FBI agent that was trying to,

02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:57.240
he was going to, I think it was some white racist,

02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.560
nationalist fucking weird shit.

02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.280
And he was someone else who was working, white racist.

02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:05.160
Yeah, he used to know, but I remember the name

02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:07.240
of Junco actually rings a bell.

02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:09.200
And I was, I was going to tell you the other day,

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.760
but I had to figure out what it was first.

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:12.240
But now I just remembered again, I probably

02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:14.760
should not be talking right now and saying it out loud,

02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:17.420
but I am.

02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:23.080
But there is something, there is something,

02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:24.880
something secret.

02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:25.760
Secret is going to be right now.

02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:26.640
Okay?

02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:28.840
You don't know who the person is.

02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:29.800
Were you there?

02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:30.960
He's only, he's the one who realized?

02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:32.080
No.

02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:32.880
Does he know Barrett?

02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:34.400
Have you got him in question?

02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:37.000
I know, I know, I've never met a person.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.360
Oh, well, I mean, I have met, yes,

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.320
there's a few people I know first,

02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:44.400
but I can't, like my friends, I'm not gonna tell you, yeah.

02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:48.480
Getting a sense of the group, like, any other.

02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:50.760
Let me show you, like, the most recent thing.

02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:53.440
Let's see.

02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:01.440
Ooh, someone's trying to,

02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:05.680
Hey, you guys, who's trying to hack me now?

02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:06.520
You got a thing?

02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:07.360
No.

02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:08.320
Don't click on the link.

02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:09.920
What was it? What did you get?

02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:11.200
No, I just got one of these things.

02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:12.880
I think it's my girlfriend.

02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:15.120
Who's using the other computer?

02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:16.160
Oh, he's.

02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.440
No, that's not what that says.

02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:18.280
That's my girlfriend.

02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:19.880
He's finding it really fucking awesome.

02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:21.000
Yeah, I know.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.440
It's, like, it's funny enough, the other computer

02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.520
is Gwen Simpson's.

02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:27.600
What was that?

02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:29.600
Yeah, it was the Fusion GCat.

02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:31.800
The Steal Dacian.

02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:36.320
I mean, like, there's a lot of stuff

02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:37.160
that I probably shouldn't know,

02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:39.800
but I just don't, I mean, it's kind of like.

02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.320
You didn't follow the Steal Dacian?

02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:42.320
The whole Trump Russia?

02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:43.160
No, I didn't know about it,

02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:44.760
but, like, I didn't follow that much.

02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:46.800
Anyway, I said, I lived at his house for a while,

02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:48.400
at Gwen's house, yeah.

02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:49.560
And he didn't pay me half the money

02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:51.560
he was supposed to, so I took the computer.

02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:53.600
Wait, is that, yeah.

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.800
Oh, and yeah, and there's a whole Russian spy thing

02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:01.120
going on, too.

02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:02.440
What's the Russian spy thing?

02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.000
So there's, so I was telling Tim and Jami as well,

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.840
but they're sort of, they're things, so I don't know.

02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.360
Am I supposed to mix things together?

02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.120
But if Tim's aware of it, like, I would use the hot tin.

02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:17.120
Let me tell Tim first.

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:17.960
Let me tell Tim first.

02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:18.800
Okay.

02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:20.560
Well, I should ask him if it's okay

02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.400
Yeah, I mean, if Tim already knows about it,

02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:25.960
he would, like, I don't worry that type of stuff either,

02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:28.160
so, like, I would just tell someone else to.

02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:31.160
Yeah, would he, would he tell me the, uh,

02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:33.200
interior or the exterior?

02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.160
Like, like, what, the United States

02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:36.840
or outside of the United States?

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:39.160
Are we looking for a Russian hacker

02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:41.560
or are we looking for a, everything?

02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:42.400
Yeah?

02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:44.640
Dude, that would be fun for me.

02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:45.680
I would like to catch people.

02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:47.840
I like, I can, I can do that.

02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:49.840
But if money, the money is my specialty.

02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:52.920
That's what I'm, better than the hacker.

02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:57.520
Cool.

02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:58.360
All right.

02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.760
Do you need to send someone for something?

02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:02.000
Oh, yeah, sorry.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.600
No, I just got, I need to eat something.

02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.440
My brain is...

02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:06.720
You don't think you're gonna eat something?

02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.160
Yeah, could we take a cigarette break or something?

02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:10.120
Is it okay?

02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:10.960
Yeah.

02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:11.800
Yeah?

02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:14.640
All right, let's do it.

02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:16.480
What do you want?

02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:17.760
No, no, no, I just...

02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:19.280
Yeah, I want sandwiches, then.

02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:20.120
Really?

02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:20.960
Yeah.

02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:21.800
What kind of sandwich?

02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:23.320
A sandwich or...

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.160
Okay.

02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:26.160
Sure, well, yeah, I'd love one.

02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:29.360
Gratsen, that's nice.

02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:31.520
I'll put on a mask or whatever.

02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:33.240
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:36.920
What was I gonna show you?

02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:39.600
At the time, you're...

02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:44.560
Look, I don't know allegiance to these guys at all.

02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:47.520
I mean, they've just, they've become sort of friends, but,

02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:51.600
you know, as much as you can have a friend on that,

02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:56.840
that doesn't tell you anything about that, right?

02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:59.520
It's just sort of fun, more fun sort of.

02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:03.120
Like, you're in the workplace,

02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:05.840
you're not friends with all your workers, right?

02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:07.160
No, I don't feel right for now.

02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:11.480
Oh, yeah, I'll hit the head, you know where it is, right?

02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:12.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:13.320
You guys are just gonna go...

02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:14.800
But I'll wait for you, because you can't fit out.

02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:15.640
Oh, that's right.

02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:22.600
So what's your specialty?

02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:24.720
No, same, but I just happened to work in this office.

02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:25.560
In this office?

02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:27.920
Right, so, if you say, like, laundry.

02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:28.760
Yeah?

02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.640
Of course, he, you know, he flew here to speak to you,

02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.200
so let him, let him, yeah, yeah, he flew here yesterday.

02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:37.120
I didn't know it was just for me,

02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120
I just thought he was coming here

02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.240
and I wanted to speak to you while he was here.

02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.920
Yeah, so, for me, like, when you're in management,

02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:45.840
I'm like, oh, okay, like, a lot of these guys on the floor

02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:48.560
do, like, business email compromise, and a lot of guys,

02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:49.400
like...

02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:50.240
Did you, what?

02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.240
I didn't hear you.

02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.480
Business email compromise?

02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:53.320
Oh, really?

02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:54.840
Yeah, I don't know, okay.

02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:55.960
That's easy, yeah.

02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:59.120
Yeah, so, business email compromise, and then...

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:00.080
Is that a term for it?

02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:01.280
Just business email compromise?

02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:02.440
There's a, I didn't know there was a term for it.

02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:03.880
Yeah, so a lot of things out of Nigeria,

02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:05.200
and it's just funny, when you mentioned

02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:07.280
you're not lobbying, is there a thing like...

02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:09.720
Yeah, one of our guys over here,

02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:13.120
they just got someone out of, like, Dubai,

02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:14.080
or something like that.

02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:14.920
Yeah, okay.

02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:15.880
Cool.

02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:19.200
And they're digging into that versus something like,

02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:21.520
they're special to you, like, laundering,

02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:22.600
laundering money, right?

02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:25.480
So, like, romance, victim, romance scam victims,

02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:26.560
like a victimized...

02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.480
Oh, yeah, I heard that.

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:31.520
Eventually, he gets out to, like, Canada, China,

02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:32.640
or all these other countries,

02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:34.840
and there's, like, a whole money mule network

02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:36.240
that's, like, pretty tough to...

02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.080
Is it really?

02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:37.920
Is it like a company?

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.080
Is it one person behind it, or is it...

02:51:39.080 --> 02:51:41.520
No, no, no, it's all a loose connection, yeah.

02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:42.360
Loose.

02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:43.200
Interesting.

02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:46.800
It's like a, like, a lead in welding connections

02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:50.960
sort of thing, like, there was a...

02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:52.960
Basically, like, very, very...

02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:54.200
And they all know each other in person,

02:51:54.200 --> 02:51:55.040
that's the difference.

02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:55.880
Oh, they do?

02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:56.720
They know each other, it's like,

02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:57.560
oh, you know this guy?

02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:00.040
He's leading, interested in, you know,

02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:03.080
doing some work, opening bank accounts, and stuff like that.

02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:04.640
Ah, I understand that, yeah.

02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:07.440
So, like, they're friends in Nigeria?

02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:09.440
Or in the community?

02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.440
Shit, you know we did?

02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:14.400
We had to, like, this lawyer was essentially an asshole.

02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:18.040
He said, we need your narrative to store ACP for Monday.

02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:21.120
So, I went on the Fiverr, and I tried to find it.

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:21.960
Oh, Fiverr.

02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:24.120
It's a narrative of Marie's story.

02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:25.320
Fiverr.

02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:26.800
So, I went on Fiverr?

02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:27.640
Oh, sure.

02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:31.080
I went on Fiverr.

02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:31.920
Really?

02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:35.320
I found someone to do a live transcription

02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:36.800
and it's a Nigerian guy.

02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:40.120
He wanted to be paid in Bitcoin yesterday or tomorrow.

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:42.960
And Marie says, no, I'm not gonna pay you that.

02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:45.440
And then he says, okay, and that's it.

02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:50.440
So, I'm thinking, well, he just got all of Marie's

02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:52.440
information since she was a child.

02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:55.440
So, he should probably pay the guy, right?

02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:57.280
It's a new scam, I think.

02:52:57.280 --> 02:52:58.560
You're doing transcription services,

02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:01.360
get your private data, and then sell that data.

02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:02.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:04.480
Nigerian's committing fraud.

02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:05.320
What do you mean?

02:53:07.320 --> 02:53:10.080
Like crazy, you know, connoisseurs, yes.

02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:13.920
I mean, they're in that rush, they're doing good stuff.

02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:17.800
Why isn't that, why is that the hotbed here,

02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:19.320
criminal activity?

02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:22.240
I don't know, it's what's called like training, you know?

02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:23.080
Training stuff.

02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:23.920
You're gonna wait here real quick?

02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:24.760
Okay.

02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:28.320
You think they train each other and like,

02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:29.960
you know, it's like, hey, you know,

02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:31.640
you grow up with all these people and like,

02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:33.840
hey, you want to make a cash and then they say,

02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:35.840
all you gotta do is you send out these emails,

02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:37.640
there's this script and whatever,

02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:39.080
and then they teach other people.

02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:42.720
It's like any other criminal organization.

02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:44.240
That's the way it works, it's all good.

02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:46.000
Right now, I guess they're,

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.120
I haven't been looking around right here,

02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:48.880
but they're like in protest right now?

02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:49.720
Oh, really?

02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:52.200
I don't see anything, so Pat's gonna cut it off.

02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:53.040
I'm gonna say there's no, like,

02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:54.800
see any signers or whatever.

02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:56.440
Yeah, that'd be bad.

02:53:56.440 --> 02:53:57.280
Yeah, exactly.

02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:58.280
Yeah, I don't know why that.

02:53:58.280 --> 02:53:59.120
Yeah.

02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:02.640
Huh.

02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:03.840
Where are they protesting?

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:06.440
There's the answer, you know?

02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:09.800
Don't join, pal.

02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:11.320
Don't do it, don't do it.

02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:14.800
You guys get a bad rap, you know?

02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:16.760
Like seriously, I was like everybody else

02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:18.520
until I met Tim and Jenny.

02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:19.360
Yeah.

02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.200
And then I was like, you know,

02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.040
I can't believe I considered you guys people, guys.

02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:25.120
What are you doing here, dude?

02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:27.760
You just being careful on me, yeah.

02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.680
How'd you guys get started on this?

02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:31.920
I don't know, I just started a little while ago.

02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:33.440
I always wanted to do it as a kid.

02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:34.280
Yeah?

02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:35.520
Here I am, so I'm talking to Dad.

02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:36.840
Did you good do the whole training

02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:38.840
and either you taught you everything now

02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:40.000
or did you know before?

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Not much, not much.

02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.360
Oh, for the computer stuff I went to,

02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:45.880
my degree is in there.

02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:46.720
Oh, it is?

02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:47.560
I don't know about that.

02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.960
I'm like, oh no, but yeah,

02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:51.200
fan thing is I want to do it as a kid

02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:54.600
and then easily enough, you just apply online, everything.

02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:55.640
Yeah.

02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:58.400
Yeah, so it's not like you know a guy or whatever.

02:54:58.400 --> 02:54:59.760
No, that's cool, that's cool.

02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:00.600
Interesting.

02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:01.440
How lucky.

02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:03.000
That's good.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:03.960
Yeah, I'll give you a quick peep.

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:06.080
This is what it's like, you can scroll around.

02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:08.720
It's not that, it's not a cool, great, crazy day

02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:11.080
that I keep, it's not what you think.

02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:11.920
Cool.

02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:23.000
I'm not for rockin'.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:23.840
What's wrong?

02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:25.560
I'm not for rockin', it's business.

02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:27.600
I assume these are not like real people, right?

02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:28.920
No, they're not real people.

02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:31.480
I mean, they're not their real names.

02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:34.480
Some of them, I mean, I use my real name.

02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:35.480
That's your friend.

02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:36.760
I use his real name.

02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:37.600
Oh.

02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:39.360
I think Barry uses his real name.

02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:42.240
Conlon, I don't know, kind of, Doc Rockett is a,

02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:44.840
I can't remember, I used to read through it again.

02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:46.240
I used to know what everybody was, but.

02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:47.920
He's too many secrets, you know?

02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:50.080
Oh, that guy's great, yeah, I do.

02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:51.760
Let me tell them.

02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:53.880
He doesn't do anything illegal.

02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:56.240
He's like, he's just like a researcher.

02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:57.640
He's not even that good.

02:55:57.640 --> 02:55:59.360
He's got a couple of databases in there.

02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:01.240
He's just very loyal and helpful.

02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:02.360
It's a little, yeah.

02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:03.880
So if anyone needs my help, I'll do that.

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.520
Kind of nice thing.

02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.920
So there are no film crews outside,

02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:08.760
but you never know.

02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:11.640
They could show up to your comfort level.

02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:12.480
Okay, let's go.

02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:15.160
At the same time, the protest is like

02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:17.920
about salons wanting to open.

02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:19.040
That's what, salons?

02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:20.240
Yeah, like salons.

02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:21.560
Okay.

02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:22.400
Cool.

02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:23.240
Let's join.

02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:24.240
A bit of a carry.

02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:26.440
Oh, that's what we really did there.

02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:27.760
Oh, thank you.

02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:30.040
That was pretty good, though.

02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:31.560
I mean, I give you credit.

02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:38.080
God, it's split ends.

02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:39.400
Okay, there you go.

02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.440
So yeah, it's not that it's fun.

02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:46.920
It's mostly just people yelling.

02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:49.040
During like, you know, Joe,

02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:50.520
I'm sure you know Joe Fiona.

02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:53.080
Who's Joe Fiona?

02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:55.040
Joe is like, what's his name?

02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:56.440
Sub-Zero?

02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:57.360
Sub-Zero?

02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:58.200
What's his name?

02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:00.040
I think in 2000.

02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:01.520
I'm talking about the moral product character.

02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:02.360
I don't know.

02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:03.200
I don't know.

02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:04.040
It's his name.

02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:04.880
He's alias.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:07.480
He's pretty, he's a clever guy.

02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:08.520
He was in the,

02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:09.720
did you see the Hacker War film?

02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:12.040
That's the film that women did with Barrett.

02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:16.720
It's basically the guy that's talking all the time.

02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:18.920
And wearing a suit, that guy.

02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.000
Okay.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.040
Joe, is he a hacker?

02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:24.920
I think, yeah, he's like a, yeah.

02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:25.880
Okay.

02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:27.520
So he's like, he's friends with Barrett.

02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:28.920
Is that how he got in the group?

02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:31.320
Yeah, these old friends of Barrett.

02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:32.160
Cool.

02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:35.240
He's one of his old friends of Barrett, man.

02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:36.960
So what did Joe do?

02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.280
Joe, I'm not quite sure.

02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.360
I think he goes cycling a lot.

02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:43.880
He spends most of his time cycling

02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:44.720
during the year.

02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:47.600
He's a, everyone,

02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:49.880
but these guys are fairly optimistic, you know,

02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:52.200
based, which is great and all.

02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:54.880
I'm not really a, you know,

02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:57.320
I mean, I guess I don't believe anything that strongly

02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:59.080
to go out and carry a sign.

02:57:59.080 --> 02:57:59.920
Sure.

02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:01.880
But I'm sure, you know,

02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:06.600
I mean, if someone DCFS right now,

02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:08.520
of course, I think I would probably carry a sign.

02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:11.000
So I'm like, it hasn't hit me personally yet.

02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:14.960
I mean, that's a really popular corner.

02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:15.800
Yeah, wow.

02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:17.040
Just because it's like one of the,

02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:17.880
you hear it over there.

02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:19.200
Yeah, this would be okay.

02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:21.960
It's really far away.

02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:32.920
I can push a little bit over there.

02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:33.760
Sure.

02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:36.600
Oh, really?

02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:37.440
Oh, man.

02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:42.400
So, yeah, I mean, just like everyone,

02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:43.520
the people who use their real names

02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:46.080
really aren't afraid of the guy finding out.

02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:48.120
So, I'm sure you, yeah.

02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:53.600
But the, yeah, there was another interesting thing.

02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:56.880
God, I can't remember why they say code.

02:58:57.160 --> 02:58:59.000
I'm running to show you the thing.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:00.320
I can almost guarantee you.

02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:02.840
It's not me, because I'm not that important.

02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:04.800
No, but you were from Houston,

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:06.800
and Barrett said it was a guy from Houston

02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:08.680
that called a friend of his

02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:10.720
that was trying to infiltrate some group,

02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:12.040
but he was on the wrong group.

02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:14.040
I don't know exactly what happened.

02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:15.200
We got a recording of the phone call.

02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:16.520
I wanted to play back the phone call

02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:18.640
to see if that was you talking to this other guy.

02:59:18.640 --> 02:59:20.240
Not Barrett directly, but someone else.

02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:22.040
I would be interested if you got a recording

02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:23.400
of me talking to someone.

02:59:23.400 --> 02:59:24.240
I love you.

02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:25.080
I love you.

02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:29.280
Yeah, that's what I said with the code.

02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:32.880
Okay.

02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:40.640
Now, could you, is it possible that,

02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:46.640
is it possible to have this guy,

02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:48.080
that you've done your research,

02:59:48.080 --> 02:59:50.560
you probably understand that Steve is not a good guy?

02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:51.400
He's Steve.

02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:52.240
Steve Tolts?

02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:55.080
You've posted here on Facebook.

02:59:55.080 --> 02:59:58.880
Yeah, like he's not a stand-up guy.

02:59:58.880 --> 02:59:59.720
He's not a,

03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:04.960
you know the type that's run to mom and the scribbling.

03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:05.960
Yeah, not yet.

03:00:08.480 --> 03:00:11.360
I think it's actually really become a threat

03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:15.320
to not only tomorrow's update with the priest,

03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:16.480
the priest that's happening.

03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:17.480
Sure, no, I get it.

03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:21.240
Is it possible to have him reported?

03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:23.080
No.

03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:27.520
Australia.

03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:34.680
I went to a whole moral crisis.

03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:36.920
Did I do this or not?

03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:39.400
And I asked them, they said they'd do it.

03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:40.240
But then I said,

03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:41.520
but then all of a sudden I had this father,

03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:43.080
I said, we're not going to do that tomorrow.

03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:44.840
That was the bottom line.

03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:46.000
But that was last year.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Yeah, that was last year.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.080
But now everyone's really asking me,

03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:51.040
I know.

03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:53.360
Thank you.

03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:54.360
Thank you.

03:00:54.360 --> 03:00:56.360
Oh, good, good, good, good.

03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:01.720
You're welcome.

03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:02.720
I am the broker.

03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:04.160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:06.200
You actually thought about it.

03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:08.640
I was like, I'm not fucking one out.

03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:09.920
I was like, you know,

03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:12.040
don't look at me, I did it on the right.

03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:13.440
I did, I did it on the right.

03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:14.440
That's all I got.

03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:17.440
It's a little bit economic.

03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:20.440
Because I was shopping in one town,

03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:23.440
and this was like twice that.

03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:25.440
I'm like, if you guys really eat it,

03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:26.440
I can eat for a week.

03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:27.440
That's true.

03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:36.440
I don't think you guys realize how nice this weather is

03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:38.440
for August, whatever.

03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:40.440
Do you know Andrews?

03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:41.440
I don't like this weather.

03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:43.440
Do you know Andrews?

03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:44.440
Who's Andrew?

03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:46.440
The one you pointed out, my friend.

03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:47.440
Your friend?

03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:48.440
Yeah.

03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:49.440
I mean, you just told me about him,

03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:50.440
but I don't know.

03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:52.440
Before I mentioned him.

03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:54.440
He's a good, interesting character.

03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:55.440
What's the deal?

03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:56.440
He's a really good guy.

03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:57.440
Good dude.

03:01:58.440 --> 03:01:59.440
Do you remember, maybe,

03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:03.440
probably in 2015 there was this article

03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:06.440
in Bloomberg about

03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:08.440
if there was this company,

03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:09.440
and it turned out later,

03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:11.440
you find out articles later,

03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:14.440
that it was a Russian company,

03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:16.440
they created this big deficit for people.

03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:17.440
Someone would call you and say,

03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:19.440
you owe us $2,000 a month,

03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:21.440
and then you say,

03:02:21.440 --> 03:02:22.440
you got this thing,

03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:23.440
you forgot about it,

03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:24.440
you should probably pay it.

03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:26.440
Most people will pay that money.

03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:29.440
If you will just create this big debt,

03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:31.440
and it's a really fucking dollar,

03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:33.440
and it's $1,000,000 a month.

03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:35.440
So a lot of people would take the manager,

03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:36.440
and people would just be doing that.

03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:38.440
And they'd try to get it to Andrews.

03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:39.440
They wouldn't call Andrew,

03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:41.440
and they'd say, you owe us $5,000,

03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:42.440
we're a combination of debts,

03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:43.440
and they'd say,

03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:44.440
oh my god,

03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:45.440
I remember paying that back,

03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:47.440
they didn't really owe us.

03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:49.440
So he starts fighting and arguing with this guy,

03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:51.440
until the guy threatens to go

03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:53.440
and create this company.

03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:54.440
Like, totally possible,

03:02:54.440 --> 03:02:55.440
and Andrew said,

03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:56.440
that's it.

03:02:56.440 --> 03:02:58.440
So he starts doing like,

03:02:58.440 --> 03:02:59.440
he's now,

03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:02.440
he's the Liam Neeson thing,

03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:04.440
I have three,

03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:05.440
you know,

03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:07.440
a few good things,

03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:08.440
whatever the client is.

03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:09.440
And that's pretty good.

03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:10.440
So you reverse engineers,

03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:11.440
it's brilliant what he did,

03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:12.440
I love it.

03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:13.440
Reverse engineers,

03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:14.440
everyone that's called him,

03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:15.440
and looks him up,

03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:16.440
there's all the background on them,

03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:19.440
gets them to give up more information on their,

03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:21.440
just like you could do in any case.

03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:22.440
You know,

03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:23.440
give information to the guy at mob,

03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:24.440
and the hierarchy,

03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:26.440
all the way up to Weldon,

03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:27.440
the congressman,

03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:29.440
was he a senator or congressman?

03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:31.440
Well, I'm a senator or something.

03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:32.440
Is he Weldon?

03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:33.440
No,

03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:34.440
Josh Weldon,

03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:36.440
or is he something Weldon?

03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:37.440
Yeah, man,

03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:38.440
I don't know all the senators

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.440
who represented him,

03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:40.440
so I'm a bad,

03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:41.440
he's an ex-servant.

03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:42.440
But,

03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:43.440
I mean,

03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:44.440
he might be,

03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:45.440
he might be actually,

03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:46.440
I know he's a congressman person,

03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:47.440
but that's about the ex-servant,

03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:48.440
I know.

03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:49.440
Yeah,

03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:50.440
but he's in bed with a lot of,

03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:51.440
the Russian companies,

03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:53.440
they're creating these fake debt companies,

03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:55.440
and it's a really good story,

03:03:55.440 --> 03:03:56.440
it's great articles,

03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:57.440
and it's just sort of reverse engineers,

03:03:57.440 --> 03:03:58.440
put some in jail,

03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:00.440
and it's a good guy at the store.

03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:01.440
It's very impressed.

03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:02.440
That's cool.

03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:03.440
I mean,

03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:04.440
he found me,

03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:05.440
he just wanted to know

03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:06.440
if I had any data

03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:07.440
on those people as well,

03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.440
like,

03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:09.440
I was looking for Weldon,

03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:10.440
the Russians,

03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:11.440
the Tudmento,

03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:13.440
or some other guy,

03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:15.440
and that's how we became friends.

03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:16.440
He's a good guy.

03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:17.440
That's cool.

03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:19.440
I thought he was already working with you guys.

03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:20.440
I'm pretty sure he was,

03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:21.440
I thought he was CIA.

03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:22.440
Okay,

03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:23.440
I mean,

03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:24.440
so if he was CIA then,

03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:25.440
I don't think he would.

03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:26.440
That's what I thought.

03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:27.440
I don't know.

03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:28.440
Have you ever been in the,

03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:29.440
like,

03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:30.440
okay.

03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:31.440
Yeah,

03:04:31.440 --> 03:04:32.440
he came out to visit.

03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:33.440
I don't know,

03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:35.440
do you think he'd want to work with us?

03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:36.440
I think he would.

03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:37.440
I think he would,

03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:38.440
actually.

03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:40.440
Do you want to give me his contact information?

03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:42.440
I think I'd have to ask him.

03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:43.440
Okay.

03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:44.440
And then,

03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:45.440
if he'd never have to,

03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:46.440
I'd bring it up.

03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:47.440
Because I don't know,

03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:48.440
he's like a,

03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:49.440
like a really,

03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:52.440
he almost pisses me off,

03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:53.440
he's like,

03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:54.440
too good.

03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:55.440
He's like,

03:04:55.440 --> 03:04:57.440
he reminds me of my father in the sense

03:04:57.440 --> 03:04:58.440
of his morality.

03:04:58.440 --> 03:04:59.440
He's very,

03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:00.440
very strong.

03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:01.440
That's good.

03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:02.440
So that's the thing you guys like,

03:05:02.440 --> 03:05:03.440
I mean,

03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:04.440
you hire a lot of,

03:05:04.440 --> 03:05:05.440
like,

03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:06.440
Mormons, right?

03:05:06.440 --> 03:05:07.440
So,

03:05:07.440 --> 03:05:08.440
who's at the CIA?

03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:10.440
Who's hiring all the Mormons?

03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:12.440
They're doing a lot of good things.

03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:13.440
Yeah, okay.

03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:14.440
If they can pass the broadcast,

03:05:14.440 --> 03:05:15.440
yeah.

03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:16.440
Okay,

03:05:16.440 --> 03:05:17.440
really the Mormons

03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:18.440
can't pass the broadcast?

03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:19.440
That's great.

03:05:19.440 --> 03:05:20.440
Because they can't.

03:05:20.440 --> 03:05:21.440
They cannot.

03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:22.440
No, they can't.

03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:23.440
Oh, they can't,

03:05:23.440 --> 03:05:24.440
right?

03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:25.440
Yeah.

03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:26.440
Okay,

03:05:26.440 --> 03:05:27.440
okay.

03:05:27.440 --> 03:05:28.440
I mean,

03:05:28.440 --> 03:05:29.440
the Mormons

03:05:29.440 --> 03:05:30.440
a lot of time,

03:05:30.440 --> 03:05:31.440
they do missions.

03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:32.440
So when they go overseas,

03:05:32.440 --> 03:05:33.440
they learn the language,

03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:34.440
it's probably useful

03:05:34.440 --> 03:05:35.440
for like,

03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:36.440
CIA and all that kind of stuff.

03:05:36.440 --> 03:05:37.440
Right,

03:05:37.440 --> 03:05:38.440
good cover.

03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:39.440
Yeah.

03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:40.440
Yeah,

03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:41.440
but it's so,

03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:42.440
like,

03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:43.440
we're so

03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:44.440
strict with rules

03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:45.440
and stuff.

03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:46.440
How do you,

03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:47.440
how do you,

03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:48.440
justify one thing

03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:49.440
or do something else?

03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:50.440
That's a good question.

03:05:50.440 --> 03:05:51.440
That's something

03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:52.440
I've,

03:05:52.440 --> 03:05:53.440
know nothing about.

03:05:53.440 --> 03:05:54.440
Right.

03:05:54.440 --> 03:05:55.440
Well,

03:05:55.440 --> 03:05:56.440
being a Mormon

03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:57.440
won't work for the agency.

03:05:57.440 --> 03:05:58.440
Like,

03:05:58.440 --> 03:05:59.440
how do you justify,

03:05:59.440 --> 03:06:00.440
like,

03:06:00.440 --> 03:06:01.440
a man,

03:06:01.440 --> 03:06:02.440
a woman,

03:06:02.440 --> 03:06:03.440
a man,

03:06:03.440 --> 03:06:04.440
a man,

03:06:04.440 --> 03:06:05.440
a man,

03:06:05.440 --> 03:06:06.440
a man,

03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:07.440
a man,

03:06:07.440 --> 03:06:08.440
a man,

03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:09.440
a man,

03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:10.440
a man,

03:06:10.440 --> 03:06:11.440
a man,

03:06:11.440 --> 03:06:12.440
a man,

03:06:12.440 --> 03:06:13.440
a man.

03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:14.440
What do you guys

03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:15.440
do?

03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:16.440
Jesus,

03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:17.440
people?

03:06:17.440 --> 03:06:18.440
Can't see that.

03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:19.440
Okay.

03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:20.440
Do it or not do it?

03:06:20.440 --> 03:06:21.440
No.

03:06:21.440 --> 03:06:22.440
I wish there was.

03:06:22.440 --> 03:06:23.440
Yeah,

03:06:23.440 --> 03:06:24.440
I wish there was.

03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:25.440
Yeah,

03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:26.440
I wish there was.

03:06:26.440 --> 03:06:27.440
Yeah,

03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:28.440
I wish there was.

03:06:28.440 --> 03:06:34.440
That's what's more impressive, what you need for me right away is the thing that you have on your plate.

03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:40.440
What I can help you with, what you can do with the transactional for M's safety.

03:06:40.440 --> 03:06:44.440
I would like to bro it, Steve.

03:06:44.440 --> 03:06:46.440
Listen to me, sir.

03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:48.440
Thank you.

03:06:54.440 --> 03:06:56.440
Seriously, it caught me up.

03:06:56.440 --> 03:06:58.440
Are you happy?

03:06:58.440 --> 03:07:00.440
Maybe.

03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:02.440
You've got to take off that pavilion.

03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:04.440
Thank you.

03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:06.440
Thank you very much.

03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:08.440
You're welcome.

03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:10.440
I like the economy with our mayor.

03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:12.440
That's right.

03:07:12.440 --> 03:07:16.440
I'm going to watch out for the mayor.

03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:34.440
I would have to be really secretive if I now tell the mayor.

03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:36.440
I can't tell her everything.

03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:40.440
What I don't tell her, she always finds out.

03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:42.440
What would you tell her?

03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:48.440
I'm going to tell her, oh they offered me a job.

03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:52.440
I'd be like, what are they paying down?

03:07:52.440 --> 03:07:54.440
Not money.

03:07:54.440 --> 03:07:56.440
It's a good job.

03:07:56.440 --> 03:07:58.440
But they will have M.

03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:00.440
They should say, trust them.

03:08:00.440 --> 03:08:02.440
You can live with them.

03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:04.440
See that?

03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:06.440
You're the mayor.

03:08:06.440 --> 03:08:08.440
I know.

03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:10.440
Me?

03:08:10.440 --> 03:08:12.440
She isn't a super.

03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:14.440
She'll see you working on it.

03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:16.440
What are you doing?

03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:18.440
Okay, thanks.

03:08:18.440 --> 03:08:20.440
I'll see you later.

03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:28.440
It's fun to do an episode 7.

03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:32.440
But I don't know how people will know.

03:08:32.440 --> 03:08:34.440
I figured it was okay to do an episode 7 today.

03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:36.440
It was a bit rainy.

03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:38.440
But she said it was not.

03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:40.440
It was a lot.

03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:44.440
A lot of stuff was in French.

03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:48.440
Which brings me to a good point.

03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:50.440
So I was afraid to look at it.

03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:52.440
I don't understand what it meant.

03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:54.440
Just to take a look at it.

03:08:54.440 --> 03:08:56.440
I'm a hard guy, right?

03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:00.440
That's concerning.

03:09:00.440 --> 03:09:02.440
So that's why I just ran it over.

03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:04.440
I'll forward it to you.

03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:06.440
That's what I said to David.

03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:08.440
I don't know.

03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:10.440
I would really like to use that against him somehow.

03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:12.440
I'm trying to do that.

03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:14.440
It's legal for me to give him that.

03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:16.440
But he does it with an afterward.

03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:18.440
I don't know.

03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:20.440
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:22.440
It's hard.

03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:24.440
It's hard to say.

03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:26.440
It's hard to say.

03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:28.440
But it's definitely hard to do what he did.

03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:34.440
So before the show, what's up with you?

03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:36.440
You know?

03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:38.440
You know what's really wrong?

03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:40.440
You know?

03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:42.440
I'm just a musician.

03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:44.440
I used to play football and having...

03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:46.440
Sorry, I didn't go to it.

03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:48.440
I see.

03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:52.440
And there was a guy who lived about me in London.

03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:54.440
He lived in London for you.

03:09:54.440 --> 03:09:56.440
He was really good at acting, with the transition.

03:09:56.440 --> 03:09:58.440
He gave me a list of all that.

03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:00.440
He addresses me.

03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:02.440
He'd be a good guy.

03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:04.440
He'd just have fun and see me.

03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.440
You could tell that or something.

03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:08.440
And he's the one who said,

03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:10.440
I don't think it's going to be that bad.

03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:12.440
And at times it's like $30.

03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:14.440
I mean, I don't think it's going to be that bad.

03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:18.440
I want to spend $30 on some bullshit.

03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:20.440
I would have bought pizza.

03:10:20.440 --> 03:10:22.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:26.440
Well, that was about the sound of it,

03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:28.440
but I mean, I was really focused.

03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:30.440
I have 36 hours to do the single.

03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:32.440
It's been all my time.

03:10:32.440 --> 03:10:34.440
A lot of work.

03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:36.440
A lot of work.

03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:38.440
You know, I don't do that anymore.

03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:40.440
Really?

03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:42.440
Do you miss it?

03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:44.440
I mean, I miss lifestyle.

03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:48.440
No.

03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:50.440
I don't.

03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:52.440
I don't have music,

03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:54.440
but I think I do.

03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:56.440
I don't.

03:10:56.440 --> 03:10:58.440
Cross our lifestyle.

03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:00.440
Yeah, but you got to stop at some points.

03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:02.440
You can't be the other guy doing that.

03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:04.440
Yeah, there's a lot of things.

03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:06.440
It's not like it's still going on.

03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:08.440
Yeah, but still, it's a little creepy.

03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:10.440
We were at a party.

03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:12.440
We didn't see what's happening.

03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:14.440
What's the name of the meeting?

03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:16.440
I didn't talk to him.

03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:18.440
I was like, what's the change that you're doing here?

03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:20.440
You just get out of rehab.

03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:22.440
That's where he's supposed to not do it.

03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:24.440
He's like, let's go get a drink.

03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:26.440
And whatever.

03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:28.440
It's all like rehab.

03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:30.440
Things are supposed to not do it.

03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:32.440
So, you guys,

03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:34.440
we're having everything.

03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:36.440
We got the idea.

03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:40.440
There's a lot of rules.

03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:42.440
We're not supposed to be that broad.

03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:44.440
But first you're out.

03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:46.440
You got laid and be manipulative.

03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:48.440
Because we don't have your drugs here.

03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:50.440
You're trying to compensate.

03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:52.440
I don't know.

03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:54.440
We'll never realize that.

03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:58.440
So you're not allowed to date at all after rehab?

03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:00.440
No.

03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:02.440
So, you're on a graduation?

03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:04.440
You'll get that certain tone of the dopey

03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:06.440
that you don't have for your drug.

03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:08.440
So, the relationship won't fill it up for you.

03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:10.440
But you're always going to end tragically

03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:12.440
because once you're speaking away.

03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:14.440
It's like what you're going to do.

03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:16.440
I'm going to act strong.

03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:18.440
I'm going to act strong.

03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:20.440
That's what I'm going to do.

03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:22.440
We'll just talk about that.

03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:24.440
You don't want to do it?

03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:26.440
No.

03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:28.440
It depends.

03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:30.440
You want to or you want to.

03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:32.440
If you just don't want to.

03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:34.440
If you're stuck with it.

03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:36.440
You have to.

03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:38.440
I mean, I did.

03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:40.440
Well, first of all, Muzza,

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:42.440
he's called Nick.

03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:44.440
We need you to stay at this rehab

03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:46.440
but we figure out everything

03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:48.440
through your mopsie.

03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:50.440
If you don't know anything about Muzza

03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:52.440
or if you don't know anything about Muzza

03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:54.440
you might want to stay out here.

03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:56.440
I was banned from the UK for three years.

03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:58.440
I've never stayed with him.

03:12:58.440 --> 03:13:00.440
Nothing's relationship.

03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:02.440
So, stay the year in the California

03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:04.440
in this rehab.

03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:06.440
We'll figure out the next move.

03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:08.440
And that's when I realized

03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:10.440
that I had to learn really fast

03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:12.440
for my mother.

03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:14.440
Well, the Buddha taught me.

03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:16.440
She got my dad.

03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:18.440
She threw out my dad.

03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:20.440
Not the people, literally.

03:13:20.440 --> 03:13:22.440
But he signed it.

03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:24.440
But in the New York state

03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:26.440
he agreed.

03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:28.440
So, it's not up to her to throw that.

03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:30.440
So, she landed in the fall of 2004

03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:32.440
where she gets everything.

03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:34.440
She's very smart.

03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:36.440
And I didn't know anything about finance.

03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:38.440
But she's doing something that's happening

03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:40.440
where you can learn fast.

03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:42.440
So, that's why I learned finance.

03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:46.440
When you're desperate

03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:48.440
and you have to face off

03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:50.440
and get nothing to lose

03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:52.440
you find like you have intelligence

03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:54.440
and everything.

03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:56.440
Really, everyone has it.

03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:58.440
I think it's the current everybody.

03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:00.440
If you can get rid of the emotion

03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:02.440
because emotion sort of clogs you up

03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:04.440
then you can get more free

03:14:04.440 --> 03:14:06.440
and free of focus.

03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:08.440
It's emotion that really blocks the emotions.

03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:10.440
And emotion is important of course

03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:12.440
but you also need the emotion to

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.440
connect with someone to understand

03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:16.440
all the time.

03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:18.440
You need to control it.

03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:20.440
It's the greatest freedom.

03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:24.440
Well, drugs.

03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:26.440
Drugs help a lot.

03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:28.440
When they train you, you can do it without drugs.

03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:30.440
But at first, no, you can't.

03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:32.440
But you're such an emotional mess.

03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:34.440
So, you take the drug

03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:36.440
which calms you down and makes you feel

03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:38.440
like it's making you focus.

03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:40.440
Like I was not crying.

03:14:40.440 --> 03:14:42.440
I was not keeping my father.

03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:44.440
And it's a reminder that

03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:46.440
that part exists.

03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:48.440
It's when you're pressing that existing

03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:50.440
to get it back.

03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:52.440
So, you just mind yourself that,

03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:54.440
yeah, I was free one day.

03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:56.440
So, you have it.

03:14:56.440 --> 03:14:58.440
So,

03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:00.440
you can then exchange it.

03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:02.440
And you can actually say,

03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:04.440
wait, is that

03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:06.440
is that my thinking?

03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:08.440
Is this you?

03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:10.440
Is that my question for you?

03:15:10.440 --> 03:15:12.440
Is this certain?

03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:14.440
That's the purpose of this.

03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:16.440
Help me if you can hear me.

03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:18.440
So, if you can stop me,

03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:20.440
stop me, stop me.

03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:22.440
We do it with light speakers.

03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:24.440
We have it.

03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:26.440
We get it.

03:15:26.440 --> 03:15:28.440
It's like it becomes instinctive.

03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:30.440
My dad would stop me.

03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:32.440
He's the one.

03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:34.440
You guys never

03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:36.440
trust your feelings.

03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:38.440
Always trust your instincts.

03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:40.440
Your emotions.

03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:42.440
And there's a huge difference between

03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:44.440
your feelings and your emotions

03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:46.440
and your instincts.

03:15:58.440 --> 03:16:00.440
What are you talking about?

03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:02.440
Feelings versus questions.

03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:04.440
Your instinct, I guess.

03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:06.440
Your instinct is my emotion.

03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:08.440
Your instinct is my reply.

03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:10.440
It's like this danger is not in me.

03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:12.440
This is going to serve me, not serve me.

03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:14.440
I'm going to have to calculate it.

03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:16.440
That's the risk.

03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:18.440
I'm going to do the risk.

03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:20.440
Let's see how sad it's going to be.

03:16:20.440 --> 03:16:22.440
That's a year.

03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:24.440
Our brains are so fucking

03:16:24.440 --> 03:16:26.440
amazingly fast.

03:16:26.440 --> 03:16:28.440
We calculate that.

03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:30.440
And it comes out as an instinctive

03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:32.440
instinctive man.

03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:34.440
The emotion of the cloud,

03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:36.440
you can see everything through this wall

03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:38.440
that you're not wanted or not loved

03:16:38.440 --> 03:16:40.440
or you're not wanted or not loved.

03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:42.440
That's the way you're going to friend the world.

03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:44.440
That's the emotion you want to love.

03:16:44.440 --> 03:16:46.440
So focus on the world.

03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:48.440
That's all they want.

03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:50.440
You can do that.

03:16:50.440 --> 03:16:52.440
Your dad just died.

03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:54.440
My dad and my mother.

03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:56.440
It was terrible.

03:16:56.440 --> 03:16:58.440
I used to be

03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:00.440
like a...

03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:02.440
This is a country.

03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:04.440
I didn't do that.

03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:06.440
I didn't do shopping.

03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:08.440
People did it for me.

03:17:08.440 --> 03:17:10.440
All of a sudden, I'm looking at my car.

03:17:10.440 --> 03:17:12.440
I don't know how to do it.

03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:14.440
I don't know how to...

03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:16.440
I didn't think I had it in me.

03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:18.440
They did.

03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:20.440
I don't know. We'll see.

03:17:20.440 --> 03:17:22.440
We'll see.

03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:24.440
It's another thing I'm not going to go there.

03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:28.440
It's a party.

03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:34.440
Hello.

03:17:34.440 --> 03:17:36.440
How are you?

03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:38.440
I'm fine.

03:17:38.440 --> 03:17:40.440
It's been a few years.

03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:42.440
Did you sacrifice?

03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:44.440
No.

03:17:44.440 --> 03:17:46.440
It's been a few years.

03:17:46.440 --> 03:17:48.440
Not as good as this guy's.

03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:50.440
Thanks a lot.

03:17:50.440 --> 03:17:52.440
What did you do for a while?

03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:54.440
For a while.

03:17:54.440 --> 03:17:56.440
For a while?

03:17:56.440 --> 03:17:58.440
Really?

03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:00.440
For a while.

03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:02.440
I was doing a different one.

03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:04.440
We'll see.

03:18:04.440 --> 03:18:06.440
We will do the same thing.

03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:08.440
We will...

03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:10.440
We'll do some research.

03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:12.440
Development drugs.

03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:14.440
Like...

03:18:14.440 --> 03:18:16.440
We'll see.

03:18:16.440 --> 03:18:18.440
Yes, yes.

03:18:18.440 --> 03:18:20.440
I didn't do it.

03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:22.440
Oh, it didn't happen.

03:18:22.440 --> 03:18:24.440
Yep. We didn't all...

03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:26.440
Be born in a...

03:18:26.440 --> 03:18:28.440
Sorry, we weren't born in a...

03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:30.440
We didn't all sort out...

03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:32.440
You would do a different type of drug.

03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:34.440
You would do a different type of drug.

03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:36.440
You would do a different type of drug.

03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:38.440
That's good.

03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:40.440
That's good.

03:18:40.440 --> 03:18:42.440
No, no.

03:18:42.440 --> 03:18:44.440
It's kind of like using drugs.

03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:46.440
That would be huge investments.

03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:48.440
They are going to offer you that.

03:18:48.440 --> 03:18:50.440
No, not anyone would.

03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:52.440
That's like...

03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:54.440
There's been a handle.

03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:56.440
There's been a handle.

03:18:56.440 --> 03:18:58.440
We have the FBI tries to fire

03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:00.440
diversely

03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:02.440
in terms of like backgrounds.

03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:04.440
So we don't...

03:19:04.440 --> 03:19:06.440
We try it.

03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:08.440
There's a big pool of like...

03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:10.440
I want to join...

03:19:10.440 --> 03:19:12.440
I want to join...

03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:14.440
I want to be in contact with...

03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:16.440
I want to join...

03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:18.440
The military.

03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:20.440
We certainly don't want to be a

03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:22.440
100% of that.

03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:24.440
We don't want to be a general...

03:19:24.440 --> 03:19:26.440
We don't want to be a general population.

03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:28.440
We don't want...

03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:30.440
We're going to get a fifth grade teacher

03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:32.440
when I was in high school.

03:19:32.440 --> 03:19:34.440
He also had a rocket scientist.

03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:36.440
Just a lot of people.

03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:38.440
I've had all over the world.

03:19:38.440 --> 03:19:40.440
What was a fifth grade teacher.

03:19:40.440 --> 03:19:42.440
They've heard of people together?

03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:44.440
She's actually a good...

03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:46.440
She's still a good agent.

03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:48.440
She must be a people person.

03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:50.440
She's very good people.

03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:52.440
But she's also a very good...

03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:54.720
and a lot of things that we had to do.

03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:55.720
But...

03:19:55.720 --> 03:19:57.280
You still have the Casanovas?

03:19:57.280 --> 03:19:58.480
And it still exists?

03:19:58.480 --> 03:19:59.480
Casanovas?

03:19:59.480 --> 03:20:00.480
Is it Mars?

03:20:00.480 --> 03:20:01.480
What's that?

03:20:01.480 --> 03:20:02.480
Casanovas.

03:20:02.480 --> 03:20:03.480
It's Mars.

03:20:03.480 --> 03:20:06.480
Yeah, well, we don't know a lot like that.

03:20:06.480 --> 03:20:07.480
It's a little thing.

03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:09.480
No, it's like the old 60s.

03:20:09.480 --> 03:20:12.480
You know, the guys who played, you get information.

03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:13.480
Hello.

03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:15.480
I don't think that's it.

03:20:15.480 --> 03:20:16.480
No, I don't.

03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:18.480
Maybe it's what's waiting for my time.

03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:19.480
That's the 60s.

03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:21.480
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the...

03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:23.520
You know, that's the limit.

03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:25.520
They're working for us right now.

03:20:25.520 --> 03:20:27.520
You guys get fired.

03:20:27.520 --> 03:20:29.520
That's the same.

03:20:29.520 --> 03:20:31.520
Do you know how many roles we have?

03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:34.520
Like, half the stories of your complete bullshit.

03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:37.520
But, you know, it's good that there's a myth out there

03:20:37.520 --> 03:20:40.520
that people make you just sleep with whoever.

03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:42.520
Maybe that's...I'm sure that's what some agents said.

03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:43.520
It's like, no, no, no.

03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:45.520
I'm recruiting you for some super secret mission.

03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:47.520
All you gotta do is sleep with me.

03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:48.520
Right.

03:20:48.560 --> 03:20:50.560
You know, she's probably graduating.

03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:52.560
It's like, I'm working for the FBI.

03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:54.560
That's what I'm doing.

03:20:54.560 --> 03:20:56.560
Oh, the good question, though.

03:20:56.560 --> 03:21:00.560
You guys have unfettered access to, like,

03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:05.560
the sort of the interagency software

03:21:05.560 --> 03:21:08.560
where, like, if I wanted to go hack into your phone,

03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:12.560
I would do it with a new camera.

03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:14.560
Is there a reason why?

03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:16.560
Still, there's not a reason why.

03:21:16.600 --> 03:21:19.600
But there's a powerful cause to be able to use it.

03:21:19.600 --> 03:21:23.600
Like, if I wanted to hack into your phone

03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:27.600
and try your camera, would I need a passport?

03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:28.600
Yeah.

03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:31.600
Or is it, like, is it sure like now?

03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:32.600
Is it in the world?

03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:34.600
See, ten years ago, if you needed a passport,

03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:35.600
it would be very qualified to get one.

03:21:35.600 --> 03:21:38.600
But now it's adjacent to the point where you just ask for it.

03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:39.600
No, it's way harder.

03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:40.600
Really?

03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:41.600
Should that, even that?

03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:44.600
And just thinking theoretically is, like,

03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:45.640
even harder to do.

03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:46.640
Really?

03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:48.640
Yeah, to an effect.

03:21:48.640 --> 03:21:51.640
You're not, you're no longer searching, you're actively

03:21:51.640 --> 03:21:53.640
buttering or flipping.

03:21:53.640 --> 03:21:55.640
That's what happens.

03:21:55.640 --> 03:21:58.640
Yeah, then that, like, a new turn.

03:21:58.640 --> 03:22:00.640
Like, a turn on the camera.

03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:02.640
What's the difference now in a guy sitting in a car

03:22:02.640 --> 03:22:04.640
on top of a car?

03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:07.640
Look, this thing can go places for some guy in a car here.

03:22:07.640 --> 03:22:08.640
Which is...

03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:09.640
In a car?

03:22:09.640 --> 03:22:10.640
In a car.

03:22:10.640 --> 03:22:11.640
In a car in your house.

03:22:11.640 --> 03:22:13.640
Who's a guy in a car?

03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:15.680
Yeah, I thought it was you guys.

03:22:15.680 --> 03:22:16.680
See you guys?

03:22:16.680 --> 03:22:18.680
We're in the triangle.

03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:20.680
I don't think so.

03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:22.680
There's some other interesting things to see.

03:22:22.680 --> 03:22:25.680
You got a guy outside of the brewery.

03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:28.680
So he's in the same place with the triangle.

03:22:28.680 --> 03:22:31.680
And then every time he spots, I mean, it's a wave.

03:22:31.680 --> 03:22:33.680
I thought it was you.

03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:35.680
Might be, like, see a higher-department investigator

03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:37.680
for all I know.

03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:38.680
Maybe that, too.

03:22:38.680 --> 03:22:40.680
Let's take a picture of the place.

03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:42.680
Can I just run it here?

03:22:42.720 --> 03:22:43.720
How would you run it?

03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:45.720
Oh, I got some.

03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:47.720
You got a guy.

03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:49.720
That's the thing.

03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:51.720
I got a guy.

03:22:51.720 --> 03:22:53.720
You used to be seen in the improviser

03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:55.720
and you guys know how to do it.

03:22:55.720 --> 03:22:57.720
Oh, I know.

03:22:57.720 --> 03:22:59.720
That is...

03:22:59.720 --> 03:23:01.720
How do you put that?

03:23:01.720 --> 03:23:02.720
Stuff.

03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:04.720
I mean, you can't do it by yourself.

03:23:04.720 --> 03:23:06.720
The level of this is not as much as it needs to be

03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:09.720
to roll with the times and adapt.

03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:11.760
Like, for example,

03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:14.760
this whole encryption key battle,

03:23:14.760 --> 03:23:18.760
like, you know, we've had previous leaders talk about,

03:23:18.760 --> 03:23:21.760
like, what do you need to give up the encryption key?

03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:23.760
But we all kind of know, like,

03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.760
philosophically, that'll never,

03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:27.760
and that shouldn't happen if it doesn't matter.

03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:29.760
It's, like, a losing battle.

03:23:29.760 --> 03:23:31.760
We're just going to, unfortunately, have to adapt.

03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:34.760
If you just build a job, it's just going to be harder.

03:23:34.760 --> 03:23:37.760
And then many, you know, like,

03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:41.800
these old-school techniques

03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:43.800
that, like, talking to people, like,

03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:45.800
we're talking right now are talking to people

03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:47.800
that are now way more, you know,

03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:49.800
just sitting at your desk

03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:51.800
and looking at, like, a pipeline.

03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:54.800
So it becomes, there's a question figure

03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:56.800
at work sometimes.

03:23:56.800 --> 03:23:58.800
And, like, swaying back tomorrow.

03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:01.800
And this is just me, but it should be hard.

03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:03.800
It should be hard?

03:24:03.800 --> 03:24:05.800
It should be hard.

03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:07.840
It should be hard.

03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:09.840
I agree a lot.

03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:11.840
It should be better.

03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:13.840
It's not the way it works.

03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:15.840
It's the way it works.

03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:17.840
There's nothing, there's no secret to it.

03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:19.840
It's just that, you know,

03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:21.840
I can find it when I want it,

03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:23.840
but I don't really want it yet.

03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:25.840
There's nothing I can do.

03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:27.840
You can do that.

03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:29.840
You know, I mean, I can do it.

03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:31.840
I can do it anywhere in the world.

03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:33.840
You know, once you get there,

03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:35.880
you have to actually keep a secret from all of them.

03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:37.880
That's a weird quote.

03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:39.880
I don't know what to make of it.

03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:41.880
You just have to adapt to it and accept it, I guess.

03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:43.880
It's true.

03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:45.880
It's just, like, you know,

03:24:45.880 --> 03:24:47.880
good pre-LLCs instead of work.

03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:51.880
You don't have your name on it.

03:24:51.880 --> 03:24:53.880
That's beautiful things.

03:24:53.880 --> 03:24:55.880
That's why it's a living dog.

03:24:55.880 --> 03:24:57.880
You can have a fake name.

03:24:57.880 --> 03:24:59.880
You can have a name.

03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:01.880
Perfectly legal.

03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:03.920
It's a good thing to do.

03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:05.920
Jersey and all of Iowa.

03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:07.920
Yeah, it's just like a state.

03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:09.920
It's a state.

03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:11.920
You know what?

03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:13.920
It's very deep, very Jersey.

03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:15.920
I think that's pretty sure.

03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:17.920
Probably.

03:25:17.920 --> 03:25:19.920
It's a good spot.

03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:25.920
Thank you.

03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:27.920
You want to go?

03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:29.920
I'll go.

03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:31.960
I'm trying to be right there.

03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:33.960
Yeah.

03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:37.960
Actually, I think if you prefer

03:25:37.960 --> 03:25:39.960
an opera or a movie,

03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:41.960
I think you can take it.

03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:43.960
I think you can take it.

03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:45.960
I really do.

03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:47.960
No, I don't.

03:25:47.960 --> 03:25:49.960
I think you can take it.

03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:51.960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:53.960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

03:25:53.960 --> 03:25:55.960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:57.960
You can go to a movie.

03:25:57.960 --> 03:25:59.960
You know what?

03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:01.960
You have to do it.

03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:03.960
You have to do it right.

03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:05.960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:07.960
You can do it right.

03:26:07.960 --> 03:26:09.960
You can go to a opera or a movie.

03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:11.960
You can do it.

03:26:11.960 --> 03:26:13.960
You can do it.

03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:16.960
You know what?

03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:18.960
You can do it.

03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:20.960
Okay.

03:26:20.960 --> 03:26:22.960
I'm not sure.

03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:24.960
I mean, I can't worry.

03:26:24.960 --> 03:26:26.960
You can do it.

03:26:26.960 --> 03:26:28.960
That's the thing I learned.

03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:33.960
It's not, I can't, it's, it's all I'm learning.

03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:35.960
It's not only me.

03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:37.960
It's only freedom, too.

03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:39.960
It's a freedom, you know what I'm saying?

03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:42.960
It's worrying about a kid, and then everything is justified.

03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:45.960
Everything is justified if it's for his safety.

03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:47.960
You know?

03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:50.960
That's the interesting part of it.

03:26:50.960 --> 03:26:53.960
Where are you thinking about yourself all the time?

03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:55.960
I don't know.

03:26:55.960 --> 03:26:58.960
I think it's more because of the protector.

03:26:58.960 --> 03:27:02.960
Yeah, or, uh, or...

03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:04.960
I don't know.

03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:06.960
There's a word for it.

03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:08.960
You're a protector of someone.

03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:10.960
Someone else's life is now.

03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:12.960
Yeah.

03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:14.960
Well, it's also pretty scary as shit.

03:27:14.960 --> 03:27:17.960
You know, you're accountable for everything.

03:27:18.960 --> 03:27:21.960
What if it turns out to be an accident?

03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:23.960
Shit.

03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:25.960
That's when you were like, that was the other person.

03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:27.960
Shit.

03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:31.960
Yeah, you're gonna have faith, though.

03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:33.960
That's all for me.

03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:35.960
Here you go.

03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:42.960
Are you serious?

03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:44.960
He's just searing in the sun.

03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:46.960
Well, he's in his heart, right?

03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:48.960
Yeah.

03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:55.960
There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.

03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:57.960
What's that?

03:27:57.960 --> 03:27:59.960
There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.

03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:01.960
And a trade-off and a trade-off.

03:28:01.960 --> 03:28:03.960
It's really big.

03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:05.960
The whole concept of oil contracts is really big.

03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:07.960
Yeah.

03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:09.960
The oil companies are very political.

03:28:09.960 --> 03:28:12.960
There's a lot of other factors that you can think of.

03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:14.960
Yeah?

03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:16.960
Just political factors?

03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:18.960
People that are just fucking...

03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:20.960
I think everyone else is off.

03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:22.960
Well, I think there's a lot of other things.

03:28:22.960 --> 03:28:24.960
Peaks down around the whole...

03:28:24.960 --> 03:28:26.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I don't know.

People have issues with oil contracts.

03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:32.960

What is theculрей to choose

03:30:36.960 --> 03:30:38.960
Why do we need to do that?

03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:41.960
Because we don't need to pay the money out.

Yes.

03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:27.460
It won't

03:31:27.460 --> 03:31:28.460
It won't be big.

03:31:28.460 --> 03:31:33.460
It can stand too low.

03:31:33.460 --> 03:31:38.460
But it didn't end, obviously, I mean, it still worked.

03:31:38.460 --> 03:31:41.460
Yeah, that's right, right now, but like, in a, oh.

03:31:41.460 --> 03:31:42.460
Now it's 11.5.

03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:43.460
11.5?

It dropped to...

03:31:48.460 --> 03:31:49.460
It went up to 12,000.

03:31:49.460 --> 03:31:50.460
It dropped to...

03:31:50.460 --> 03:31:51.460
Yeah.

03:31:51.460 --> 03:31:52.460
4,000.

03:31:52.460 --> 03:31:55.460
At least then I could regulate it.

03:31:55.460 --> 03:31:56.460
Do you like it?

03:31:56.460 --> 03:31:57.460
At least a lot?

03:31:57.460 --> 03:31:59.460
Well, yeah, I don't like it.

03:31:59.460 --> 03:32:02.460
I just like to talk to you regularly.

03:32:02.460 --> 03:32:07.460
Yeah, I still haven't tried it, you know.

03:32:07.460 --> 03:32:11.460
I didn't expect you to do this, but you did.

03:32:11.460 --> 03:32:16.460
You didn't have to decide what you wanted to try.

03:32:16.460 --> 03:32:17.460
You just didn't know.

03:32:17.460 --> 03:32:24.460
You didn't even know how to do it.

03:32:24.460 --> 03:32:25.460
You just flashed in there.

03:32:25.460 --> 03:32:27.460
You could be just pumping down.

03:32:27.460 --> 03:32:28.460
Yeah.

03:32:28.460 --> 03:32:33.460

03:32:38.460 --> 03:32:45.460

03:33:23.460 --> 03:33:24.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:24.460 --> 03:33:25.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:25.460 --> 03:33:28.460
I'm the most iconic person in the room.

03:33:28.460 --> 03:33:30.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:30.460 --> 03:33:32.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:32.460 --> 03:33:33.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:33.460 --> 03:33:35.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:35.460 --> 03:33:36.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:36.460 --> 03:33:37.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:37.460 --> 03:33:38.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:38.460 --> 03:33:39.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:39.460 --> 03:33:41.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:41.460 --> 03:33:42.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:42.460 --> 03:33:43.460
I'm the last one.

03:33:43.460 --> 03:33:45.460
I was the last one.

03:33:45.460 --> 03:33:46.460
I'm the last one on my list.

03:33:46.460 --> 03:33:47.460
I got the person.

03:33:47.460 --> 03:33:50.460
So it's just been decided that there's noney for now.

03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:52.460
How did you figure that out?

03:33:52.460 --> 03:33:56.460
I just put the time last time I logged in.

03:33:56.460 --> 03:33:58.460
I didn't log in. I wasn't going to log in.

03:33:58.460 --> 03:34:00.460
What the fuck? I didn't log in the moment.

03:34:00.460 --> 03:34:02.460
And what would they go for?

03:34:02.460 --> 03:34:04.460
And then I took the last window.

03:34:04.460 --> 03:34:06.460
They didn't even open.

03:34:06.460 --> 03:34:08.460
I think I just sort of assumed it was a log file

03:34:08.460 --> 03:34:10.460
because the windows were open.

03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:12.460
But I actually don't really know what they thought.

03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:14.460
I still think it could be gone.

03:34:14.460 --> 03:34:16.460
When the gun thought I was by.

03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:22.460
Glenn was a funny story.

03:34:22.460 --> 03:34:24.460
So after the Bahamas,

03:34:24.460 --> 03:34:26.460
he slides me back to his house.

03:34:26.460 --> 03:34:28.460
At first I thought I was staying at a hotel.

03:34:28.460 --> 03:34:30.460
He said, go to his house.

03:34:30.460 --> 03:34:32.460
And it turns out I was at his house.

03:34:32.460 --> 03:34:34.460
Why am I staying here?

03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:36.460
It's too hot right now in Florida.

03:34:36.460 --> 03:34:38.460
And it's too hot in DC.

03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:40.460
You can't put your hotel in.

03:34:40.460 --> 03:34:42.460
You've got to stay here.

03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:44.460
Fortunately, my wife is gone on a vacation.

03:34:44.460 --> 03:34:46.460
But you can stay in her room.

03:34:46.460 --> 03:34:48.460
Her room.

03:34:48.460 --> 03:34:50.460
They haven't slept in the same rooms

03:34:50.460 --> 03:34:52.460
for like ten years.

03:34:52.460 --> 03:34:54.460
So they're separated by the same house.

03:34:54.460 --> 03:34:56.460
Okay, so I stayed in his room.

03:34:56.460 --> 03:34:58.460
I was asleep.

03:34:58.460 --> 03:35:00.460
I was so tired and I had some long flight.

03:35:00.460 --> 03:35:02.460
And then I wake up.

03:35:02.460 --> 03:35:04.460
And you know,

03:35:04.460 --> 03:35:06.460
God save your cigarette.

03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:08.460
He has this colonial house with this kitchen porch.

03:35:08.460 --> 03:35:10.460
And I notice there's like a brick

03:35:10.460 --> 03:35:12.460
in the screen window.

03:35:12.460 --> 03:35:14.460
Yeah.

03:35:14.460 --> 03:35:16.460
I sat there the last night.

03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:18.460
I didn't call it a good story.

03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:20.460
What were you doing at 2am last night?

03:35:20.460 --> 03:35:22.460
I was asleep.

03:35:22.460 --> 03:35:24.460
In bed.

03:35:24.460 --> 03:35:26.460
No, you weren't.

03:35:26.460 --> 03:35:28.460
I heard a car.

03:35:28.460 --> 03:35:30.460
I saw you run to the car.

03:35:30.460 --> 03:35:32.460
They gave him something.

03:35:32.460 --> 03:35:34.460
What did you give him?

03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:36.460
I didn't give him anything.

03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:38.460
I have it all in video.

03:35:38.460 --> 03:35:40.460
And it is this huge 1997 camera

03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:42.460
that you know,

03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:44.460
he has not updated its RAM systems.

03:35:44.460 --> 03:35:46.460
Made by Nintendo.

03:35:46.460 --> 03:35:48.460
Nintendo, yeah.

03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:50.460
And so he starts going through his,

03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:52.460
you know, his fast-forward

03:35:52.460 --> 03:35:54.460
thing in his office.

03:35:54.460 --> 03:35:56.460
He takes me to the office.

03:35:56.460 --> 03:35:58.460
He's like, he's so

03:35:58.460 --> 03:36:00.460
convinced that he's caught a Russian spy

03:36:00.460 --> 03:36:02.460
in his house trying to get out of there.

03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:04.460
Dossier just was published.

03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:06.460
He's like,

03:36:06.460 --> 03:36:08.460
he's out.

03:36:08.460 --> 03:36:10.460
And then,

03:36:10.460 --> 03:36:12.460
around 2am,

03:36:12.460 --> 03:36:14.460
we see a hundred shadowy figure

03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:16.460
approach.

03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:18.460
Wow.

03:36:18.460 --> 03:36:20.460
And I see it.

03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:22.460
And I see the figures sort of stumble and fall.

03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:24.460
And they stand up really quick.

03:36:24.460 --> 03:36:26.460
And I look around and see the camera.

03:36:26.460 --> 03:36:28.460
Glad he's a nice little kid.

03:36:28.460 --> 03:36:30.460
He's strong, he's strong.

03:36:30.460 --> 03:36:32.460
And you can't get into.

03:36:32.460 --> 03:36:34.460
He's trying to slice the window screen.

03:36:34.460 --> 03:36:36.460
The only window that doesn't have an alarm

03:36:36.460 --> 03:36:38.460
is the camera.

03:36:38.460 --> 03:36:40.460
No, no, Glenn Simpson.

03:36:40.460 --> 03:36:42.460
He's going to be a Russian spy

03:36:42.460 --> 03:36:44.460
when his son tries to sneak back in

03:36:44.460 --> 03:36:46.460
for a party.

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.460
Still no apology.

03:36:48.460 --> 03:36:50.460
You guys.

03:36:52.460 --> 03:36:54.460
I appreciate that.

03:36:54.460 --> 03:36:56.460
Well, anything else

03:36:56.460 --> 03:36:58.460
that you think you might be able to help out with

03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:00.460
is what I'm going to do is I've written down

03:37:00.460 --> 03:37:02.460
a list of the stuff that

03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:04.460
you see in Access To.

03:37:04.460 --> 03:37:06.460
And I'm going to be able to do

03:37:06.460 --> 03:37:08.460
some of the project stuff

03:37:08.460 --> 03:37:10.460
that would be useful for someone.

03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:12.460
I don't know.

03:37:12.460 --> 03:37:14.460
I can do

03:37:14.460 --> 03:37:16.460
emails.

03:37:16.460 --> 03:37:18.460
Those are pretty easy.

03:37:18.460 --> 03:37:20.460
Again, social engineering

03:37:20.460 --> 03:37:22.460
I'm pretty good at.

03:37:22.460 --> 03:37:24.460
When I get in that zone

03:37:24.460 --> 03:37:26.460
and turn on the charm,

03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:28.460
I can do fun,

03:37:28.460 --> 03:37:30.460
actually enjoy it sometimes.

03:37:30.460 --> 03:37:32.460
Actually, that would be fun.

03:37:32.460 --> 03:37:34.460
If you need...

03:37:34.460 --> 03:37:36.460
I've been focusing

03:37:36.460 --> 03:37:38.460
just as like any concerned citizen,

03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:40.460
but you guys have to be honest

03:37:40.460 --> 03:37:42.460
so you don't have to answer the question.

03:37:42.460 --> 03:37:44.460
I'm sort of Trump-based.

03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:46.460
People come to me

03:37:46.460 --> 03:37:48.460
with a lot of financial documents

03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:50.460
from all over the world.

03:37:50.460 --> 03:37:52.460
A lot of them are just...

03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:54.460
There's a lot of hoops.

03:37:54.460 --> 03:37:56.460
Some people like Ed from Ireland

03:37:56.460 --> 03:37:58.460
is a legit guy.

03:37:58.460 --> 03:38:00.460
The Catrice Jose guy

03:38:00.460 --> 03:38:02.460
is some sort of state-run guy.

03:38:02.460 --> 03:38:04.460
I don't know.

03:38:04.460 --> 03:38:06.460
But I get a lot of that.

03:38:06.460 --> 03:38:08.460
And then

03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:10.460
there's

03:38:10.460 --> 03:38:12.460
the Epstein thing with the sort of

03:38:12.460 --> 03:38:14.460
a side gig for New York Times.

03:38:14.460 --> 03:38:16.460
But I can

03:38:16.460 --> 03:38:18.460
get that data,

03:38:18.460 --> 03:38:20.460
but I did not want to take the step

03:38:20.460 --> 03:38:22.460
to break in.

03:38:22.460 --> 03:38:24.460
If you need me to do that, I'm happy to break in.

03:38:24.460 --> 03:38:26.460
And if it's legal, and you guys are like

03:38:26.460 --> 03:38:28.460
do legally, let's say

03:38:28.460 --> 03:38:30.460
you can do this, I'll make that.

03:38:30.460 --> 03:38:32.460
Good.

03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:34.460
And it would definitely be something

03:38:34.460 --> 03:38:36.460
we would tell you to do with a bunch of other caveats

03:38:36.460 --> 03:38:38.460
and would not be allowed to do.

03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:40.460
But...

03:38:40.460 --> 03:38:42.460
Let's see.

03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:44.460
Let me know if I missed anything too,

03:38:44.460 --> 03:38:46.460
because I have

03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:48.460
Tyler Rossi about MPS.

03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:50.460
He did a man-in-the-mill for

03:38:50.460 --> 03:38:52.460
eating from mom's computer.

03:38:52.460 --> 03:38:54.460
You hacked the rich bank, but not really.

03:38:54.460 --> 03:38:56.460
Right.

03:38:56.460 --> 03:38:58.460
I still can, though.

03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:00.460
I don't know if I'm

03:39:00.460 --> 03:39:02.460
studying or I don't know.

03:39:02.460 --> 03:39:04.460
If you ask me, you should not do any illegal activity.

03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:06.460
That's probably the best

03:39:06.460 --> 03:39:08.460
most of action.

03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:10.460
No, I'm not going to know that for sure.

03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:12.460
I'm not going to talk about that.

03:39:12.460 --> 03:39:14.460
But hacking a bank

03:39:14.460 --> 03:39:16.460
is just hacking the bankers.

03:39:16.460 --> 03:39:18.460
That's true. That's illegal.

03:39:18.460 --> 03:39:20.460
I wouldn't suggest it.

03:39:20.460 --> 03:39:22.460
No, but I mean, in a case,

03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:24.460
it would be something that you would want.

03:39:24.460 --> 03:39:26.460
But can you really hack people like that?

03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:28.460
It's not something

03:39:28.460 --> 03:39:30.460
that we would normally do.

03:39:30.460 --> 03:39:32.460
So, like,

03:39:32.460 --> 03:39:34.460
it's good to know you have the skills, because we could

03:39:34.460 --> 03:39:36.460
put you in a situation where you can talk to other people,

03:39:36.460 --> 03:39:38.460
or we can introduce you to a group,

03:39:38.460 --> 03:39:40.460
or do something else, and you're more complicated.

03:39:40.460 --> 03:39:42.460
But knowing your skills is a good thing to do.

03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:44.460
But it would be rare where I'd be like,

03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:46.460
hey, go hacking a Deutsche Bank,

03:39:46.460 --> 03:39:48.460
deal with this stuff for me,

03:39:48.460 --> 03:39:50.460
because in court, that would be a hell of a thing

03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:52.460
to show that the

03:39:52.460 --> 03:39:54.460
government essentially hacked into a bank to deal with that.

03:39:54.460 --> 03:39:56.460
Well, I know, but there's also

03:39:56.460 --> 03:39:58.460
you guys, I'm sure you have people like this

03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:00.460
in your agency, where other

03:40:00.460 --> 03:40:02.460
agencies have the same types, where you find

03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:04.460
an outside person like myself,

03:40:04.460 --> 03:40:06.460
that you hire basically

03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:08.460
to break the rules, but you don't say to break the rules.

03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:10.460
You need someone that, you don't do that?

03:40:10.460 --> 03:40:12.460
No. No?

03:40:12.460 --> 03:40:14.460
Definitely. Okay.

03:40:14.460 --> 03:40:16.460
I would tell you this, the rule is

03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:18.460
if you were officially working with us,

03:40:18.460 --> 03:40:20.460
you are an extension of the government

03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:22.460
in the sense that if

03:40:22.460 --> 03:40:24.460
you can't do anything I can't do.

03:40:24.460 --> 03:40:26.460
Like a self-contractor.

03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:28.460
Yeah, I guess you can kind of think about it like that.

03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:30.460
You're not employed by the government.

03:40:30.460 --> 03:40:32.460
But like, if I told you to

03:40:32.460 --> 03:40:34.460
hack into something, it'd be like me hacking into it.

03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:36.460
I can't do it, you can't do it.

03:40:36.460 --> 03:40:38.460
Okay, so I'd represent,

03:40:38.460 --> 03:40:40.460
who would you represent in the government?

03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:41.460
Like, or...

03:40:41.460 --> 03:40:42.460
Indirectly, yeah.

03:40:42.460 --> 03:40:44.460
Like, you would give a...

03:40:44.460 --> 03:40:46.460
You would be getting the direction from the government, too, which I mean.

03:40:46.460 --> 03:40:48.460
It's like, there's a floor

03:40:48.460 --> 03:40:49.460
or something.

03:40:49.460 --> 03:40:51.460
The action is filled with government.

03:40:51.460 --> 03:40:52.460
Right, right.

03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:54.460
But technically, it's not, you're not,

03:40:54.460 --> 03:40:55.460
it's not the government.

03:40:55.460 --> 03:40:57.460
And who pays you is not the government either.

03:40:57.460 --> 03:40:59.460
If you're an independent, who,

03:40:59.460 --> 03:41:00.460
how do you pay it?

03:41:00.460 --> 03:41:02.460
You mean, if you were to

03:41:02.460 --> 03:41:03.460
be helping or something?

03:41:03.460 --> 03:41:04.460
Sure.

03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:06.460
Yeah, that's the government.

03:41:06.460 --> 03:41:08.460
Which actually comes from the government?

03:41:08.460 --> 03:41:10.460
No, it would be taxing.

03:41:10.460 --> 03:41:11.460
Oh, okay.

03:41:11.460 --> 03:41:12.460
Yeah.

03:41:12.460 --> 03:41:15.460
But, we don't hire people to break the law.

03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:17.460
Like, to search ventricles.

03:41:17.460 --> 03:41:18.460
Are there any...

03:41:18.460 --> 03:41:19.460
I'm sure they do.

03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:21.460
But that's Oklahoma's stuff.

03:41:21.460 --> 03:41:23.460
So, like, oversees the rules are different, right?

03:41:23.460 --> 03:41:25.460
Like, oversees your

03:41:25.460 --> 03:41:27.460
committing espionage, which is by the fact,

03:41:27.460 --> 03:41:29.460
you know, the fact that we're against the law, right?

03:41:29.460 --> 03:41:30.460
Right.

03:41:30.460 --> 03:41:31.460
And the United States, you know,

03:41:31.460 --> 03:41:33.460
we're still bound by the Constitution.

03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:35.460
So, like, one distinction I want to make, too,

03:41:35.460 --> 03:41:37.460
is like, with the FBI, like,

03:41:37.460 --> 03:41:39.460
we will follow the rules every time.

03:41:39.460 --> 03:41:41.460
I'm never going to tell you to break the rule,

03:41:41.460 --> 03:41:43.460
and like, don't tell me about it or something.

03:41:43.460 --> 03:41:44.460
We'll never deal with that situation.

03:41:44.460 --> 03:41:45.460
Make a win-win.

03:41:45.460 --> 03:41:46.460
Never.

03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:48.460
If I tell you something, like,

03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:50.460
even if I ask you to talk about something

03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:52.460
that could be considered as illegal,

03:41:52.460 --> 03:41:54.460
I'll have a whole document of, like,

03:41:54.460 --> 03:41:56.460
this is exactly what you're allowed to say,

03:41:56.460 --> 03:41:57.460
this is what you're not allowed to say,

03:41:57.460 --> 03:41:59.460
these are the communities,

03:41:59.460 --> 03:42:01.460
and you can't deviate from these four corners.

03:42:01.460 --> 03:42:03.460
Otherwise, we distance ourselves from you,

03:42:03.460 --> 03:42:05.460
because it's not what we ask.

03:42:05.460 --> 03:42:06.460
Okay.

03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:09.460
So, because there's a lot of stuff about what the FBI is,

03:42:09.460 --> 03:42:10.460
or is it?

03:42:10.460 --> 03:42:12.460
Like, just from talking to you today, right?

03:42:12.460 --> 03:42:14.460
There's a lot of stuff that

03:42:14.460 --> 03:42:15.460
you've perceived to be as Jewish.

03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:16.460
Oh, yeah.

03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:17.460
I totally learned a lot today.

03:42:17.460 --> 03:42:18.460
Yeah.

03:42:18.460 --> 03:42:20.460
So, that being said, it's like,

03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:21.460
if you work with us,

03:42:21.460 --> 03:42:23.460
it has to be very clear

03:42:23.460 --> 03:42:25.460
that you're not breaking any rules.

03:42:25.460 --> 03:42:26.460
Right?

03:42:26.460 --> 03:42:28.460
Because we also don't want to work with people

03:42:28.460 --> 03:42:30.460
who are not going to be able to follow directions.

03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:32.460
We talked about it, it makes sense to me,

03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:34.460
but, like, if you're going to give us information, too,

03:42:34.460 --> 03:42:36.460
we have to know that that is the whole fiction.

03:42:36.460 --> 03:42:38.460
You can't, like, take part of it.

03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:40.460
You can't omit the stuff

03:42:40.460 --> 03:42:42.460
that you don't want to tell us,

03:42:42.460 --> 03:42:43.460
and it also has to be everything.

03:42:43.460 --> 03:42:45.460
Because if we find out that it isn't everything,

03:42:45.460 --> 03:42:46.460
then we can't trust you, right?

03:42:46.460 --> 03:42:47.460
Right, right.

03:42:47.460 --> 03:42:48.460
So, you want me to hold back?

03:42:48.460 --> 03:42:49.460
I'm like, Barrett.

03:42:49.460 --> 03:42:52.460
If you ask me, tell me about Barrett.

03:42:52.460 --> 03:42:53.460
So, that would be,

03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:56.460
that would have to be what we have now.

03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:58.460
So, we're not,

03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:02.460
are we really bound to tell you everything I know?

03:43:02.460 --> 03:43:03.460
Not really bound.

03:43:03.460 --> 03:43:04.460
Here's the thing.

03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:06.460
Can I make a mission based on what I think

03:43:06.460 --> 03:43:08.460
is irrelevant and irrelevant?

03:43:08.460 --> 03:43:09.460
Or no?

03:43:09.460 --> 03:43:11.460
It depends, right?

03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:12.460
I mean, like, here's the thing.

03:43:12.460 --> 03:43:14.460
You're not going to be your only source of information.

03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:16.460
That's not how to work either, right?

03:43:16.460 --> 03:43:18.460
I'm going to verify what you say.

03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:19.460
It's like I look at this stuff

03:43:19.460 --> 03:43:20.460
and I'll try to figure out it.

03:43:20.460 --> 03:43:21.460
It's like a report.

03:43:21.460 --> 03:43:22.460
Yeah, it's like a report, right?

03:43:22.460 --> 03:43:24.460
I mean, they're also investigators, so to speak.

03:43:24.460 --> 03:43:26.460
They publish their stuff.

03:43:26.460 --> 03:43:29.460
But, if you were to work with us, right?

03:43:29.460 --> 03:43:32.460
What I need from you most is trust.

03:43:32.460 --> 03:43:34.460
If I can't trust what you're saying,

03:43:34.460 --> 03:43:36.460
if I can't trust you with the information I give you,

03:43:36.460 --> 03:43:38.460
then there's absolutely no reason we would work together.

03:43:38.460 --> 03:43:39.460
Right?

03:43:39.460 --> 03:43:41.460
If we were to involve you in something

03:43:41.460 --> 03:43:43.460
where you are involved with other criminals,

03:43:43.460 --> 03:43:46.460
you say, hey, by the way, I'm working with the FBI,

03:43:46.460 --> 03:43:48.460
that whole thing goes to put them.

03:43:48.460 --> 03:43:49.460
Right?

03:43:49.460 --> 03:43:50.460
I mean, it doesn't help us.

03:43:50.460 --> 03:43:53.460
So that's why you allow this stuff, too.

03:43:53.460 --> 03:43:55.460
If you're here to give us information,

03:43:55.460 --> 03:43:58.460
it was partial information and it was admitted, right?

03:43:58.460 --> 03:44:01.460
There's a part in the court called Discovery, right?

03:44:01.460 --> 03:44:02.460
I'm not sure how it works.

03:44:02.460 --> 03:44:05.460
So with Discovery, we have to provide everything to defend.

03:44:05.460 --> 03:44:07.460
That's how every U.S. government works, right?

03:44:07.460 --> 03:44:10.460
Everything that we have that we're using to prosecute this guy,

03:44:10.460 --> 03:44:11.460
the defense gets a copy of it.

03:44:11.460 --> 03:44:13.460
So they can prosecute any of your stuff, right?

03:44:13.460 --> 03:44:14.460
Right.

03:44:14.460 --> 03:44:16.460
It's getting illegal happening and they...

03:44:16.460 --> 03:44:20.460
So in the case that if you gave us partial information,

03:44:20.460 --> 03:44:22.460
we'd provide that to the defense.

03:44:22.460 --> 03:44:23.460
The defense obviously knows the full story

03:44:23.460 --> 03:44:25.460
because that's the one he's being charged.

03:44:25.460 --> 03:44:27.460
They say, actually, I said a bunch of stuff

03:44:27.460 --> 03:44:28.460
that is exculpatory.

03:44:28.460 --> 03:44:30.460
In other words, stuff that shows that I was innocent,

03:44:30.460 --> 03:44:32.460
but it was selectively filtered out.

03:44:32.460 --> 03:44:34.460
Our whole case would go to shit.

03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:36.460
That's a regular job of having this guy.

03:44:36.460 --> 03:44:37.460
Exactly, right.

03:44:37.460 --> 03:44:40.460
So just how it's not fair for Prasada to do that to you, right?

03:44:40.460 --> 03:44:41.460
Right.

03:44:41.460 --> 03:44:45.460
So as the U.S. government, because we are the U.S. government,

03:44:45.460 --> 03:44:48.460
we play exactly by the rules, every time.

03:44:48.460 --> 03:44:50.460
So is there a guy, a middle manager there, at some point,

03:44:50.460 --> 03:44:54.460
that says, I decide what goes into this reporting

03:44:54.460 --> 03:44:55.460
and what does not go into the court?

03:44:55.460 --> 03:44:56.460
So it's not my decision.

03:44:56.460 --> 03:44:59.460
I just give you all the data you ask for, right?

03:44:59.460 --> 03:45:02.460
Without any omission, and someone else makes that decision.

03:45:02.460 --> 03:45:03.460
Okay.

03:45:03.460 --> 03:45:06.460
Yeah, it's usually the case agent who would be working with you

03:45:06.460 --> 03:45:09.460
who would say, okay, hey, I'm going to write this report.

03:45:09.460 --> 03:45:12.460
And we write it in a way that doesn't disclose everything, right?

03:45:12.460 --> 03:45:14.460
Because if I write your name in my report...

03:45:14.460 --> 03:45:16.460
Can I text your identity, but it's still...

03:45:16.460 --> 03:45:18.460
It doesn't hide anything.

03:45:18.460 --> 03:45:23.460
We'll often put you guys in position to make you look bad,

03:45:23.460 --> 03:45:25.460
but, you know, try to get it.

03:45:25.460 --> 03:45:26.460
Try to get it.

03:45:26.460 --> 03:45:27.460
So anyway...

03:45:27.460 --> 03:45:29.460
Cover your ass and get it.

03:45:29.460 --> 03:45:30.460
Right.

03:45:30.460 --> 03:45:32.460
That's just the general way we work with people

03:45:32.460 --> 03:45:34.460
because we work with a lot of different people

03:45:34.460 --> 03:45:35.460
in a lot of different areas of life.

03:45:35.460 --> 03:45:38.460
Like, I work drugs and drug dealers on my account,

03:45:38.460 --> 03:45:40.460
and, you know, we work with them.

03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:41.460
Do we drug you there?

03:45:41.460 --> 03:45:42.460
Mm-hmm.

03:45:42.460 --> 03:45:43.460
Yeah.

03:45:43.460 --> 03:45:44.460
Because we've got to work our way into the chain.

03:45:44.460 --> 03:45:45.460
How else do you think...

03:45:45.460 --> 03:45:46.460
You can't just get the runners all day, right?

03:45:46.460 --> 03:45:47.460
Right.

03:45:47.460 --> 03:45:49.460
You get in the tenants and you get the people at the top

03:45:49.460 --> 03:45:50.460
and try to...

03:45:50.460 --> 03:45:51.460
Back down.

03:45:51.460 --> 03:45:52.460
I don't care.

03:45:52.460 --> 03:45:53.460
It just fucking has to happen.

03:45:53.460 --> 03:45:54.460
It's completely...

03:45:54.460 --> 03:45:55.460
It's completely...

03:45:55.460 --> 03:45:57.460
Kind of like what we said downstairs.

03:45:57.460 --> 03:45:59.460
It's hard, right?

03:45:59.460 --> 03:46:01.460
It's hard to do this job,

03:46:01.460 --> 03:46:02.460
but it should be hard.

03:46:02.460 --> 03:46:03.460
Because of the rules?

03:46:03.460 --> 03:46:04.460
Yeah.

03:46:04.460 --> 03:46:05.460
I mean, the rules are hard.

03:46:05.460 --> 03:46:08.460
Because that thing would be easy for us to do.

03:46:08.460 --> 03:46:10.460
But we're with the new rules.

03:46:10.460 --> 03:46:12.460
That's why we're going to do it with the new rules.

03:46:12.460 --> 03:46:14.460
Because it's the right thing to do.

03:46:14.460 --> 03:46:16.460
Is it like a chain of evidence or a thing?

03:46:16.460 --> 03:46:17.460
Like, there's like a cartel.

03:46:17.460 --> 03:46:19.460
You think, you know, there's a guy's IP address.

03:46:19.460 --> 03:46:21.460
You know, there's email.

03:46:21.460 --> 03:46:24.460
So now that, like, drug dealers are using,

03:46:24.460 --> 03:46:27.460
like, the encrypted chat,

03:46:27.460 --> 03:46:29.460
it doesn't work to go to the telephone company

03:46:29.460 --> 03:46:33.460
and say, hey, we want to get a title-free on this cell phone

03:46:33.460 --> 03:46:35.460
so we can see all the types of things.

03:46:35.460 --> 03:46:37.460
That's all then in the water.

03:46:37.460 --> 03:46:40.460
And now in order to get their communication,

03:46:40.460 --> 03:46:43.460
like, you'd have to actually get a hold of the phone

03:46:43.460 --> 03:46:44.460
and put...

03:46:44.460 --> 03:46:46.460
And honestly, the way to do it is, like,

03:46:46.460 --> 03:46:48.460
you'd have to get someone inside the group.

03:46:48.460 --> 03:46:50.460
Yeah, close on.

03:46:50.460 --> 03:46:52.460
Yeah, even then, like, you need someone to, like,

03:46:52.460 --> 03:46:54.460
20 or 70 men in that phone.

03:46:54.460 --> 03:46:55.460
Can it be an 8?

03:46:55.460 --> 03:46:56.460
Yeah, I got it.

03:46:56.460 --> 03:46:58.460
It still goes back to, like, that thing

03:46:58.460 --> 03:47:00.460
where you have to get someone inside.

03:47:00.460 --> 03:47:02.460
We can't just sit back and rely.

03:47:02.460 --> 03:47:04.460
Yeah, because it's not...

03:47:04.460 --> 03:47:08.460
It's because it's illegal to hack into the phone

03:47:08.460 --> 03:47:12.460
and to bring it back in Christian.

03:47:12.460 --> 03:47:15.460
So even with a proper warrant, you cannot...

03:47:15.460 --> 03:47:18.460
Oh, yeah, exactly. With a proper warrant, you can't

03:47:18.460 --> 03:47:21.460
because the technology is testing against that now.

03:47:21.460 --> 03:47:23.460
It's not the technology itself.

03:47:23.460 --> 03:47:26.460
But if someone can still do it, it's still doable, right?

03:47:26.460 --> 03:47:30.460
Like, if someone was using some app that the data was still

03:47:30.460 --> 03:47:32.460
housed with the service provider,

03:47:32.460 --> 03:47:34.460
then, yeah, yeah, it would do it.

03:47:34.460 --> 03:47:36.460
Because it's legally within the phone

03:47:36.460 --> 03:47:39.460
and that company legally has the content.

03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:41.460
Is it too much for me to ask, like,

03:47:41.460 --> 03:47:43.460
what is legally outside the phone?

03:47:43.460 --> 03:47:46.460
Well, you can even ask about that.

03:47:46.460 --> 03:47:49.460
And it's just an hacking situation.

03:47:49.460 --> 03:47:52.460
Like, if you know a cartel guy and you have a warrant,

03:47:52.460 --> 03:47:55.460
what can you legally not do?

03:47:55.460 --> 03:47:58.460
Yeah, I think maybe it's easier.

03:47:58.460 --> 03:48:00.460
I'm just curious.

03:48:00.460 --> 03:48:04.460
You can't break any law in order to get access to that guy.

03:48:04.460 --> 03:48:06.460
Still the right?

03:48:06.460 --> 03:48:08.460
No, we can't do that happen.

03:48:08.460 --> 03:48:09.460
You can't?

03:48:09.460 --> 03:48:11.460
Yeah, no, we can't.

03:48:11.460 --> 03:48:13.460
Yeah, throughout the hacking or anything.

03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:15.460
And giving a court order or a search warrant

03:48:15.460 --> 03:48:18.460
to an ISP or a telecom provider is not hacking.

03:48:18.460 --> 03:48:21.460
There's a law that says we can do that.

03:48:21.460 --> 03:48:23.460
The warrant is what permits us to get things

03:48:23.460 --> 03:48:25.460
that are under reasonable expectation of privacy,

03:48:25.460 --> 03:48:27.460
which is what you're hacking.

03:48:27.460 --> 03:48:30.460
You're hacking because it's not publicly available.

03:48:30.460 --> 03:48:32.460
So if you have to breach that expectation of privacy,

03:48:32.460 --> 03:48:35.460
we need a warrant as a government to get that.

03:48:35.460 --> 03:48:37.460
The warrant will specify what you can and can't do.

03:48:37.460 --> 03:48:40.460
And you can break expectation of privacy.

03:48:40.460 --> 03:48:43.460
And if this is all to protect against, you know,

03:48:43.460 --> 03:48:46.460
all the crazy shit that goes on and abuses and things like that.

03:48:46.460 --> 03:48:48.460
So, like, I mean, as much as the government

03:48:48.460 --> 03:48:50.460
does kind of a fuck up shit show,

03:48:50.460 --> 03:48:53.460
I mean, it is put up in a way to protect people,

03:48:53.460 --> 03:48:54.460
protect American people.

03:48:54.460 --> 03:48:56.460
Their privacy, their liberty, things like that.

03:48:56.460 --> 03:48:57.460
So when people think like,

03:48:57.460 --> 03:48:58.460
like my mom does the same thing,

03:48:58.460 --> 03:49:00.460
she's like, well, are you reading my e-mail that I love?

03:49:00.460 --> 03:49:01.460
I don't have time to read your e-mail.

03:49:01.460 --> 03:49:02.460
One.

03:49:02.460 --> 03:49:04.460
And two, like, why would I be reading your e-mail?

03:49:04.460 --> 03:49:05.460
That doesn't make any sense.

03:49:05.460 --> 03:49:06.460
Trust me, I did it.

03:49:06.460 --> 03:49:07.460
You don't want to read your mom's e-mail.

03:49:07.460 --> 03:49:11.460
You don't want to do that.

03:49:11.460 --> 03:49:13.460
Can't go backwards.

03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:14.460
You can't.

03:49:14.460 --> 03:49:15.460
I'm going to do that.

03:49:15.460 --> 03:49:16.460
You can't ever go backwards.

03:49:16.460 --> 03:49:17.460
Yeah, so there's...

03:49:17.460 --> 03:49:18.460
I get it.

03:49:18.460 --> 03:49:20.460
Yeah, there's limitations that we work under, but...

03:49:20.460 --> 03:49:21.460
I like that.

03:49:21.460 --> 03:49:22.460
It's fine.

03:49:22.460 --> 03:49:26.460
It's like, you know, everyone has to have a...

03:49:26.460 --> 03:49:28.460
Yeah, we play about the rules.

03:49:28.460 --> 03:49:30.460
But when we do win, right,

03:49:30.460 --> 03:49:32.460
when we do arrest someone or something like that,

03:49:32.460 --> 03:49:34.460
our cases are, you know, airtight, right?

03:49:34.460 --> 03:49:36.460
We've covered every angle that we can.

03:49:36.460 --> 03:49:37.460
We've got all the information,

03:49:37.460 --> 03:49:39.460
and we've vetted everything to make sure that,

03:49:39.460 --> 03:49:40.460
we have the right person, right?

03:49:40.460 --> 03:49:42.460
We want to make sure we have the right person,

03:49:42.460 --> 03:49:44.460
and we have everything that leads up to it.

03:49:44.460 --> 03:49:46.460
So, anyway, that's all just background

03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:48.460
on how we work and how we work with sources

03:49:48.460 --> 03:49:49.460
and stuff like that.

03:49:49.460 --> 03:49:50.460
That's good.

03:49:50.460 --> 03:49:52.460
I like to do extremely different things.

03:49:52.460 --> 03:49:54.460
Karen, it's really like Tim and Jami.

03:49:54.460 --> 03:49:56.460
Tim and Jami are very different.

03:49:56.460 --> 03:49:58.460
Yeah, because I think that's the other thing, too,

03:49:58.460 --> 03:50:00.460
is if we break the rules to get to our end of goal,

03:50:00.460 --> 03:50:02.460
how are we getting better than the bad guys?

03:50:02.460 --> 03:50:03.460
Right.

03:50:03.460 --> 03:50:04.460
Right, and just fighting.

03:50:04.460 --> 03:50:05.460
Yeah, it's easy.

03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:07.460
I mean, it'd be easy for me to hack into a bunch of stuff,

03:50:07.460 --> 03:50:09.460
but then I'm just a hacker.

03:50:09.460 --> 03:50:12.460
I'm just a criminal doing rogue stuff.

03:50:12.460 --> 03:50:14.460
Oh, vigilante.

03:50:14.460 --> 03:50:16.460
True, but vigilante is just not far.

03:50:16.460 --> 03:50:19.460
Anyway, that goes a whole different term.

03:50:19.460 --> 03:50:21.460
Let's say that for a team of group.

03:50:21.460 --> 03:50:22.460
Okay.

03:50:24.460 --> 03:50:25.460
So, what else do I have?

03:50:25.460 --> 03:50:27.460
Okay, we talked about Irish bank fraud.

03:50:27.460 --> 03:50:31.460
OCCP, you're an admin on Hunter.d.gov.

03:50:31.460 --> 03:50:32.460
Both.

03:50:32.460 --> 03:50:33.460
Both.

03:50:33.460 --> 03:50:34.460
Both.

03:50:34.460 --> 03:50:35.460
Both.

03:50:35.460 --> 03:50:37.460
The use of OCCP.

03:50:37.460 --> 03:50:38.460
OCCRP, yeah.

03:50:38.460 --> 03:50:39.460
OCCRP is down?

03:50:39.460 --> 03:50:40.460
No, it's up.

03:50:40.460 --> 03:50:41.460
Okay, yeah.

03:50:41.460 --> 03:50:42.460
So, you're an admin on goal?

03:50:42.460 --> 03:50:43.460
Yeah.

03:50:43.460 --> 03:50:45.460
Well, I have an accent.

03:50:45.460 --> 03:50:46.460
Okay.

03:50:46.460 --> 03:50:47.460
And...

03:50:47.460 --> 03:50:49.460
I know how to understand the documents, too,

03:50:49.460 --> 03:50:50.460
which is...

03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:53.460
I've learned a lot from the government.

03:50:53.460 --> 03:50:56.460
So, if you need to...

03:50:56.460 --> 03:50:58.460
If you want to know what a CLO is,

03:50:58.460 --> 03:51:00.460
why it's important that it happens in 2008

03:51:00.460 --> 03:51:04.460
in Ireland versus the UK,

03:51:04.460 --> 03:51:06.460
I can help you understand that.

03:51:06.460 --> 03:51:07.460
Okay.

03:51:08.460 --> 03:51:09.460
We'll see.

03:51:09.460 --> 03:51:10.460
You have...

03:51:10.460 --> 03:51:12.460
David Eichrich has...

03:51:12.460 --> 03:51:16.460
Well, I guess he tasks you to get into Epstein D-Mail

03:51:16.460 --> 03:51:19.460
and his Epstein Y-C-Mail.

03:51:19.460 --> 03:51:21.460
You know what he's password-wise?

03:51:21.460 --> 03:51:23.460
It's up line.

03:51:23.460 --> 03:51:24.460
It's a G-21.

03:51:24.460 --> 03:51:25.460
A little...

03:51:25.460 --> 03:51:26.460
I hit it.

03:51:26.460 --> 03:51:28.460
A little same job.

03:51:28.460 --> 03:51:29.460
A little...

03:51:29.460 --> 03:51:30.460
Little...

03:51:30.460 --> 03:51:31.460
A little same job.

03:51:31.460 --> 03:51:32.460
A little same job.

03:51:32.460 --> 03:51:33.460
A little same job.

03:51:33.460 --> 03:51:34.460
A little same job.

03:51:34.460 --> 03:51:35.460
A little same job.

03:51:35.460 --> 03:51:36.460
A little same job.

03:51:36.460 --> 03:51:37.460
A little same job.

03:51:37.460 --> 03:51:38.460
A little same job.

03:51:38.460 --> 03:51:39.460
A little same job.

03:51:39.460 --> 03:51:41.460
You can just look at the old hacks from...

03:51:41.460 --> 03:51:42.460
Oh, right.

03:51:42.460 --> 03:51:43.460
Yeah, pretty easy.

03:51:43.460 --> 03:51:45.460
But don't tell anybody.

03:51:45.460 --> 03:51:49.460
You're also in a single group with Barrett,

03:51:49.460 --> 03:51:54.460
Emma, Van, your friend,

03:51:54.460 --> 03:51:56.460
and like a hundred other people there.

03:51:56.460 --> 03:51:57.460
And a lot of journalists.

03:51:57.460 --> 03:51:58.460
Journalists.

03:51:58.460 --> 03:51:59.460
Journalists.

03:51:59.460 --> 03:52:00.460
Journalists.

03:52:00.460 --> 03:52:01.460
Okay.

03:52:01.460 --> 03:52:02.460
You're capable of doing some email hacks

03:52:02.460 --> 03:52:06.460
and then you'll do some light forensics.

03:52:06.460 --> 03:52:08.460
I guess with this single group...

03:52:08.460 --> 03:52:09.460
There's a big difference.

03:52:09.460 --> 03:52:10.460
Okay.

03:52:10.460 --> 03:52:11.460
Not like that.

03:52:11.460 --> 03:52:12.460
That's...

03:52:12.460 --> 03:52:13.460
I've been practicing a lot with that.

03:52:13.460 --> 03:52:16.460
That's like my latest interest.

03:52:16.460 --> 03:52:17.460
But mostly...

03:52:17.460 --> 03:52:18.460
But with the software.

03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:20.460
It happened, you know, not on my own.

03:52:20.460 --> 03:52:22.460
I'm not coding it or writing it.

03:52:22.460 --> 03:52:24.460
I don't think many people are coding it

03:52:24.460 --> 03:52:25.460
or writing it themselves.

03:52:25.460 --> 03:52:26.460
No, I'm very good.

03:52:26.460 --> 03:52:28.460
I think it's a little bit better than...

03:52:28.460 --> 03:52:30.460
But yeah, with Magnet, it was open source.

03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:32.460
But with Magnet, of course, it's better.

03:52:32.460 --> 03:52:33.460
Yeah, it's not like that.

03:52:33.460 --> 03:52:34.460
I can prove that to you.

03:52:34.460 --> 03:52:37.460
You need to do a demonstration of that.

03:52:37.460 --> 03:52:38.460
Okay.

03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:41.460
In a single group, you said Barrett...

03:52:41.460 --> 03:52:43.460
Barrett said that he's not getting anything legal.

03:52:43.460 --> 03:52:44.460
Is that right?

03:52:44.460 --> 03:52:45.460
Or not getting anything stupid?

03:52:45.460 --> 03:52:46.460
No.

03:52:46.460 --> 03:52:48.460
He's always saying something stupid.

03:52:48.460 --> 03:52:50.460
But he's just, you know, he's such a rabble.

03:52:50.460 --> 03:52:53.460
Let's see what happens after he calms down a bit.

03:52:53.460 --> 03:52:55.460
Because he was high a lot.

03:52:55.460 --> 03:52:56.460
Okay.

03:52:56.460 --> 03:52:57.460
He was very high.

03:52:57.460 --> 03:52:59.460
And he was not happy.

03:52:59.460 --> 03:53:01.460
So it was more worried about him.

03:53:01.460 --> 03:53:03.460
No one really took it seriously.

03:53:03.460 --> 03:53:06.460
You said the rest of the stuff in that group is mainly...

03:53:06.460 --> 03:53:08.460
People miscontented about stuff.

03:53:08.460 --> 03:53:09.460
Yeah.

03:53:09.460 --> 03:53:11.460
You said these steps are basically just bitching a lot.

03:53:11.460 --> 03:53:12.460
But like...

03:53:12.460 --> 03:53:14.460
A lot of, like, fuck movies meant, you know...

03:53:14.460 --> 03:53:17.460
And like, well, actually, I couldn't want to fuck movies meant.

03:53:17.460 --> 03:53:19.460
You know, like, well, why would you want to do that?

03:53:19.460 --> 03:53:21.460
You know, it's like that stuff.

03:53:21.460 --> 03:53:23.460
You know, look at this Twitter post.

03:53:23.460 --> 03:53:26.460
Or this cop just beat up this woman on the street.

03:53:26.460 --> 03:53:28.460
You know, there's a lot of that, too.

03:53:28.460 --> 03:53:29.460
Okay.

03:53:29.460 --> 03:53:30.460
With the riots and stuff.

03:53:30.460 --> 03:53:31.460
Sure.

03:53:31.460 --> 03:53:35.460
But if you're asking if there's, like, organization or people are getting together and, you know...

03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:38.460
I think they're very watched.

03:53:38.460 --> 03:53:40.460
You know, there's no organization.

03:53:40.460 --> 03:53:41.460
It's like, it's just chaos.

03:53:41.460 --> 03:53:42.460
It's fun to see what happens.

03:53:42.460 --> 03:53:44.460
It's like, Mike, I'm out of it, yeah.

03:53:44.460 --> 03:53:46.460
And I meet some interesting people.

03:53:46.460 --> 03:53:48.460
There's nothing, nothing explicitly illegal.

03:53:48.460 --> 03:53:53.460
They don't talk about, you know, collectivity or hacking stuff or anything like that.

03:53:53.460 --> 03:53:54.460
Why?

03:53:54.460 --> 03:53:55.460
Well, yeah, of course.

03:53:55.460 --> 03:53:57.460
No, there is a talk about that, yeah.

03:53:57.460 --> 03:53:59.460
But it's like a friend of mine says,

03:53:59.460 --> 03:54:08.460
Oh, do you know how I get ISPs from Prague, you know, circa 2016?

03:54:08.460 --> 03:54:10.460
Clearly, you're trying to find a common shit, right?

03:54:10.460 --> 03:54:12.460
You know, everyone's a loving the baby.

03:54:12.460 --> 03:54:14.460
You know, stuff like that, you know.

03:54:14.460 --> 03:54:16.460
And if you have it, you have nowhere to get it.

03:54:16.460 --> 03:54:18.460
I think the city's sure to hear you though.

03:54:18.460 --> 03:54:19.460
There's a link.

03:54:19.460 --> 03:54:20.460
Do you know what Irish bankers are?

03:54:20.460 --> 03:54:23.460
The other day, I mean, an Irish banker that knows how to do,

03:54:23.460 --> 03:54:25.460
you know, anybody in Ireland right now.

03:54:25.460 --> 03:54:27.460
I'm here to get some coin telegraph.

03:54:27.460 --> 03:54:29.460
Yeah, stuff like that.

03:54:29.460 --> 03:54:35.460
But like, I'm the only idiot that says, Hey, Emma,

03:54:35.460 --> 03:54:38.460
can you give me a favor and help me hack David Emmerich?

03:54:38.460 --> 03:54:40.460
Because I got to get into his fucking email.

03:54:40.460 --> 03:54:42.460
I'm the only idiot that says that.

03:54:42.460 --> 03:54:44.460
So, yeah.

03:54:44.460 --> 03:54:45.460
Okay.

03:54:45.460 --> 03:54:48.460
So no one else crossed about like who's behind pass or who's behind it?

03:54:48.460 --> 03:54:49.460
Oh, yeah.

03:54:49.460 --> 03:54:50.460
I know.

03:54:50.460 --> 03:54:51.460
Yeah.

03:54:51.460 --> 03:54:53.460
There's a really good big discussion on who's behind Lowe's.

03:54:53.460 --> 03:54:55.460
Oh, Lowe's, I think.

03:54:55.460 --> 03:55:00.460
Or, well, no, the abbreviated version of Lowe's.

03:55:00.460 --> 03:55:01.460
Okay.

03:55:01.460 --> 03:55:03.460
It's like a, whoever did the came out.

03:55:03.460 --> 03:55:04.460
Oh, yeah.

03:55:04.460 --> 03:55:06.460
Who did they think the came out of?

03:55:06.460 --> 03:55:09.460
I think they, I mean, what are some of the opinions of?

03:55:09.460 --> 03:55:12.460
All I know is my opinion right now, as I can remember,

03:55:12.460 --> 03:55:14.460
and I'm not holding back or meaning information,

03:55:14.460 --> 03:55:16.460
because I just can't remember.

03:55:16.460 --> 03:55:18.460
But if you give me time to look, I'll find it for you.

03:55:18.460 --> 03:55:21.460
My opinion is, I think it's Emma.

03:55:21.460 --> 03:55:24.460
The Spanish, the Spanish is broken.

03:55:24.460 --> 03:55:27.460
Again, Maria speaks eight languages for sure.

03:55:27.460 --> 03:55:29.460
I mean, it's not the first.

03:55:29.460 --> 03:55:30.460
It's not a native speaker.

03:55:30.460 --> 03:55:31.460
It's not a native speaker.

03:55:31.460 --> 03:55:36.460
And the angry, the anger sort of matches Emma's anger.

03:55:36.460 --> 03:55:39.460
And the thought process that makes, gets you to write a certain sentence,

03:55:39.460 --> 03:55:41.460
matches Harry's thought process.

03:55:41.460 --> 03:55:42.460
The way I educated it anyway.

03:55:42.460 --> 03:55:44.460
You know, you have to, in order to say the certain sentence,

03:55:44.460 --> 03:55:46.460
you have to think and feel the sort of thing.

03:55:46.460 --> 03:55:48.460
We're in the, we're in this frame group.

03:55:48.460 --> 03:55:50.460
And I see that pattern matched with it.

03:55:50.460 --> 03:55:54.460
So what Spanish document was it that matched?

03:55:54.460 --> 03:55:55.460
The manifesto.

03:55:55.460 --> 03:55:56.460
Oh, the manifesto.

03:55:56.460 --> 03:55:57.460
No.

03:55:57.460 --> 03:55:58.460
Okay.

03:55:58.460 --> 03:55:59.460
Interesting.

03:55:59.460 --> 03:56:00.460
So aside from like the speech pattern,

03:56:00.460 --> 03:56:02.460
is there anything else, any other reason why you think

03:56:02.460 --> 03:56:04.460
the best is behind the game of the island?

03:56:04.460 --> 03:56:07.460
Well, the thought process, obviously.

03:56:07.460 --> 03:56:08.460
Yeah.

03:56:08.460 --> 03:56:09.460
The motivation, I guess, right?

03:56:09.460 --> 03:56:10.460
It's really angry.

03:56:10.460 --> 03:56:11.460
Well, no, no more.

03:56:11.460 --> 03:56:14.460
The motivation, well, you must know.

03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:16.460
I mean, if you're angry, you know,

03:56:16.460 --> 03:56:19.460
the motivation is just, you can do it.

03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:21.460
You know, sometimes, yeah, you're broke, you need some money.

03:56:21.460 --> 03:56:24.460
Or if you want to, you know, see, I'm better than you or not.

03:56:24.460 --> 03:56:26.460
But it's like, here's a challenge.

03:56:26.460 --> 03:56:28.460
You know, that's most of the motivation.

03:56:28.460 --> 03:56:30.460
You should know that though, right?

03:56:30.460 --> 03:56:31.460
But it's different, too.

03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:32.460
Oh, you mean political motivation.

03:56:32.460 --> 03:56:33.460
There's different motivations, too,

03:56:33.460 --> 03:56:34.460
with different hackers, too, right?

03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:36.460
Some hackers are just curious.

03:56:36.460 --> 03:56:38.460
Like, they just want to see if they can break the system.

03:56:38.460 --> 03:56:40.460
But they're the ones who hack for a purpose, right?

03:56:40.460 --> 03:56:42.460
Like, a lot of the hack-tivists out there,

03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:43.460
you know, they'll hack because...

03:56:43.460 --> 03:56:44.460
We'll leak something.

03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:45.460
What about...

03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:47.460
We're talking about we'll leak, aren't we?

03:56:47.460 --> 03:56:48.460
What about we'll leak?

03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:50.460
That's what you're asking about.

03:56:50.460 --> 03:56:52.460
Well, there's a bunch of different types of things.

03:56:52.460 --> 03:56:53.460
I don't know.

03:56:53.460 --> 03:56:58.460
So, the boot leaks appeared on...

03:56:58.460 --> 03:57:01.460
Honestly, I don't know why he was going after it.

03:57:01.460 --> 03:57:03.460
I don't think he did it.

03:57:03.460 --> 03:57:05.460
At first, I think it became the one.

03:57:05.460 --> 03:57:06.460
I don't think he did boot leaks.

03:57:06.460 --> 03:57:08.460
Boot leaks was...

03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:11.460
But you know, and I'm sure you know,

03:57:11.460 --> 03:57:15.460
and I'm sure you know that your computer systems are outdated.

03:57:15.460 --> 03:57:16.460
Right?

03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:17.460
Okay?

03:57:17.460 --> 03:57:19.460
You're fucking really outdated, right?

03:57:19.460 --> 03:57:22.460
And the FBI's computer systems are outdated.

03:57:22.460 --> 03:57:25.460
What do you think the local sheriff's fucking office in Minnesota

03:57:25.460 --> 03:57:28.460
is still running, like, Windows NT, right?

03:57:28.460 --> 03:57:31.460
So, it's not difficult, you know?

03:57:31.460 --> 03:57:34.460
And I think it's consortium.

03:57:34.460 --> 03:57:37.460
My personal opinion, based on no evidence at all,

03:57:37.460 --> 03:57:42.460
is that consortium hackers just have to talk about the...

03:57:42.460 --> 03:57:44.460
the Black Lives Matter, I think, to talk about the police

03:57:44.460 --> 03:57:46.460
and here's the revenge.

03:57:46.460 --> 03:57:49.460
I don't think it was, you know,

03:57:49.460 --> 03:57:51.460
politically motivated by...

03:57:51.460 --> 03:57:56.460
motivated by some, like, left-wing George Soros fucking thing.

03:57:56.460 --> 03:57:58.460
You know, conspiracy theory, right?

03:57:58.460 --> 03:58:00.460
Just angry kids, you know?

03:58:00.460 --> 03:58:01.460
That's it.

03:58:01.460 --> 03:58:02.460
That's right.

03:58:02.460 --> 03:58:03.460
But I could be wrong.

03:58:03.460 --> 03:58:05.460
I'm off the wrong side.

03:58:05.460 --> 03:58:07.460
So, you don't think you have a vested behind that

03:58:07.460 --> 03:58:09.460
that she's behind King Island and what else?

03:58:09.460 --> 03:58:11.460
I personally, I think, came here.

03:58:11.460 --> 03:58:15.460
Because just her reaction to my asking for the 100,000

03:58:15.460 --> 03:58:18.460
in Bitcoin, Deutsche Bank, was sort of took me off.

03:58:18.460 --> 03:58:21.460
You don't react like that if you just move.

03:58:21.460 --> 03:58:23.460
Interesting.

03:58:23.460 --> 03:58:26.460
Yeah, because she doesn't want to share it, though.

03:58:26.460 --> 03:58:27.460
Yeah.

03:58:27.460 --> 03:58:31.460
There's a prize attached to it, so...

03:58:31.460 --> 03:58:32.460
so there was...

03:58:32.460 --> 03:58:33.460
so that...

03:58:33.460 --> 03:58:35.460
he said there was, like, a lot of discussion about who...

03:58:35.460 --> 03:58:37.460
or was it the King and Stink that there was a lot of discussion

03:58:37.460 --> 03:58:39.460
in the group of who...

03:58:39.460 --> 03:58:40.460
Yeah.

03:58:40.460 --> 03:58:44.460
But just for the King and Stink right now, so...

03:58:44.460 --> 03:58:46.460
Well, Formation Towns as well.

03:58:46.460 --> 03:58:48.460
I've done it before.

03:58:48.460 --> 03:58:51.460
But actually, there was no discussion.

03:58:51.460 --> 03:58:52.460
That's interesting.

03:58:52.460 --> 03:58:53.460
You have a good point.

03:58:53.460 --> 03:58:55.460
Yeah, there was no discussion for Formation Towns.

03:58:55.460 --> 03:58:57.460
That means that everybody didn't get it.

03:58:57.460 --> 03:58:58.460
Oh, yeah.

03:58:58.460 --> 03:59:00.460
So that's why it's the way I take out statements.

03:59:00.460 --> 03:59:01.460
Yeah.

03:59:01.460 --> 03:59:03.460
But since there was a lot of discussion for, like,

03:59:03.460 --> 03:59:06.460
payments, that means no one really knew who did it.

03:59:06.460 --> 03:59:08.460
Who did Formation Towns?

03:59:08.460 --> 03:59:09.460
I don't know.

03:59:09.460 --> 03:59:10.460
It wasn't you.

03:59:10.460 --> 03:59:11.460
I just joined the...

03:59:11.460 --> 03:59:12.460
the thing in the...

03:59:12.460 --> 03:59:14.460
well, Marie was stuck in France,

03:59:14.460 --> 03:59:16.460
so that was the summer of last year.

03:59:16.460 --> 03:59:18.460
That's when that happened.

03:59:18.460 --> 03:59:20.460
But I did tell Tim Jeremy, like,

03:59:20.460 --> 03:59:22.460
hey, he did it.

03:59:22.460 --> 03:59:23.460
You know?

03:59:23.460 --> 03:59:24.460
Yeah.

03:59:24.460 --> 03:59:26.460
And, oh, God, oh, the whip, yeah.

03:59:26.460 --> 03:59:28.460
Okay, so I...

03:59:28.460 --> 03:59:30.460
at this point, I'm wondering, you know,

03:59:30.460 --> 03:59:32.460
I was working with the FBI, the source.

03:59:32.460 --> 03:59:33.460
Well, Emma said to me,

03:59:33.460 --> 03:59:36.460
I need you to relay a message to the FBI.

03:59:36.460 --> 03:59:37.460
I was like, what?

03:59:37.460 --> 03:59:39.460
I said, yes, I want you to give these guys a message.

03:59:39.460 --> 03:59:40.460
Okay.

03:59:40.460 --> 03:59:42.460
I'm like, tell them about Formation Towns.

03:59:42.460 --> 03:59:45.460
I want you to give them a list of people you've...

03:59:45.460 --> 03:59:46.460
that are...

03:59:46.460 --> 03:59:47.460
and I have it.

03:59:47.460 --> 03:59:48.460
I can give you the email.

03:59:48.460 --> 03:59:50.460
I'll just forward it to you when I get a chance.

03:59:50.460 --> 03:59:51.460
Remind me, text me.

03:59:51.460 --> 03:59:52.460
I don't forget.

03:59:52.460 --> 03:59:54.460
And I gave it to Tim.

03:59:54.460 --> 03:59:55.460
I gave it to Jeremy.

03:59:55.460 --> 03:59:56.460
And they were not...

03:59:56.460 --> 03:59:57.460
they were like, okay, great.

03:59:57.460 --> 03:59:58.460
We don't really care.

03:59:58.460 --> 03:59:59.460
Like, give one to a Deutsche Bank.

03:59:59.460 --> 04:00:01.460
We don't care about Formation Towns.

04:00:01.460 --> 04:00:04.460
And Emma felt like she was not heard by the FBI

04:00:04.460 --> 04:00:06.460
because she wanted to help,

04:00:06.460 --> 04:00:08.460
but she was not heard.

04:00:08.460 --> 04:00:09.460
She was offering help.

04:00:09.460 --> 04:00:12.460
She said, look, I'll give you guys the data.

04:00:12.460 --> 04:00:13.460
You have a time limit.

04:00:13.460 --> 04:00:15.460
That's why it's going to go live in a month.

04:00:15.460 --> 04:00:18.460
I'll give you three months to find the information.

04:00:18.460 --> 04:00:20.460
I'll forward it to you.

04:00:20.460 --> 04:00:21.460
Okay.

04:00:21.460 --> 04:00:23.460
I'm just writing a line to someone to text you.

04:00:23.460 --> 04:00:24.460
Yeah.

04:00:24.460 --> 04:00:26.460
I don't know if we got it.

04:00:26.460 --> 04:00:28.460
That's what I'm writing.

04:00:28.460 --> 04:00:30.460
Okay.

04:00:30.460 --> 04:00:31.460
All right.

04:00:31.460 --> 04:00:33.460
Any other signal groups that...

04:00:33.460 --> 04:00:35.460
that you're part of that talk about hacking?

04:00:35.460 --> 04:00:36.460
Yeah.

04:00:36.460 --> 04:00:37.460
Well, they're all...

04:00:37.460 --> 04:00:39.460
I mean, all the varied groups.

04:00:39.460 --> 04:00:41.460
I call them varied groups, but they're all, like, options.

04:00:41.460 --> 04:00:42.460
Oh, no.

04:00:42.460 --> 04:00:44.460
The Formation Towns one is still like this.

04:00:44.460 --> 04:00:46.460
But, you know, it's like...

04:00:46.460 --> 04:00:48.460
Well, I mean, no one's really posted for like,

04:00:48.460 --> 04:00:49.460
like seven months.

04:00:49.460 --> 04:00:50.460
Still there.

04:00:50.460 --> 04:00:51.460
Okay.

04:00:51.460 --> 04:00:53.460
And I created a few groups of my own, you know,

04:00:53.460 --> 04:00:55.460
up to a Deutsche Bank group.

04:00:55.460 --> 04:00:56.460
It's generally like a Luke Harding

04:00:56.460 --> 04:00:58.460
and much other journalists.

04:00:58.460 --> 04:01:00.460
Oh, and every...

04:01:00.460 --> 04:01:01.460
there's every...

04:01:01.460 --> 04:01:03.460
once in a while, there's like a fun star chamber

04:01:03.460 --> 04:01:06.460
where you get someone and everyone's going to stop at

04:01:06.460 --> 04:01:09.460
and we put them in a group, you know, and we just sort of tap.

04:01:09.460 --> 04:01:11.460
You know, see what they say.

04:01:11.460 --> 04:01:12.460
Yeah.

04:01:12.460 --> 04:01:14.460
Well, like Louise Matt, she put her in a group

04:01:14.460 --> 04:01:16.460
and he started, you know, what the fuck are you doing?

04:01:16.460 --> 04:01:18.460
Why did you say this about Scott's father?

04:01:18.460 --> 04:01:19.460
Scott's father is a cop.

04:01:19.460 --> 04:01:20.460
Oh.

04:01:20.460 --> 04:01:21.460
She doxxed me.

04:01:21.460 --> 04:01:22.460
Oh.

04:01:22.460 --> 04:01:23.460
What the fuck are you doing?

04:01:23.460 --> 04:01:24.460
Why are you going after his father?

04:01:24.460 --> 04:01:26.460
You know, he's like, well, he's a Russian spy.

04:01:26.460 --> 04:01:27.460
You know, you're just fucking crazy.

04:01:27.460 --> 04:01:29.460
Do you understand what you're fucking doing?

04:01:29.460 --> 04:01:30.460
That's weird.

04:01:30.460 --> 04:01:31.460
Yeah.

04:01:31.460 --> 04:01:32.460
I think...

04:01:32.460 --> 04:01:34.460
Like, David Adderidge was supposed to be in one

04:01:34.460 --> 04:01:37.460
group for COVID, the next guy.

04:01:37.460 --> 04:01:38.460
It was a prize.

04:01:38.460 --> 04:01:40.460
It was a present for me.

04:01:40.460 --> 04:01:43.460
It's like a little beat down room.

04:01:43.460 --> 04:01:44.460
Yeah.

04:01:44.460 --> 04:01:45.460
That's weird.

04:01:45.460 --> 04:01:47.460
Hey, what are you talking about?

04:01:47.460 --> 04:01:48.460
What are you talking about?

04:01:48.460 --> 04:01:49.460
I'm talking about you.

04:01:49.460 --> 04:01:50.460
What?

04:01:50.460 --> 04:01:51.460
Cool.

04:01:51.460 --> 04:01:53.460
Anything else that I missed?

04:01:53.460 --> 04:01:55.460
Anything else that you think that...

04:01:55.460 --> 04:01:56.460
Yes.

04:01:56.460 --> 04:01:57.460
I'm just...

04:01:57.460 --> 04:01:58.460
I can't remember all I have.

04:01:58.460 --> 04:01:59.460
Yeah, sure.

04:01:59.460 --> 04:02:01.460
But it's the eyes of me.

04:02:01.460 --> 04:02:03.460
If I remember...

04:02:03.460 --> 04:02:05.460
I just...

04:02:05.460 --> 04:02:07.460
I will remember it.

04:02:07.460 --> 04:02:09.460
I have to be in a mindset.

04:02:09.460 --> 04:02:10.460
Sure.

04:02:10.460 --> 04:02:12.460
You know, I mean, like...

04:02:12.460 --> 04:02:14.460
your memory is...

04:02:14.460 --> 04:02:15.460
Yeah.

04:02:16.460 --> 04:02:18.460
Yeah, I was going to ask you about something very specific.

04:02:18.460 --> 04:02:20.460
You could recall more about them.

04:02:20.460 --> 04:02:21.460
Tell me everything you know about everything.

04:02:21.460 --> 04:02:23.460
And right now, I'm like a...

04:02:23.460 --> 04:02:24.460
I'm not even active anymore.

04:02:24.460 --> 04:02:26.460
I'm meeting stuff right now from my memory

04:02:26.460 --> 04:02:27.460
because I'm in this room.

04:02:27.460 --> 04:02:28.460
And I'm a little bit nervous.

04:02:28.460 --> 04:02:29.460
I'm a bit not nervous.

04:02:29.460 --> 04:02:31.460
So my brain is adapted to that point.

04:02:31.460 --> 04:02:33.460
So as soon as I walk out of the room,

04:02:33.460 --> 04:02:34.460
I'm like, oh, we're going to say that.

04:02:34.460 --> 04:02:35.460
Yeah, yeah.

04:02:35.460 --> 04:02:36.460
You know what I mean?

04:02:36.460 --> 04:02:37.460
Okay.

04:02:37.460 --> 04:02:38.460
So...

04:02:38.460 --> 04:02:39.460
Okay.

04:02:39.460 --> 04:02:40.460
Anything else that...

04:02:40.460 --> 04:02:41.460
Oh, in turn?

04:02:41.460 --> 04:02:42.460
Yeah.

04:02:42.460 --> 04:02:43.460
Okay.

04:02:43.460 --> 04:02:44.460
Well, you saw my number so quick.

04:02:44.460 --> 04:02:46.460
Do you think of something that...

04:02:46.460 --> 04:02:48.460
you think would be interested in, you know...

04:02:48.460 --> 04:02:49.460
surely you can always let me know

04:02:49.460 --> 04:02:50.460
and I can find a home for it.

04:02:50.460 --> 04:02:51.460
You think?

04:02:51.460 --> 04:02:53.460
And do you mean to prosecute?

04:02:53.460 --> 04:02:54.460
Do you mean to go after it?

04:02:54.460 --> 04:02:57.460
Do you mean to like to read that is...

04:02:57.460 --> 04:02:58.460
that needs to be stopped?

04:02:58.460 --> 04:02:59.460
Or would you say it's like,

04:02:59.460 --> 04:03:02.460
oh, there's some fun just in hacks happening?

04:03:02.460 --> 04:03:03.460
What do you mean?

04:03:03.460 --> 04:03:05.460
I mean, all those things are...

04:03:05.460 --> 04:03:08.460
I work a very narrow spectrum, right?

04:03:08.460 --> 04:03:09.460
I work cyber-friendly.

04:03:09.460 --> 04:03:10.460
Okay.

04:03:10.460 --> 04:03:11.460
But there's...

04:03:11.460 --> 04:03:12.460
You're a fraud, though.

04:03:12.460 --> 04:03:13.460
Yeah.

04:03:13.460 --> 04:03:15.460
But there's also like counter-terrorism

04:03:15.460 --> 04:03:16.460
or white collar crimes

04:03:16.460 --> 04:03:18.460
or practicing as some children

04:03:18.460 --> 04:03:20.460
in national security threats.

04:03:20.460 --> 04:03:22.460
Oh, there's a couple lawyers.

04:03:22.460 --> 04:03:23.460
Okay.

04:03:23.460 --> 04:03:24.460
So I get...

04:03:24.460 --> 04:03:25.460
There's people that call...

04:03:25.460 --> 04:03:27.460
they claim to be lawyers.

04:03:27.460 --> 04:03:28.460
Okay.

04:03:28.460 --> 04:03:30.460
And they ask me to do a bunch of stuff.

04:03:30.460 --> 04:03:32.460
First they'll have to do very strange data

04:03:32.460 --> 04:03:34.460
and then they say they're fighting and doing a lawsuit

04:03:34.460 --> 04:03:36.460
against like Iran or something like that

04:03:36.460 --> 04:03:39.460
on behalf of the veterans.

04:03:39.460 --> 04:03:41.460
They have to go collect data for them.

04:03:41.460 --> 04:03:43.460
And it's mostly just...

04:03:43.460 --> 04:03:45.460
I don't know why they're asking.

04:03:45.460 --> 04:03:47.460
I thought it was some spy.

04:03:47.460 --> 04:03:49.460
Oh, like you think they were asking...

04:03:49.460 --> 04:03:51.460
when they collect data,

04:03:51.460 --> 04:03:53.460
you think it was one of the most...

04:03:53.460 --> 04:03:54.460
Yeah.

04:03:54.460 --> 04:03:56.460
They're asking you to have it.

04:03:56.460 --> 04:03:59.460
And I know these two guys out of DC...

04:03:59.460 --> 04:04:01.460
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:04:01.460 --> 04:04:02.460
They...

04:04:02.460 --> 04:04:03.460
I told them to go fuck off,

04:04:03.460 --> 04:04:04.460
but they did fly out here.

04:04:04.460 --> 04:04:05.460
Yeah.

04:04:05.460 --> 04:04:07.460
I mean, they had their e-mail accounts.

04:04:07.460 --> 04:04:08.460
Yeah, no.

04:04:08.460 --> 04:04:10.460
Iran, do you mind if I do that for you?

04:04:10.460 --> 04:04:11.460
Sure.

04:04:11.460 --> 04:04:12.460
Because they're...

04:04:12.460 --> 04:04:13.460
there's something about them that's very off.

04:04:13.460 --> 04:04:15.460
They flew all the way out here from DC

04:04:15.460 --> 04:04:18.460
and then there was a very weird fucking...

04:04:18.460 --> 04:04:19.460
there was a weird experience

04:04:19.460 --> 04:04:20.460
what happened after that.

04:04:20.460 --> 04:04:21.460
Oh, I thought it was true.

04:04:21.460 --> 04:04:22.460
Yeah.

04:04:22.460 --> 04:04:25.460
You did this to hack into Iran?

04:04:25.460 --> 04:04:28.460
No, no, they wanted...

04:04:28.460 --> 04:04:30.460
wire information about money being sent

04:04:30.460 --> 04:04:33.460
from anywhere, any bank to Iran

04:04:33.460 --> 04:04:36.460
during 2009.

04:04:36.460 --> 04:04:38.460
It was just during the Gulf War, please.

04:04:38.460 --> 04:04:39.460
Okay.

04:04:39.460 --> 04:04:42.460
Well, it actually included Iran in 2010 as well.

04:04:42.460 --> 04:04:43.460
Okay.

04:04:43.460 --> 04:04:44.460
I'll...

04:04:44.460 --> 04:04:46.460
I'll e-mail you and do one.

04:04:46.460 --> 04:04:47.460
But, um...

04:04:47.460 --> 04:04:49.460
So the plan right now is...

04:04:49.460 --> 04:04:50.460
I know a Russian guy.

04:04:50.460 --> 04:04:52.460
He works through it, let's say.

04:04:52.460 --> 04:04:53.460
That must be...

04:04:53.460 --> 04:04:54.460
Yeah.

04:04:54.460 --> 04:04:55.460
Or he used to work for us.

04:04:55.460 --> 04:04:56.460
Okay.

04:04:56.460 --> 04:04:58.460
And he really wants to be an American.

04:04:58.460 --> 04:05:00.460
So he can be of very...

04:05:00.460 --> 04:05:02.460
very useful guy to you.

04:05:02.460 --> 04:05:03.460
What do you think?

04:05:03.460 --> 04:05:04.460
Me too.

04:05:04.460 --> 04:05:05.460
Me too?

04:05:05.460 --> 04:05:06.460
Yeah.

04:05:06.460 --> 04:05:08.460
But be careful, because, like, you know,

04:05:08.460 --> 04:05:09.460
he's being monitored.

04:05:09.460 --> 04:05:10.460
Mm-hmm.

04:05:10.460 --> 04:05:11.460
So, uh...

04:05:11.460 --> 04:05:13.460
you know, a person died.

04:05:13.460 --> 04:05:14.460
I did not want to...

04:05:14.460 --> 04:05:15.460
he was a good guy.

04:05:15.460 --> 04:05:16.460
He was a good guy.

04:05:16.460 --> 04:05:17.460
Or is he good?

04:05:17.460 --> 04:05:18.460
Yeah.

04:05:18.460 --> 04:05:19.460
He's traveling all over the world.

04:05:19.460 --> 04:05:20.460
He doesn't have to go back to Russia.

04:05:20.460 --> 04:05:21.460
He keeps being...

04:05:21.460 --> 04:05:22.460
getting...

04:05:22.460 --> 04:05:23.460
He's accepted.

04:05:23.460 --> 04:05:25.460
So he doesn't have to go back.

04:05:25.460 --> 04:05:27.460
And he keeps trying to, you know,

04:05:27.460 --> 04:05:29.460
ask me all, like,

04:05:29.460 --> 04:05:31.460
is there a way or a business?

04:05:31.460 --> 04:05:32.460
Can you introduce me to someone?

04:05:32.460 --> 04:05:33.460
So, like, Bali...

04:05:33.460 --> 04:05:35.460
He's a really good coder.

04:05:35.460 --> 04:05:36.460
I don't know.

04:05:36.460 --> 04:05:37.460
He's a good kind of guy.

04:05:37.460 --> 04:05:38.460
But, yeah.

04:05:38.460 --> 04:05:39.460
Uh, that would be very helpful for you,

04:05:39.460 --> 04:05:40.460
because he does know a lot.

04:05:40.460 --> 04:05:41.460
Well, how do you...

04:05:41.460 --> 04:05:42.460
How do you know me?

04:05:42.460 --> 04:05:43.460
I'm just gonna...

04:05:43.460 --> 04:05:44.460
Uh-huh, traveling.

04:05:44.460 --> 04:05:45.460
Yeah.

04:05:45.460 --> 04:05:46.460
Yeah.

04:05:46.460 --> 04:05:47.460
He's a girlfriend.

04:05:47.460 --> 04:05:48.460
A girlfriend is the daughter

04:05:48.460 --> 04:05:50.460
of a military general.

04:05:50.460 --> 04:05:51.460
That's why.

04:05:51.460 --> 04:05:52.460
Very interesting.

04:05:52.460 --> 04:05:54.460
Um, I think he was the...

04:05:54.460 --> 04:05:55.460
he was a...

04:05:55.460 --> 04:05:58.460
he was tired of making military journals.

04:05:58.460 --> 04:05:59.460
He came to...

04:05:59.460 --> 04:06:01.460
We don't have this position in America,

04:06:01.460 --> 04:06:02.460
but it's like a...

04:06:02.460 --> 04:06:04.460
a nice speaker at the house.

04:06:04.460 --> 04:06:05.460
It's like a...

04:06:05.460 --> 04:06:07.460
It's not a attorney general,

04:06:07.460 --> 04:06:10.460
but somewhere along the lines of a attorney general.

04:06:10.460 --> 04:06:12.460
Um, he's got...

04:06:12.460 --> 04:06:13.460
Yeah.

04:06:13.460 --> 04:06:15.460
That would be a very interesting theme.

04:06:15.460 --> 04:06:16.460
Yeah.

04:06:16.460 --> 04:06:17.460
I mean, and like I said,

04:06:17.460 --> 04:06:18.460
a lot of these things,

04:06:18.460 --> 04:06:19.460
I won't work.

04:06:19.460 --> 04:06:20.460
So, like, well,

04:06:20.460 --> 04:06:21.460
there's, I'll take the information,

04:06:21.460 --> 04:06:22.460
I'll give it to someone else,

04:06:22.460 --> 04:06:23.460
and see if they want to pursue it,

04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:24.460
and they'll probably talk to yours

04:06:24.460 --> 04:06:25.460
and the like that.

04:06:25.460 --> 04:06:26.460
Okay.

04:06:26.460 --> 04:06:27.460
Okay.

04:06:27.460 --> 04:06:28.460
Anyway, that's all good stuff.

04:06:28.460 --> 04:06:30.460
Um, I'd like to do...

04:06:30.460 --> 04:06:31.460
You can install my number

04:06:31.460 --> 04:06:32.460
so you can always, you know,

04:06:32.460 --> 04:06:33.460
reach out to me

04:06:33.460 --> 04:06:34.460
if you forget something or...

04:06:34.460 --> 04:06:35.460
Sure.

04:06:35.460 --> 04:06:36.460
You know, think of something later.

04:06:36.460 --> 04:06:37.460
Um...

04:06:37.460 --> 04:06:38.460
Where does Marla go?

04:06:38.460 --> 04:06:39.460
Yeah.

04:06:39.460 --> 04:06:40.460
So, as far as Marla goes,

04:06:40.460 --> 04:06:41.460
like I said, I think

04:06:41.460 --> 04:06:43.460
our primary goal will still be to

04:06:43.460 --> 04:06:44.460
make sure you look good

04:06:44.460 --> 04:06:45.460
for the investigation.

04:06:45.460 --> 04:06:46.460
Right?

04:06:46.460 --> 04:06:47.460
Um...

04:06:47.460 --> 04:06:48.460
But I can look good.

04:06:48.460 --> 04:06:49.460
I don't know what you mean.

04:06:49.460 --> 04:06:50.460
Like, just make sure

04:06:50.460 --> 04:06:51.460
that the investigator sees

04:06:51.460 --> 04:06:52.460
everything that he or she

04:06:52.460 --> 04:06:53.460
is supposed to see,

04:06:53.460 --> 04:06:55.460
as far as making you

04:06:55.460 --> 04:06:56.460
and Marla, you know,

04:06:56.460 --> 04:06:57.460
good parents,

04:06:57.460 --> 04:06:58.460
and super, uh,

04:06:58.460 --> 04:06:59.460
an adult.

04:06:59.460 --> 04:07:00.460
But my worry, though,

04:07:00.460 --> 04:07:01.460
is that it's already

04:07:01.460 --> 04:07:02.460
it's back again

04:07:02.460 --> 04:07:03.460
just purposely.

04:07:03.460 --> 04:07:04.460
I don't know why.

04:07:04.460 --> 04:07:05.460
Again, I just feel like

04:07:05.460 --> 04:07:06.460
you did it,

04:07:06.460 --> 04:07:07.460
and take the time in it.

04:07:07.460 --> 04:07:09.460
Um, so even if we do show

04:07:09.460 --> 04:07:10.460
our best stage

04:07:10.460 --> 04:07:11.460
and we're the most perfect people

04:07:11.460 --> 04:07:12.460
in the world,

04:07:12.460 --> 04:07:13.460
you'll see it.

04:07:13.460 --> 04:07:14.460
When you read the report,

04:07:14.460 --> 04:07:15.460
you'll see what they did.

04:07:15.460 --> 04:07:18.460
And now it can be...

04:07:18.460 --> 04:07:19.460
I don't know how to fight that,

04:07:19.460 --> 04:07:20.460
but it's something I don't know.

04:07:20.460 --> 04:07:22.460
It's tough not to crack, too,

04:07:22.460 --> 04:07:23.460
because, like I said,

04:07:23.460 --> 04:07:24.460
I mean,

04:07:24.460 --> 04:07:26.460
what would you suggest

04:07:26.460 --> 04:07:27.460
that we do to influence

04:07:27.460 --> 04:07:29.460
what's already been written

04:07:29.460 --> 04:07:30.460
or how the proceedings

04:07:30.460 --> 04:07:32.460
will go on from here?

04:07:32.460 --> 04:07:34.460
Well, I had, you know,

04:07:34.460 --> 04:07:35.460
my advantage,

04:07:35.460 --> 04:07:36.460
uh,

04:07:36.460 --> 04:07:37.460
fucking thing dismissed

04:07:37.460 --> 04:07:39.460
based on their terrible, uh,

04:07:39.460 --> 04:07:40.460
obviously,

04:07:40.460 --> 04:07:41.460
no deep process

04:07:41.460 --> 04:07:42.460
and misjudgment.

04:07:42.460 --> 04:07:43.460
I wrote down a list

04:07:43.460 --> 04:07:44.460
for reaction.

04:07:44.460 --> 04:07:45.460
Um,

04:07:45.460 --> 04:07:46.460
the lies

04:07:46.460 --> 04:07:47.460
are caught in camera.

04:07:47.460 --> 04:07:48.460
Right.

04:07:48.460 --> 04:07:49.460
Versus what they wrote

04:07:49.460 --> 04:07:50.460
in the report.

04:07:50.460 --> 04:07:51.460
And it'll be good

04:07:51.460 --> 04:07:52.460
if you can collect all the evidence

04:07:52.460 --> 04:07:53.460
so that you can show that

04:07:53.460 --> 04:07:54.460
to the judge or whomever.

04:07:54.460 --> 04:07:55.460
Like,

04:07:55.460 --> 04:07:56.460
I assume you're going to fire...

04:07:56.460 --> 04:07:57.460
You fired your attorney

04:07:57.460 --> 04:07:58.460
to hire a new one.

04:07:58.460 --> 04:07:59.460
Like,

04:07:59.460 --> 04:08:00.460
you know,

04:08:00.460 --> 04:08:01.460
because it's probably good

04:08:01.460 --> 04:08:02.460
to get an attorney.

04:08:02.460 --> 04:08:03.460
Because that was another thing

04:08:03.460 --> 04:08:04.460
I wanted to gauge

04:08:04.460 --> 04:08:05.460
what you could do

04:08:05.460 --> 04:08:06.460
and do we need an attorney

04:08:06.460 --> 04:08:07.460
based on what you could do?

04:08:07.460 --> 04:08:08.460
I mean,

04:08:08.460 --> 04:08:09.460
just my personal thing,

04:08:09.460 --> 04:08:10.460
I would probably want an attorney

04:08:10.460 --> 04:08:11.460
based on what I was in your situation.

04:08:11.460 --> 04:08:12.460
And I just, you know,

04:08:12.460 --> 04:08:13.460
this is why people make money

04:08:13.460 --> 04:08:14.460
and you can see it in color.

04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:15.460
Right.

04:08:15.460 --> 04:08:16.460
And like,

04:08:16.460 --> 04:08:17.460
yeah,

04:08:17.460 --> 04:08:18.460
and if this is completely not

04:08:18.460 --> 04:08:19.460
F.D.I.

04:08:19.460 --> 04:08:20.460
but just having friends

04:08:20.460 --> 04:08:21.460
that have gone through the work

04:08:21.460 --> 04:08:22.460
that you want to have a lawyer.

04:08:22.460 --> 04:08:23.460
Yeah.

04:08:23.460 --> 04:08:24.460
I mean,

04:08:24.460 --> 04:08:25.460
you know,

04:08:25.460 --> 04:08:26.460
where you can have a lawyer

04:08:26.460 --> 04:08:27.460
and an attorney.

04:08:27.460 --> 04:08:28.460
You can retell me that

04:08:28.460 --> 04:08:29.460
if you want me to be your lawyer.

04:08:29.460 --> 04:08:30.460
I swear to God,

04:08:30.460 --> 04:08:31.460
you said that.

04:08:31.460 --> 04:08:32.460
I mean,

04:08:32.460 --> 04:08:33.460
I love you very much.

04:08:33.460 --> 04:08:34.460
Yeah.

04:08:34.460 --> 04:08:35.460
It's good that you trust

04:08:35.460 --> 04:08:36.460
you that much.

04:08:36.460 --> 04:08:37.460
I've been...

04:08:37.460 --> 04:08:38.460
Oh, no,

04:08:38.460 --> 04:08:39.460
it's not good.

04:08:39.460 --> 04:08:40.460
I'm just saying that

04:08:40.460 --> 04:08:41.460
a lawyer can represent himself

04:08:41.460 --> 04:08:42.460
as a cool friend.

04:08:42.460 --> 04:08:43.460
I said,

04:08:43.460 --> 04:08:44.460
if you're representing yourself

04:08:44.460 --> 04:08:45.460
in America,

04:08:45.460 --> 04:08:46.460
you're going to laugh at

04:08:46.460 --> 04:08:47.460
the crazy breaking,

04:08:47.460 --> 04:08:48.460
okay?

04:08:48.460 --> 04:08:49.460
And if the boyfriend

04:08:49.460 --> 04:08:50.460
represents the girlfriend,

04:08:50.460 --> 04:08:51.460
you can work,

04:08:51.460 --> 04:08:52.460
right?

04:08:52.460 --> 04:08:53.460
And maybe this will also

04:08:53.460 --> 04:08:54.460
help the young

04:08:54.460 --> 04:08:55.460
and the vulnerable.

04:08:55.460 --> 04:08:56.460
Okay.

04:08:56.460 --> 04:08:59.460
And the court is a lot,

04:08:59.460 --> 04:09:00.460
a lot,

04:09:00.460 --> 04:09:01.460
a lot of emotions,

04:09:01.460 --> 04:09:02.460
right?

04:09:02.460 --> 04:09:03.460
Always remember

04:09:03.460 --> 04:09:04.460
that the judge

04:09:04.460 --> 04:09:05.460
cares about nothing

04:09:05.460 --> 04:09:07.460
except for the case.

04:09:07.460 --> 04:09:08.460
Is it true, though?

04:09:08.460 --> 04:09:09.460
Absolutely.

04:09:09.460 --> 04:09:11.460
And think about it.

04:09:11.460 --> 04:09:12.460
Think about it

04:09:12.460 --> 04:09:14.460
from this perspective.

04:09:14.460 --> 04:09:15.460
Their whole purpose

04:09:15.460 --> 04:09:16.460
for existing

04:09:16.460 --> 04:09:17.460
is to ensure

04:09:17.460 --> 04:09:18.460
the safety of children.

04:09:18.460 --> 04:09:19.460
That's what I want to

04:09:19.460 --> 04:09:20.460
believe is true,

04:09:20.460 --> 04:09:21.460
but that's not what I've seen.

04:09:21.460 --> 04:09:22.460
I've seen only

04:09:22.460 --> 04:09:23.460
people acting their

04:09:23.460 --> 04:09:24.460
own self-interest.

04:09:24.460 --> 04:09:25.460
I haven't seen anything

04:09:25.460 --> 04:09:26.460
else like that

04:09:26.460 --> 04:09:27.460
in this system.

04:09:27.460 --> 04:09:28.460
Well,

04:09:28.460 --> 04:09:29.460
when you talk about

04:09:29.460 --> 04:09:30.460
the lack of

04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:31.460
deep process in it,

04:09:31.460 --> 04:09:32.460
something,

04:09:32.460 --> 04:09:33.460
maybe some things are falling

04:09:33.460 --> 04:09:34.460
apart here,

04:09:34.460 --> 04:09:35.460
always come back

04:09:35.460 --> 04:09:36.460
to what the judge

04:09:36.460 --> 04:09:38.460
is going to ask

04:09:38.460 --> 04:09:40.460
and answer those questions

04:09:40.460 --> 04:09:41.460
for him.

04:09:41.460 --> 04:09:43.460
Does that make sense?

04:09:43.460 --> 04:09:45.460
Because one side is going to

04:09:45.460 --> 04:09:46.460
say,

04:09:46.460 --> 04:09:47.460
oh, this is best for the kids.

04:09:47.460 --> 04:09:48.460
And your argument says,

04:09:48.460 --> 04:09:49.460
this has to be

04:09:49.460 --> 04:09:50.460
best for the kids.

04:09:50.460 --> 04:09:51.460
That's what we're talking

04:09:51.460 --> 04:09:52.460
about.

04:09:52.460 --> 04:09:53.460
We got to make you

04:09:53.460 --> 04:09:54.460
look better.

04:09:54.460 --> 04:09:55.460
And you've got to make

04:09:55.460 --> 04:09:56.460
yourself look better

04:09:56.460 --> 04:09:57.460
than there's nothing

04:09:57.460 --> 04:09:58.460
left.

04:09:58.460 --> 04:09:59.460
Because then the judge

04:09:59.460 --> 04:10:00.460
is going to wait until

04:10:00.460 --> 04:10:01.460
and say,

04:10:01.460 --> 04:10:02.460
this is a better place.

04:10:02.460 --> 04:10:03.460
Was in the experience

04:10:03.460 --> 04:10:04.460
judged like,

04:10:04.460 --> 04:10:05.460
I heard

04:10:05.460 --> 04:10:06.460
Dominion is to

04:10:06.460 --> 04:10:07.460
know the difference

04:10:07.460 --> 04:10:08.460
between the lies

04:10:08.460 --> 04:10:09.460
and the fabrications.

04:10:09.460 --> 04:10:10.460
To know the difference

04:10:10.460 --> 04:10:11.460
between a crazy person

04:10:11.460 --> 04:10:12.460
that's just calling

04:10:12.460 --> 04:10:13.460
every day to

04:10:13.460 --> 04:10:14.460
facility off

04:10:14.460 --> 04:10:15.460
versus a person

04:10:15.460 --> 04:10:16.460
that's concerned.

04:10:16.460 --> 04:10:17.460
And how does the judge

04:10:17.460 --> 04:10:18.460
weigh that

04:10:18.460 --> 04:10:19.460
in front of them?

04:10:19.460 --> 04:10:20.460
To weigh that with

04:10:20.460 --> 04:10:21.460
what the judge

04:10:21.460 --> 04:10:22.460
needed to lay it out

04:10:22.460 --> 04:10:23.460
in front of them?

04:10:23.460 --> 04:10:24.460
What's the

04:10:24.460 --> 04:10:25.460
best kind of evidence

04:10:25.460 --> 04:10:26.460
in front of them?

04:10:26.460 --> 04:10:27.460
OK.

04:10:27.460 --> 04:10:28.460
So you need

04:10:28.460 --> 04:10:29.460
to, like,

04:10:29.460 --> 04:10:30.460
get strong

04:10:30.460 --> 04:10:31.460
and, again,

04:10:31.460 --> 04:10:32.460
you know,

04:10:32.460 --> 04:10:33.460
those are the lawyers

04:10:33.460 --> 04:10:34.460
who, like,

04:10:34.460 --> 04:10:35.460
you need to

04:10:35.460 --> 04:10:36.460
try to organize

04:10:36.460 --> 04:10:37.460
your response

04:10:37.460 --> 04:10:38.460
to those, like,

04:10:38.460 --> 04:10:39.460
your buttocks

04:10:39.460 --> 04:10:40.460
because they're

04:10:40.460 --> 04:10:41.460
representing the facts

04:10:41.460 --> 04:10:42.460
to the judge, not.

04:10:42.460 --> 04:10:43.460
I mean, you could, too.

04:10:43.460 --> 04:10:44.460
No, you're right.

04:10:44.460 --> 04:10:45.460
We're going to get there.

04:10:45.460 --> 04:10:46.460
Yeah, OK.

04:10:46.460 --> 04:10:47.460
But thank you, yeah.

04:10:47.460 --> 04:10:48.460
I'm worried because

04:10:48.460 --> 04:10:49.460
I looked up this judge

04:10:49.460 --> 04:10:50.460
and her reviews were

04:10:50.460 --> 04:10:51.460
not good.

04:10:51.460 --> 04:10:52.460
And I don't expect her

04:10:52.460 --> 04:10:53.460
to have any,

04:10:53.460 --> 04:10:54.460
you know,

04:10:54.460 --> 04:10:55.460
these are the

04:10:55.460 --> 04:10:56.460
things.

04:10:56.460 --> 04:10:57.460
But this was

04:10:57.460 --> 04:10:58.460
100% bad.

04:10:58.460 --> 04:10:59.460
There was nothing good.

04:10:59.460 --> 04:11:00.460
I guess the people that

04:11:00.460 --> 04:11:01.460
put these are more

04:11:01.460 --> 04:11:02.460
motivated to write this.

04:11:03.460 --> 04:11:04.460
I know that, too.

04:11:04.460 --> 04:11:05.460
Like, I've read

04:11:05.460 --> 04:11:06.460
through the lines.

04:11:06.460 --> 04:11:07.460
I've been one

04:11:07.460 --> 04:11:08.460
through lots of cases,

04:11:08.460 --> 04:11:09.460
but I didn't see anybody say

04:11:09.460 --> 04:11:10.460
she did great by

04:11:10.460 --> 04:11:11.460
not one person.

04:11:11.460 --> 04:11:12.460
I only see

04:11:12.460 --> 04:11:13.460
she's married to another

04:11:13.460 --> 04:11:15.460
judge in that same court.

04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:16.460
I see he was

04:11:16.460 --> 04:11:17.460
admonished for his

04:11:17.460 --> 04:11:18.460
handling of the situation.

04:11:18.460 --> 04:11:19.460
She was admonished for this.

04:11:19.460 --> 04:11:20.460
They were,

04:11:20.460 --> 04:11:21.460
they were

04:11:21.460 --> 04:11:22.460
severe.

04:11:22.460 --> 04:11:23.460
Like, I'm

04:11:23.460 --> 04:11:24.460
I'm

04:11:24.460 --> 04:11:25.460
I was focused on

04:11:25.460 --> 04:11:26.460
what's successful,

04:11:26.460 --> 04:11:27.460
the people that are successful,

04:11:27.460 --> 04:11:28.460
right?

04:11:28.460 --> 04:11:29.460
How were they successful?

04:11:29.460 --> 04:11:31.460
They presented

04:11:31.460 --> 04:11:32.460
evidence that

04:11:32.460 --> 04:11:33.460
was more favorable

04:11:33.460 --> 04:11:34.460
for each child.

04:11:34.460 --> 04:11:35.460
Oh.

04:11:36.460 --> 04:11:37.460
That's it.

04:11:37.460 --> 04:11:39.460
It's very narrow,

04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:40.460
and it's really narrow.

04:11:40.460 --> 04:11:41.460
But I do that.

04:11:41.460 --> 04:11:42.460
That's why I'm here.

04:11:42.460 --> 04:11:43.460
That's why I'm frustrated.

04:11:43.460 --> 04:11:44.460
Because this is what

04:11:44.460 --> 04:11:45.460
I do.

04:11:45.460 --> 04:11:46.460
Well, that's what

04:11:46.460 --> 04:11:47.460
you need to give attorney.

04:11:47.460 --> 04:11:48.460
It's clear.

04:11:48.460 --> 04:11:49.460
It's clear.

04:11:49.460 --> 04:11:50.460
If you walk in the room,

04:11:50.460 --> 04:11:51.460
if you guys walk in there,

04:11:51.460 --> 04:11:52.460
anybody who's walked

04:11:52.460 --> 04:11:53.460
into my life

04:11:53.460 --> 04:11:55.460
and read to Steve,

04:11:55.460 --> 04:11:56.460
it's night and day.

04:11:56.460 --> 04:11:57.460
Obviously,

04:11:57.460 --> 04:11:58.460
Marla belongs to this.

04:11:58.460 --> 04:11:59.460
It's,

04:11:59.460 --> 04:12:00.460
I'm not saying that this is

04:12:00.460 --> 04:12:01.460
subjectively.

04:12:01.460 --> 04:12:02.460
I mean, I am,

04:12:02.460 --> 04:12:03.460
but it's clear.

04:12:03.460 --> 04:12:04.460
But to have these

04:12:04.460 --> 04:12:05.460
these people do that

04:12:05.460 --> 04:12:07.460
and come up with

04:12:07.460 --> 04:12:08.460
this,

04:12:08.460 --> 04:12:09.460
when you read it,

04:12:09.460 --> 04:12:10.460
you'll see.

04:12:10.460 --> 04:12:11.460
It's,

04:12:11.460 --> 04:12:12.460
that scares me

04:12:12.460 --> 04:12:13.460
because that shows

04:12:13.460 --> 04:12:14.460
that someone is

04:12:14.460 --> 04:12:15.460
something else is going on.

04:12:15.460 --> 04:12:16.460
There's something else

04:12:16.460 --> 04:12:17.460
I don't know.

04:12:17.460 --> 04:12:18.460
I don't know how to gauge it.

04:12:18.460 --> 04:12:19.460
I don't know how to weigh it.

04:12:19.460 --> 04:12:20.460
I don't know what it is

04:12:20.460 --> 04:12:21.460
and scaring it.

04:12:23.460 --> 04:12:24.460
It's not

04:12:24.460 --> 04:12:25.460
how it should be.

04:12:25.460 --> 04:12:26.460
You know,

04:12:26.460 --> 04:12:27.460
it's how it should be.

04:12:27.460 --> 04:12:28.460
That's the problem.

04:12:28.460 --> 04:12:29.460
I held you earlier.

04:12:29.460 --> 04:12:30.460
We're honest.

04:12:30.460 --> 04:12:31.460
I'll be honest with you now.

04:12:31.460 --> 04:12:32.460
It's just scary.

04:12:32.460 --> 04:12:34.460
It's just scary things.

04:12:34.460 --> 04:12:35.460
That's,

04:12:35.460 --> 04:12:37.460
that's Marie's child

04:12:37.460 --> 04:12:38.460
but it's also yours.

04:12:38.460 --> 04:12:39.460
So,

04:12:39.460 --> 04:12:41.460
you've got to focus on those things.

04:12:41.460 --> 04:12:42.460
And I'll,

04:12:42.460 --> 04:12:43.460
and I'll give you something.

04:12:43.460 --> 04:12:44.460
I'm not going to try

04:12:44.460 --> 04:12:45.460
but hearing this,

04:12:45.460 --> 04:12:47.460
some of what I picked up on

04:12:47.460 --> 04:12:49.460
is an allegation of a beard,

04:12:49.460 --> 04:12:50.460
of a bruise.

04:12:50.460 --> 04:12:51.460
Yeah.

04:12:51.460 --> 04:12:52.460
A black eye.

04:12:52.460 --> 04:12:53.460
Okay.

04:12:53.460 --> 04:12:54.460
Don't be mad about the allegation.

04:12:54.460 --> 04:12:55.460
How do you get privy?

04:12:55.460 --> 04:12:56.460
I know,

04:12:56.460 --> 04:12:57.460
but you can,

04:12:57.460 --> 04:12:58.460
but that's why they picked the shit

04:12:58.460 --> 04:12:59.460
that's hard to disprove.

04:12:59.460 --> 04:13:00.460
How do I go and disprove your phone?

04:13:00.460 --> 04:13:01.460
We have photos from the game.

04:13:01.460 --> 04:13:02.460
Well,

04:13:02.460 --> 04:13:03.460
you said you also had a video crew

04:13:03.460 --> 04:13:04.460
that was following you.

04:13:04.460 --> 04:13:05.460
We have a video crew

04:13:05.460 --> 04:13:06.460
and we have photos of Marlon

04:13:06.460 --> 04:13:07.460
from that day.

04:13:07.460 --> 04:13:08.460
Okay.

04:13:08.460 --> 04:13:09.460
So,

04:13:09.460 --> 04:13:10.460
so then someone says,

04:13:10.460 --> 04:13:11.460
oh, well,

04:13:11.460 --> 04:13:12.460
you need to produce those

04:13:12.460 --> 04:13:14.460
to show that that allegation is false.

04:13:14.460 --> 04:13:16.460
You just have to focus on that.

04:13:16.460 --> 04:13:17.460
Does that make sense?

04:13:17.460 --> 04:13:18.460
That's,

04:13:18.460 --> 04:13:19.460
yeah,

04:13:19.460 --> 04:13:20.460
I mean,

04:13:20.460 --> 04:13:21.460
like it's easy.

04:13:21.460 --> 04:13:22.460
And you need to.

04:13:22.460 --> 04:13:23.460
It sounds easy.

04:13:23.460 --> 04:13:24.460
I can do that

04:13:24.460 --> 04:13:25.460
but they can only say

04:13:25.460 --> 04:13:26.460
something else.

04:13:26.460 --> 04:13:27.460
How do you disprove Marlon

04:13:27.460 --> 04:13:28.460
going through the trash?

04:13:28.460 --> 04:13:29.460
Scouraging for food?

04:13:29.460 --> 04:13:30.460
How do I disprove that?

04:13:30.460 --> 04:13:31.460
At 1 a.m.,

04:13:31.460 --> 04:13:32.460
she says,

04:13:32.460 --> 04:13:33.460
he's going through the trash

04:13:33.460 --> 04:13:34.460
alone,

04:13:34.460 --> 04:13:35.460
trying to get food out of

04:13:35.460 --> 04:13:36.460
garbage dumpsters.

04:13:36.460 --> 04:13:37.460
Marlon,

04:13:37.460 --> 04:13:38.460
an eight-year-old.

04:13:38.460 --> 04:13:39.460
How do I disprove that?

04:13:39.460 --> 04:13:40.460
And that's,

04:13:40.460 --> 04:13:41.460
that's the thing.

04:13:41.460 --> 04:13:42.460
You can't disprove it.

04:13:42.460 --> 04:13:43.460
You can't prove a negative, right?

04:13:43.460 --> 04:13:44.460
You can't disprove.

04:13:44.460 --> 04:13:45.460
Go disprove it.

04:13:45.460 --> 04:13:46.460
You're not,

04:13:46.460 --> 04:13:47.460
tell me,

04:13:47.460 --> 04:13:48.460
prove me you're not guilty.

04:13:48.460 --> 04:13:49.460
A little garlet letter?

04:13:49.460 --> 04:13:50.460
Yeah.

04:13:50.460 --> 04:13:51.460
Yeah.

04:13:51.460 --> 04:13:52.460
That's,

04:13:52.460 --> 04:13:53.460
that's,

04:13:53.460 --> 04:13:54.460
that's,

04:13:54.460 --> 04:13:55.460
that's what I'm trying to say.

04:13:55.460 --> 04:13:56.460
I'm trying to go to the

04:13:56.460 --> 04:13:57.460
top of these lawyers.

04:13:57.460 --> 04:13:58.460
Like,

04:13:58.460 --> 04:13:59.460
they've seen it all.

04:13:59.460 --> 04:14:00.460
They've seen,

04:14:00.460 --> 04:14:01.460
you know,

04:14:01.460 --> 04:14:02.460
they've probably seen

04:14:02.460 --> 04:14:03.460
elements of your story before

04:14:03.460 --> 04:14:04.460
and they know what,

04:14:04.460 --> 04:14:05.460
they hopefully they will know

04:14:05.460 --> 04:14:08.460
what a good response to those

04:14:08.460 --> 04:14:09.460
things are.

04:14:09.460 --> 04:14:10.460
And another thing,

04:14:10.460 --> 04:14:11.460
it's not just being a good,

04:14:11.460 --> 04:14:12.460
like,

04:14:12.460 --> 04:14:13.460
you can be a vicious,

04:14:13.460 --> 04:14:14.460
hard-going lawyer,

04:14:14.460 --> 04:14:15.460
but if you don't understand

04:14:15.460 --> 04:14:16.460
and you don't understand

04:14:16.460 --> 04:14:17.460
the process,

04:14:17.460 --> 04:14:18.460
how are you going to be

04:14:18.460 --> 04:14:19.460
at the other side,

04:14:19.460 --> 04:14:20.460
whether you want or not?

04:14:20.460 --> 04:14:21.460
Yes.

04:14:21.460 --> 04:14:22.460
You have to understand

04:14:22.460 --> 04:14:22.960
Yes.

04:14:22.960 --> 04:14:24.960
You have to understand your situation.

04:14:24.960 --> 04:14:25.460
We don't.

04:14:25.460 --> 04:14:25.960
We don't.

04:14:25.960 --> 04:14:26.960
He didn't tell us anything.

04:14:26.960 --> 04:14:29.960
He didn't want that job to be done.

04:14:29.960 --> 04:14:31.960
He was using us for his own case.

04:14:31.960 --> 04:14:33.460
Can you see that's pretty tricky?

04:14:33.460 --> 04:14:36.960
I can't tell you what to do with your attorney to fire that and get a new one or what kind

04:14:36.960 --> 04:14:37.460
of attorney.

04:14:37.460 --> 04:14:44.460
I just can't do that because I think I'm starting to be in a certain spot as any human would

04:14:44.460 --> 04:14:45.960
just do any process.

04:14:45.960 --> 04:14:48.960
You have to understand the other side of it.

04:14:48.960 --> 04:14:49.460
I did.

04:14:49.460 --> 04:14:54.460
I'm telling you, we accidentally put ourselves in the middle of another case.

04:14:54.460 --> 04:14:57.460
We're being used for someone else's case.

04:14:57.460 --> 04:15:04.460
The lawyer we found, the woman that we recall, wants us to help her with her bigger case.

04:15:04.460 --> 04:15:05.960
That's what we're used for.

04:15:05.960 --> 04:15:08.460
So our lawyer was not working our best interest.

04:15:08.460 --> 04:15:11.460
He's working for his best interest and her best interest.

04:15:11.460 --> 04:15:12.460
That's the problem.

04:15:12.460 --> 04:15:21.460
And that's why I'm fucking, that woman, the judge, knows that because he's been working

04:15:21.460 --> 04:15:24.460
in that group for 30, 20 years.

04:15:24.460 --> 04:15:25.460
Everyone knows each other.

04:15:25.460 --> 04:15:26.460
It's so ancestral down there.

04:15:26.460 --> 04:15:30.460
She knows that, but she's still accepted that what she did.

04:15:30.460 --> 04:15:31.460
And that scares me too.

04:15:31.460 --> 04:15:32.460
He's judged.

04:15:32.460 --> 04:15:38.460
The whole thing used to be, you have to get paternal affairs down there and fucking clean this place up because something's wrong here.

04:15:38.460 --> 04:15:40.460
And these are children.

04:15:40.460 --> 04:15:41.460
It's fucked up.

04:15:41.460 --> 04:15:43.460
You know, they think they're above the law now.

04:15:43.460 --> 04:15:44.460
These people are down there.

04:15:44.460 --> 04:15:45.460
It's fucked up.

04:15:45.460 --> 04:15:46.460
The egos are so big.

04:15:46.460 --> 04:15:47.460
Nope.

04:15:47.460 --> 04:15:51.460
Like, I've seen big egos, like bankers, like billionaires.

04:15:51.460 --> 04:15:54.460
They don't say anything against these lawyers and the judges.

04:15:54.460 --> 04:15:55.460
It's crazy.

04:15:55.460 --> 04:15:57.460
But we don't have your back.

04:15:57.460 --> 04:15:59.460
We're going to have your case.

04:15:59.460 --> 04:16:02.460
That's what I'm telling you.

04:16:02.460 --> 04:16:10.460
For example, he said, clear as day in writing, I am counsel for Bob Brooksman.

04:16:10.460 --> 04:16:11.460
Marie calls him last night.

04:16:11.460 --> 04:16:12.460
We record the conversation.

04:16:12.460 --> 04:16:13.460
He doesn't know.

04:16:13.460 --> 04:16:18.460
Why didn't you say to Tim and Lucy that you were Vowell's counsel?

04:16:18.460 --> 04:16:19.460
I'll fucking Vowell.

04:16:19.460 --> 04:16:20.460
Don't listen to him.

04:16:20.460 --> 04:16:22.460
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

04:16:22.460 --> 04:16:23.460
Vowell's an idiot.

04:16:23.460 --> 04:16:24.460
Vowell's a bully.

04:16:24.460 --> 04:16:25.460
He's going to ruin you.

04:16:25.460 --> 04:16:26.460
He's going to screw up your case.

04:16:26.460 --> 04:16:27.460
You need to drop Vowell.

04:16:27.460 --> 04:16:29.460
No, but you didn't answer my question.

04:16:29.460 --> 04:16:31.460
How is it that you said this?

04:16:31.460 --> 04:16:33.460
I mean, it's right here in the email.

04:16:33.460 --> 04:16:34.460
I'm looking at it.

04:16:34.460 --> 04:16:35.460
I did not say that, Marie.

04:16:35.460 --> 04:16:36.460
I said, I'm your counsel.

04:16:36.460 --> 04:16:37.460
I'm Marie's counsel.

04:16:37.460 --> 04:16:38.460
And I'm here to help.

04:16:38.460 --> 04:16:39.460
That's it.

04:16:39.460 --> 04:16:40.460
You want to talk about this?

04:16:40.460 --> 04:16:41.460
You want to talk about going with Vowell?

04:16:41.460 --> 04:16:42.460
I can walk away anytime.

04:16:42.460 --> 04:16:45.460
I don't need this case for 30 minutes of this.

04:16:45.460 --> 04:16:46.460
All right.

04:16:46.460 --> 04:16:48.460
He was denying reality.

04:16:48.460 --> 04:16:49.460
Okay.

04:16:49.460 --> 04:16:50.460
That's scary.

04:16:50.460 --> 04:16:51.460
That's your attorney.

04:16:51.460 --> 04:16:52.460
That was our attorney.

04:16:52.460 --> 04:16:53.460
That's my attorney.

04:16:53.460 --> 04:16:54.460
That's your attorney.

04:16:54.460 --> 04:16:57.460
Yeah, but that's also the relationship with the judge.

04:16:57.460 --> 04:16:58.460
That's what I'm saying.

04:16:58.460 --> 04:17:00.460
It's like that, don't it?

04:17:00.460 --> 04:17:03.460
It seems like we're correcting it from wrong.

04:17:03.460 --> 04:17:06.460
Your frustration is that you believe that there's corruption at the judicial level.

04:17:06.460 --> 04:17:07.460
Like the judge is corrupt.

04:17:07.460 --> 04:17:08.460
Yeah.

04:17:08.460 --> 04:17:09.460
That's the problem.

04:17:09.460 --> 04:17:10.460
Absolutely.

04:17:10.460 --> 04:17:11.460
Yeah.

04:17:11.460 --> 04:17:12.460
So, yeah.

04:17:12.460 --> 04:17:13.460
No experience with this at all.

04:17:13.460 --> 04:17:15.460
I'm just telling you, my experience with this is where I talk.

04:17:15.460 --> 04:17:19.460
Well, it's because nothing we can tell you about the process is going to make any sense

04:17:19.460 --> 04:17:21.460
if you don't trust the system, right?

04:17:21.460 --> 04:17:24.460
Because right now you don't trust the system because you think the judge is corrupt, right?

04:17:24.460 --> 04:17:27.460
So, then the question is, what is our solution?

04:17:27.460 --> 04:17:28.460
We can't just correct the problem, right?

04:17:28.460 --> 04:17:29.460
That's right.

04:17:29.460 --> 04:17:30.460
We have to find a solution to it.

04:17:30.460 --> 04:17:33.460
And I cannot be, I can't be an asshole and just do it for myself.

04:17:33.460 --> 04:17:35.460
And that's why I say, well, there's other people's children.

04:17:35.460 --> 04:17:39.460
So, if I read about our mind about their kids being taken away from them, we can't...

04:17:39.460 --> 04:17:40.460
Hold on.

04:17:40.460 --> 04:17:41.460
Hold on.

04:17:41.460 --> 04:17:42.460
Right?

04:17:42.460 --> 04:17:46.460
So, like, we can talk all day with you about how to help you.

04:17:46.460 --> 04:17:51.460
But if you don't trust the judge, nothing that we can say is going to make any difference, right?

04:17:51.460 --> 04:17:57.460
So, as far as being a corrupt judge, like if you wanted us to investigate the judge for

04:17:57.460 --> 04:18:01.460
public corruption or something like that, that's a whole other case, a whole other issue that

04:18:01.460 --> 04:18:04.460
we would have to resolve that would take years.

04:18:04.460 --> 04:18:06.460
It's not going to help you.

04:18:06.460 --> 04:18:08.460
So, how do you navigate it?

04:18:08.460 --> 04:18:09.460
Right, right.

04:18:09.460 --> 04:18:14.460
So, the best advice I can give you is that, as unfair as it sounds right now, there seems

04:18:14.460 --> 04:18:17.460
like there's a lot of things that are going on with the judge.

04:18:17.460 --> 04:18:19.460
What we've talked about is true.

04:18:19.460 --> 04:18:22.460
The judges do have a kid that interests that hand.

04:18:22.460 --> 04:18:27.460
Like, you can form a whole conspiracy about why this judge wants to take M away from

04:18:27.460 --> 04:18:28.460
you.

04:18:28.460 --> 04:18:29.460
And it's about M.

04:18:29.460 --> 04:18:32.460
And that's what we have to focus on, right?

04:18:32.460 --> 04:18:36.460
Because if the judge is trying to, you know, screw someone over...

04:18:36.460 --> 04:18:38.460
You're going back to the same...

04:18:38.460 --> 04:18:44.460
Okay, so, what's our solution going to be for a corrupt judge that is just out to fuck

04:18:44.460 --> 04:18:45.460
everyone?

04:18:45.460 --> 04:18:46.460
That's not what I'm saying.

04:18:46.460 --> 04:18:47.460
I'm not saying...

04:18:47.460 --> 04:18:49.460
Do you know how it comes off?

04:18:49.460 --> 04:18:53.460
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like that.

04:18:53.460 --> 04:19:02.460
I mean, in this specific case, we accidentally found a lawyer that has an agenda to get another

04:19:02.460 --> 04:19:03.460
guy, right?

04:19:03.460 --> 04:19:08.460
We fell into this trap, into a circle of friends, they're like a cabal, they're very close to

04:19:08.460 --> 04:19:10.460
each other, they're married to each other for fuck's sake.

04:19:10.460 --> 04:19:13.460
You know each other very well for 20 plus years.

04:19:13.460 --> 04:19:17.460
They feel like they're above the law, they have their own law structure there.

04:19:17.460 --> 04:19:20.460
They decide what happens, not the law.

04:19:20.460 --> 04:19:27.460
And we saw accidentally the triple lambing out into this little cabal and we became a

04:19:27.460 --> 04:19:29.460
tool all of a sudden.

04:19:29.460 --> 04:19:33.460
Now, when we drop this guy, he's not going to be happy about that.

04:19:33.460 --> 04:19:35.460
He knows the judge very well.

04:19:35.460 --> 04:19:37.460
Very fucking well, they're very close.

04:19:37.460 --> 04:19:38.460
You can see it in the...

04:19:38.460 --> 04:19:40.460
You know, they say don't record...

04:19:40.460 --> 04:19:41.460
You know how they record this shit?

04:19:41.460 --> 04:19:42.460
The trials?

04:19:42.460 --> 04:19:44.460
They fucking record everything.

04:19:44.460 --> 04:19:51.460
You know, and so we went through it last night and heard again how he did not defend us.

04:19:51.460 --> 04:19:53.460
I mean, I don't want to get too much into it.

04:19:53.460 --> 04:19:58.460
We actively tried to get him out of the room knowing that Murray was lying in the belt

04:19:58.460 --> 04:19:59.460
under the room, don't worry about it.

04:19:59.460 --> 04:20:02.460
You know Murray, you really have to get him out of the room.

04:20:02.460 --> 04:20:04.460
And that's our lawyer throwing us under the bus.

04:20:04.460 --> 04:20:06.460
And the judge knew it.

04:20:06.460 --> 04:20:08.460
I don't know how to describe it.

04:20:08.460 --> 04:20:12.460
You think if you had a new lawyer it would change the situation?

04:20:12.460 --> 04:20:13.460
No.

04:20:14.460 --> 04:20:17.460
But that's a solution, I think, on the table right now.

04:20:17.460 --> 04:20:18.460
I don't know.

04:20:18.460 --> 04:20:21.460
There might be a good guy, like a stand-up guy.

04:20:21.460 --> 04:20:24.460
And he's told us it's a whole other system down there.

04:20:24.460 --> 04:20:28.460
You need to get a lawyer that's court ordered that knows that system.

04:20:28.460 --> 04:20:29.460
You know, that's your best bet.

04:20:29.460 --> 04:20:32.460
I can get you an expensive lawyer that can do it for you, too.

04:20:32.460 --> 04:20:35.460
But he's not going to be as good as the people that are in that court.

04:20:35.460 --> 04:20:37.460
And that means that it is corrupt.

04:20:37.460 --> 04:20:38.460
They do it amongst each other.

04:20:38.460 --> 04:20:42.460
They have their own star chambers, certain things.

04:20:42.460 --> 04:20:47.460
And so it's Sava who's creating fucking evidence, and she's a social worker.

04:20:47.460 --> 04:20:50.460
She's supposed to have the child's best interests at heart.

04:20:50.460 --> 04:20:51.460
That is her.

04:20:51.460 --> 04:20:54.460
When she was hired she could pay $100,000 a year to do that.

04:20:54.460 --> 04:20:56.460
And the other guy, 200,000,000.

04:20:56.460 --> 04:20:58.460
They're supposed to be good at their job.

04:20:58.460 --> 04:21:00.460
Comes in and starts fucking lying.

04:21:00.460 --> 04:21:02.460
And changing the narrative, read it.

04:21:02.460 --> 04:21:04.460
See how the narrative changed after page 15?

04:21:04.460 --> 04:21:06.460
The narrative changed dramatically.

04:21:06.460 --> 04:21:07.460
You'll see.

04:21:07.460 --> 04:21:09.460
How do you fight that?

04:21:09.460 --> 04:21:11.460
That's fucked up.

04:21:12.460 --> 04:21:13.660
That's what's fucked up.

04:21:13.660 --> 04:21:16.900
What I was my plan was if I am all I have options,

04:21:16.900 --> 04:21:19.940
I'm going to throw it onto the group, more than three

04:21:19.940 --> 04:21:21.740
of them, and say, look, this is a problem.

04:21:21.740 --> 04:21:23.340
I need your help.

04:21:23.340 --> 04:21:24.660
What can you do?

04:21:24.660 --> 04:21:28.500
And that's done with my last, but then you got something.

04:21:28.500 --> 04:21:29.000
It's good.

04:21:29.000 --> 04:21:31.180
I want to get that was my other choice.

04:21:31.180 --> 04:21:33.060
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

04:21:33.060 --> 04:21:34.940
And it's from M, I got to go do it.

04:21:34.940 --> 04:21:36.540
No, totally.

04:21:36.540 --> 04:21:39.780
I mean, in a year, you said to walk away from here,

04:21:39.780 --> 04:21:42.260
but look at other references for lawyers.

04:21:42.260 --> 04:21:44.980
Because you always think about a dad or a friend.

04:21:44.980 --> 04:21:47.540
They had their own reasons for introducing you

04:21:47.540 --> 04:21:49.220
to that lawyer.

04:21:49.220 --> 04:21:52.060
So if you're bowling under and hearing me, it's systemic.

04:21:52.060 --> 04:21:55.740
Like, I'm not having a great, great burden in the world.

04:21:55.740 --> 04:21:57.020
It wins everything.

04:21:57.020 --> 04:21:59.820
But not in this world, because this world is

04:21:59.820 --> 04:22:01.420
run by these people.

04:22:01.420 --> 04:22:02.900
They make their own goals.

04:22:02.900 --> 04:22:07.580
The law that was first followed, they create their own laws.

04:22:07.580 --> 04:22:08.460
That's a problem.

04:22:09.420 --> 04:22:11.180
Let's read the reader for us.

04:22:11.180 --> 04:22:16.740
I think it's going back to thinking about why we're better

04:22:16.740 --> 04:22:19.380
off going in with a lawyer than by yourself.

04:22:19.380 --> 04:22:20.380
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:22:20.380 --> 04:22:21.860
Yeah, I agree.

04:22:21.860 --> 04:22:22.860
Absolutely.

04:22:22.860 --> 04:22:23.860
No, absolutely.

04:22:23.860 --> 04:22:24.860
Yeah.

04:22:24.860 --> 04:22:25.860
I'm going with the lawyer.

04:22:25.860 --> 04:22:26.860
We're fine with the lawyer.

04:22:26.860 --> 04:22:29.340
The thing that we're trying to say,

04:22:29.340 --> 04:22:31.660
like, here's the thing, you have to either trust

04:22:31.660 --> 04:22:33.780
that what we're saying is from experience,

04:22:33.780 --> 04:22:35.380
or you don't have to take our opinion.

04:22:35.380 --> 04:22:37.100
I mean, it's just a opinion of three.

04:22:37.860 --> 04:22:39.820
I'm just so media all the data, I just want

04:22:39.820 --> 04:22:41.380
to make sure you have everything.

04:22:41.380 --> 04:22:43.900
So the thing would be, if your attorney also

04:22:43.900 --> 04:22:47.300
sees that there's this corrupt system where the judge is

04:22:47.300 --> 04:22:49.100
in bed with everyone else, they may

04:22:49.100 --> 04:22:50.220
be able to change a venue.

04:22:50.220 --> 04:22:51.180
They need to do something.

04:22:51.180 --> 04:22:53.260
But they would have that knowledge, right?

04:22:53.260 --> 04:22:54.540
Like, I don't have it now.

04:22:54.540 --> 04:22:57.180
They're not a, I don't do child custody battles,

04:22:57.180 --> 04:22:59.500
but they need to be based on doubt defense, certainly.

04:22:59.500 --> 04:23:00.940
A couple of different occasions.

04:23:00.940 --> 04:23:03.980
But those are different situations, different judges

04:23:03.980 --> 04:23:04.500
to people.

04:23:04.500 --> 04:23:06.740
So whatever training you get, we'll

04:23:06.740 --> 04:23:08.300
be able to look after your best interests.

04:23:08.300 --> 04:23:10.180
The point would be, though, is you have to trust

04:23:10.180 --> 04:23:11.740
that that attorney is going to be good,

04:23:11.740 --> 04:23:13.700
and is going to be looking after your best interests.

04:23:13.700 --> 04:23:15.540
So do your research, and we know we

04:23:15.540 --> 04:23:18.180
can help with that, if that would be the best option.

04:23:18.180 --> 04:23:19.980
But I'm trying to find a good solution for you,

04:23:19.980 --> 04:23:21.740
because I don't want you to walk away from here thinking,

04:23:21.740 --> 04:23:23.980
like, well, if I don't care, I do want to help you.

04:23:23.980 --> 04:23:26.260
But we need to think of realistic ways we can help you.

04:23:26.260 --> 04:23:27.820
And that would be the best way to do it.

04:23:27.820 --> 04:23:28.820
Sorry, maybe you're right.

04:23:28.820 --> 04:23:29.660
I'm just thinking.

04:23:29.660 --> 04:23:31.860
So realistic way would be to play their game,

04:23:31.860 --> 04:23:33.700
find out what their rules are, and play their game.

04:23:33.700 --> 04:23:36.700
So that's the end of it.

04:23:37.660 --> 04:23:39.540
I mean, I don't want you to be upset.

04:23:39.540 --> 04:23:41.860
I mean, it's not emotional, and I understand.

04:23:41.860 --> 04:23:43.060
I've always started throwing out there,

04:23:43.060 --> 04:23:44.820
seeing that we're interested in doing this whole,

04:23:44.820 --> 04:23:47.420
let's take down the system and create a new system in its place.

04:23:47.420 --> 04:23:49.420
But I don't think you're there yet.

04:23:49.420 --> 04:23:51.220
But I do want to do that at some point.

04:23:51.220 --> 04:23:52.980
But right now, I have to get Marla focused.

04:23:52.980 --> 04:23:54.940
I'm just going to say, right now, it's play their game.

04:23:54.940 --> 04:23:55.780
That's fine.

04:23:55.780 --> 04:23:56.660
It's perfectly fine.

04:23:56.660 --> 04:24:01.620
But yeah, OK, no worries.

04:24:01.620 --> 04:24:04.660
And I think some of those things are going to be in your dress.

04:24:04.660 --> 04:24:05.540
You all right?

04:24:05.540 --> 04:24:11.660
Yeah, I think there's a lot of a year of that whole process.

04:24:11.660 --> 04:24:16.060
When we talk here, and I think what I want to make sure you

04:24:16.060 --> 04:24:19.020
understand is that we'll focus on the game special,

04:24:19.020 --> 04:24:21.620
because that's your immediate need, right?

04:24:21.620 --> 04:24:23.540
And then there's the overall need.

04:24:23.540 --> 04:24:25.460
What can we solve quickly?

04:24:25.460 --> 04:24:26.820
What needs to be addressed quickly?

04:24:26.820 --> 04:24:31.060
And then the bigger thing, the bigger aspect of it.

04:24:31.060 --> 04:24:36.180
It's not that we're not interested in that, because we are.

04:24:36.180 --> 04:24:38.380
Yeah, one thing at a time.

04:24:38.380 --> 04:24:41.740
Well, you're here right here.

04:24:41.740 --> 04:24:44.500
What's your number one goal?

04:24:44.500 --> 04:24:46.380
Marla, right?

04:24:46.380 --> 04:24:48.780
So when you ask a question, it's not

04:24:48.780 --> 04:24:52.860
that we're side stepping the issues, whatever it is.

04:24:52.860 --> 04:24:56.100
We're focused on, because we're addressing.

04:24:56.100 --> 04:24:57.540
Oh, no, absolutely.

04:24:57.540 --> 04:24:58.420
You're sorry.

04:24:58.420 --> 04:25:00.180
Yes, I hope that you didn't think

04:25:01.140 --> 04:25:04.460
No, I don't think it's such a, I just, I do this all the time,

04:25:04.460 --> 04:25:07.140
because I mean with this book, I just think you guys,

04:25:07.140 --> 04:25:09.100
you don't know all the data, and if you just knew all the data,

04:25:09.100 --> 04:25:11.340
you'd see how I see it.

04:25:11.340 --> 04:25:12.660
That's what I'm thinking.

04:25:12.660 --> 04:25:13.740
It doesn't mean it's true.

04:25:13.740 --> 04:25:15.300
But it's important to me.

04:25:15.300 --> 04:25:20.260
And yeah, as what you do, and what I've committed myself to do,

04:25:20.260 --> 04:25:22.660
is I want you to understand what we're coming from.

04:25:22.660 --> 04:25:24.260
I don't want you to walk away like,

04:25:24.260 --> 04:25:25.740
I don't want to give a shit about the bigger problems.

04:25:25.740 --> 04:25:26.900
No, you do.

04:25:26.900 --> 04:25:28.860
But right now, you're in front of us.

04:25:28.940 --> 04:25:29.780
How do we help you out?

04:25:29.780 --> 04:25:32.260
Okay, thank you.

04:25:32.260 --> 04:25:34.700
And thank you again.

04:25:34.700 --> 04:25:36.500
And again, that's our opinion.

04:25:36.500 --> 04:25:40.700
So it's not legal, it's just my opinion.

04:25:40.700 --> 04:25:41.540
Cool.

04:25:41.540 --> 04:25:44.260
And yeah, sorry, I know what you're doing.

04:25:44.260 --> 04:25:48.300
I wasn't, yeah, can we just throw that out there?

04:25:48.300 --> 04:25:50.500
No, no, no, I just want to, sometimes,

04:25:50.500 --> 04:25:52.380
I think it's always better,

04:25:52.380 --> 04:25:53.700
and maybe this is a fault of mine,

04:25:53.700 --> 04:25:55.700
is to be more articulate and clear,

04:25:55.700 --> 04:25:58.100
and to clarify stuff, so that when we walk away,

04:25:58.100 --> 04:26:02.140
we're clear about what the perception was,

04:26:02.140 --> 04:26:04.820
or what the intent was, but not intent to accept.

04:26:04.820 --> 04:26:06.780
I know your intent, yeah, no, I trust your intent,

04:26:06.780 --> 04:26:09.780
absolutely, I do trust your intent, obviously.

04:26:11.260 --> 04:26:13.180
That, yeah, and I hope you trust mine.

04:26:14.940 --> 04:26:16.180
You can do something you can work on,

04:26:16.180 --> 04:26:19.220
if you need me, like I told you before,

04:26:19.220 --> 04:26:20.500
you know, if you can't do anything,

04:26:20.500 --> 04:26:23.580
and I've been through that before with Tim and Jan,

04:26:23.580 --> 04:26:26.340
and when they get stuck on some sort of bureaucratic thing,

04:26:26.340 --> 04:26:29.460
I'm still happy about it, so, appreciate that.

04:26:30.780 --> 04:26:33.340
Good deal, I think we got a good, good work and plan.

04:26:34.340 --> 04:26:36.580
Maybe, I mean, I'll even try to do some research

04:26:36.580 --> 04:26:39.060
on a lawyer for you, and give you some suggestions,

04:26:39.060 --> 04:26:40.260
or something like that, I don't know,

04:26:40.260 --> 04:26:41.380
we'll see what I can do.

04:26:41.380 --> 04:26:44.220
I don't know, just do the same research you can do,

04:26:44.220 --> 04:26:46.700
but at least I can give you a,

04:26:46.700 --> 04:26:48.980
okay, well, this looks good, that doesn't look good,

04:26:48.980 --> 04:26:51.460
but anyway, we'll go for that part first,

04:26:51.460 --> 04:26:52.780
and then if you find anything else,

04:26:52.780 --> 04:26:55.340
then you can tell us who would be good.

04:26:55.340 --> 04:26:58.780
I'll, can you do more specific with help with?

04:26:58.780 --> 04:27:01.060
Yeah, I mean, do you know what I'm doing now?

04:27:01.060 --> 04:27:02.420
Yeah, yeah.

04:27:02.420 --> 04:27:04.060
So, like, today was just to assess

04:27:04.060 --> 04:27:06.940
what kind of access you have, or what kind of skills you have.

04:27:06.940 --> 04:27:08.780
So what I'll do is I'll write this up and ask around,

04:27:08.780 --> 04:27:10.300
like maybe there's someone who might call a crime

04:27:10.300 --> 04:27:12.900
who has, you know, a need for something

04:27:12.900 --> 04:27:14.940
that you can help with, and then I'll find them and say,

04:27:14.940 --> 04:27:15.940
hey, this is what he's got,

04:27:15.940 --> 04:27:18.020
this is the skills he has, this is the access he has.

04:27:18.020 --> 04:27:20.180
That's all based on what we've said today.

04:27:20.180 --> 04:27:21.220
That's why if there's anything else

04:27:21.220 --> 04:27:23.700
that you have access to, or crimes that you're aware of,

04:27:23.700 --> 04:27:25.140
all those things are useful,

04:27:25.140 --> 04:27:27.060
because then we can use that to say,

04:27:27.060 --> 04:27:28.700
okay, this person can use you to this person.

04:27:28.700 --> 04:27:29.540
Oh, okay.

04:27:29.540 --> 04:27:30.380
Does that make sense?

04:27:30.380 --> 04:27:31.220
Yeah, it makes sense.

04:27:31.220 --> 04:27:33.340
Right now, we're just the gatekeepers

04:27:33.340 --> 04:27:35.980
of your information, like, you give us the information,

04:27:35.980 --> 04:27:37.780
we send it out to other bureau people,

04:27:37.780 --> 04:27:39.620
because we can't have 800 people in the room right now.

04:27:39.620 --> 04:27:41.460
Right, right, so it's a placement.

04:27:41.460 --> 04:27:42.300
That's right, okay.

04:27:42.300 --> 04:27:43.140
Okay, yeah.

04:27:43.140 --> 04:27:44.100
That's the whole reason we're here,

04:27:44.100 --> 04:27:46.220
is just to see what you can provide us

04:27:46.220 --> 04:27:48.100
so that we can help you, make sense.

04:27:48.100 --> 04:27:51.700
Okay, I will be putting a list of journalism.

04:27:51.700 --> 04:27:52.540
Right.

04:27:52.900 --> 04:27:54.180
Any questions you can always give?

04:27:54.180 --> 04:27:55.540
Don't get to anybody.

04:27:55.540 --> 04:27:59.660
And I can, I'm not, I can't get anything,

04:27:59.660 --> 04:28:02.140
but I can get a pretty good amount of data.

04:28:03.500 --> 04:28:05.220
And it would be a more specific ask, too.

04:28:05.220 --> 04:28:07.300
We would say, okay, hey, do you know

04:28:07.300 --> 04:28:10.260
next person at the Miami Herald or something like that?

04:28:10.260 --> 04:28:11.500
What do you know about them?

04:28:11.500 --> 04:28:12.340
And that would be someone else,

04:28:12.340 --> 04:28:13.180
but wouldn't it be me?

04:28:13.180 --> 04:28:14.780
Probably someone out of Miami, right?

04:28:14.780 --> 04:28:17.540
So, anyway, we're gonna take all this stuff

04:28:17.540 --> 04:28:20.740
and digest it, hopefully we can help you out at the same time.

04:28:20.740 --> 04:28:21.580
But if you have any questions,

04:28:21.580 --> 04:28:25.140
you can always give me a call or, you know,

04:28:25.140 --> 04:28:28.060
so these guys are in LA, and I'm obviously in Houston,

04:28:28.060 --> 04:28:31.060
but you know, either way, we can help you out, okay?

04:28:31.060 --> 04:28:34.580
Okay, are you not gonna be an LA person?

04:28:34.580 --> 04:28:35.420
No.

04:28:35.420 --> 04:28:36.340
You're gonna be a Houston person.

04:28:36.340 --> 04:28:37.620
I'm a Houston person, okay.

04:28:37.620 --> 04:28:39.500
Yeah, so if anything develops,

04:28:39.500 --> 04:28:41.220
you'll probably be having an idea.

04:28:41.220 --> 04:28:42.900
Yeah, you're okay.

04:28:42.900 --> 04:28:46.620
Okay, so you just came out here to discuss me.

04:28:46.620 --> 04:28:48.620
Cool, man, thank you.

04:28:48.620 --> 04:28:50.180
Glad to, thank you, kind of.

04:28:50.300 --> 04:28:51.900
You can come all the way down there, right?

04:28:51.900 --> 04:28:52.740
Yeah.

04:28:53.740 --> 04:28:55.300
Oh, cool, I hope.

04:28:55.300 --> 04:28:56.860
And I can't fill in there, right?

04:28:56.860 --> 04:28:57.700
Yeah, please don't, yeah.

04:28:57.700 --> 04:28:59.940
Not even that you had a being, or that you...

04:28:59.940 --> 04:29:01.020
You live in Auburn, you know?

04:29:01.020 --> 04:29:01.860
Is she okay?

04:29:01.860 --> 04:29:02.700
Yeah, I don't know.

04:29:02.700 --> 04:29:03.700
Auburn, obviously, knows you being there.

04:29:03.700 --> 04:29:05.740
So, I don't know if I've seen her, but...

04:29:05.740 --> 04:29:06.700
I wouldn't tell her anything,

04:29:06.700 --> 04:29:08.620
but if I were to talk about it,

04:29:08.620 --> 04:29:09.940
or if she's told us...

04:29:09.940 --> 04:29:11.700
You're not even going to talk about it.

04:29:11.700 --> 04:29:13.660
You're not even going to talk about it, I mean...

04:29:13.660 --> 04:29:15.580
I think anyone who's seen me,

04:29:15.580 --> 04:29:17.900
personally, better, I'd be talking to her in 21.

04:29:17.900 --> 04:29:18.740
That'd be great.

04:29:18.740 --> 04:29:21.180
You'd be talking to her in 23.

04:29:21.180 --> 04:29:22.020
Not funny.

04:29:22.020 --> 04:29:23.740
Yeah, I would never hear you talking to her.

04:29:23.740 --> 04:29:24.740
You'd be talking to her all the time.

04:29:24.740 --> 04:29:25.580
I'd play to her.

04:29:25.580 --> 04:29:26.620
No, she'd play to her.

04:29:26.620 --> 04:29:28.020

04:29:28.020 --> 04:29:29.820
Is she around today?

04:29:29.820 --> 04:29:30.780
Yeah.

04:29:30.780 --> 04:29:32.580
I can play by...

04:29:32.580 --> 04:29:33.900
I don't know, I could still talk to her a lot.

04:29:33.900 --> 04:29:35.020
You could play by.

04:29:35.020 --> 04:29:36.460
Talk to her real quick, she'd talk to her.

04:29:36.460 --> 04:29:37.900
You want to come by the class?

04:29:37.900 --> 04:29:39.020
