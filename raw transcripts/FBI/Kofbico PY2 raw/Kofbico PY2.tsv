31000	33000	I don't think I like these jeans.
33000	35000	They're really great.
35000	36000	Yeah, very.
36000	38000	Yeah, especially when we run the run.
38000	40000	Okay.
40000	42000	Thank you, baby.
42000	43000	You're kind of...
43000	44000	Normal guy.

45000	46000	Oh, good.

53000	55000	I don't wear this stuff.
57000	58000	Okay.
58000	59000	Huh?
68000	70000	Oh, my cigarette.

71000	72000	I need that mask.
72000	73000	Okay.

77000	78000	What are you using now?
78000	79000	Uh, later.
79000	81000	Like a small one.
81000	83000	Oh, I think I have one in my bag, actually.
83000	84000	Oh, yeah.
84000	85000	Oh, perfect.
85000	86000	No, no, no. Wait, wait.
86000	87000	This one scares me.
88000	89000	No.
89000	90000	That's not good.
90000	92000	You can put that somewhere else.
94000	95000	One, two, three.
95000	96000	Courage, huh?
96000	98000	Do you want to give me back all the other stuff?
100000	101000	The, um...
101000	102000	The bad greeners?
102000	103000	Yeah.
103000	104000	Do you want that back?
104000	105000	Yeah, this one.
105000	106000	Okay.
107000	108000	Yeah.
108000	109000	I can't do this one.
109000	110000	Okay.
113000	114000	Is it bad?
114000	115000	Yeah.
115000	116000	Yeah.
116000	117000	I can't do this.
117000	118000	I don't know if it's...
118000	119000	It's good.
119000	120000	It's good?
120000	121000	Yeah.
121000	122000	It's beautiful.
122000	123000	Oh, that's beautiful.
123000	124000	You...
124000	126000	I'm gonna picture you in your beauty.
129000	130000	Okay.
130000	131000	Wow.
139000	140000	Okay.
140000	141000	That's all.
141000	142000	That's all.
143000	144000	Um...
144000	146000	Maybe you can meet me if you come downstairs now.
149000	150000	Why don't you go by the building?
150000	151000	Come here.
151000	152000	Come here.
152000	153000	No, no, in front of the building.
154000	155000	Just get in there.
155000	156000	Just...
156000	158000	Just get your best friend in the building, please.
159000	161000	Why are you both doing that with your top?
162000	163000	That would be that, no.
163000	165000	This is not France in 1992.
166000	167000	Both shoulders off.
168000	169000	That's better.
169000	170000	That's what I'm talking about.
172000	173000	What?
175000	177000	I'm telling you to come down and meet me.
178000	180000	See, he's supposed to come down and meet me.
180000	182000	You have to sneak me in, remember?
204000	206000	He's heading down now.
206000	207000	Okay.
211000	213000	So, I'll say Marie wants me...
235000	236000	Do you do well?
236000	237000	Do you need to do well?
238000	239000	Yes, I do.
240000	242000	I'm saying you just want to briefly meet him and say hi.
242000	243000	Sure.
243000	244000	Okay.
244000	245000	Sure.
245000	246000	I'll miss you.
246000	247000	We'll keep you.
247000	249000	You want me to put some of this on this guy?
250000	251000	Yeah.
260000	262000	He's covered in this.
264000	265000	Okay.
270000	272000	I'm going to tell him we're outside in the parking lot.
274000	276000	You said it's cool to meet him, you can meet him.
276000	278000	We're outside in the parking lot.
281000	282000	Drop off your air.
283000	284000	Yeah, too.
285000	286000	Drop off your air.
288000	290000	Red Mini, you can't do this here.
291000	292000	Where is it?
293000	294000	Here.
294000	295000	What's up?
295000	296000	Okay.
296000	297000	Where is that?
297000	298000	I'm worried.
298000	299000	Aw, thank you.
299000	300000	Perfect.
300000	301000	Oh, yes.
301000	302000	Good idea, baby.
302000	303000	What?
303000	304000	That's a good one.
304000	305000	I like the pie.
305000	306000	Nice.
306000	307000	Okay.
307000	309000	You're not switching too much.
309000	310000	I am so hot.
311000	313000	There will be air con inside.
316000	317000	My story.
318000	321000	It's a cool thing because it's like an internet joint.
321000	322000	Yeah?
323000	324000	Look.
324000	325000	Super elegant.
325000	327000	You look super cool.
327000	328000	Super stylish.
329000	330000	Super fashionable.
330000	331000	I like it.
332000	333000	I need you.
333000	334000	It's the best thing.
334000	335000	Not as bad as me.
335000	337000	Do you want one of these or do you have another one?
339000	340000	Yes, good.
340000	341000	Well done.
341000	342000	Perfect.
342000	343000	Good, good, good.
343000	344000	That's what I'm talking about.
345000	346000	Smart.
346000	347000	See you again.
347000	348000	Thank you so much.
348000	349000	Thank you.
349000	350000	I'll give myself a bit.
350000	351000	Pipe.
351000	352000	That's what you can't use.
352000	354000	You have a band on your arm.
354000	355000	Is it your boyfriend?
355000	356000	Is it your husband?
357000	358000	Is it your boyfriend?
358000	359000	No, no, no.
359000	360000	Is it your controlling boyfriend?
362000	363000	They looked at me.
363000	364000	They were like...
364000	365000	Who?
365000	366000	Nothing.
366000	367000	What was the thing?
367000	368000	You have a band.
368000	369000	I just...
369000	370000	I did not know what it was to me.
370000	371000	Look, what did they...
371000	372000	Is it like...
372000	373000	No, I was cooking and...
373000	374000	They mean anything about it?
374000	375000	No, no.
375000	377000	They just looked at me and looked at me and looked at me.
377000	378000	Okay.
380000	381000	Hello.
382000	383000	How's my hair?
383000	384000	It's okay.
384000	385000	What's it?
385000	386000	It's okay.
386000	387000	Don't worry about it.
387000	389000	It just makes my hair look a little stupid.
389000	390000	It's okay.
390000	391000	It's weird.
391000	392000	It's okay?
392000	393000	We need some sun.
393000	394000	I know.
395000	396000	We need some sunglasses.
396000	398000	Oh my God, yeah.
399000	400000	Maybe we can do that today.
400000	402000	Oh, can you make appointments at the Apple Store for us?
402000	403000	Soon after your...
403000	405000	Your thing, we can go directly to the Apple Store.
405000	407000	You get a new pair of glasses.
407000	409000	We can go directly to the Apple Store.
409000	410000	You get a new phone.
410000	412000	So we're not being hacked by everybody.
412000	414000	Yes, you do, because you're hacked by everybody.
416000	417000	Okay.
417000	418000	No, but in your ear.
418000	419000	Oh, yeah?
419000	420000	Did you get them?
420000	421000	I don't...
423000	424000	I'm sorry.
424000	425000	What are you doing?
425000	426000	No, but they're in there.
426000	427000	Oh, okay.
427000	428000	I know, it's annoying, but...
428000	429000	Not helpful.
430000	431000	It's really loud.
433000	435000	It's really, really super loud, baby.
435000	436000	I'm sorry.
436000	438000	You just can't blow my ears like that.
439000	441000	All right, so where are the plans today?
443000	444000	Today's plans.
444000	445000	Okay.
445000	446000	You're gonna do this.
446000	447000	Y'all on goes.
447000	448000	You might pick me up.
448000	449000	You might not.
449000	451000	So I'll take Uber and then go to...
452000	453000	Oh, shit.
454000	455000	Oh, no.
455000	456000	I left it inside.
457000	458000	Yeah, I need my keys.
461000	462000	Oh, there's the Fanta.
462000	463000	The pineapple Fanta?
463000	464000	Yeah.
464000	465000	Ah.
465000	466000	Wonderful.
466000	467000	Thank you.
467000	468000	Perfect.
469000	470000	Oh, no.
475000	476000	One, two, three.
476000	477000	I got it.
478000	479000	Do you have to go?
479000	480000	Yeah, well, he's gonna come.
480000	481000	All right?
481000	482000	I told him Red Mini, you can't miss us.
482000	483000	Good night.
483000	484000	Yeah, just leave it here.
484000	485000	Yeah.
485000	486000	Put on the hazards.
486000	487000	Put the hazards on.
488000	489000	Nice.
489000	490000	Lock it, yeah.
491000	492000	Mr. Reed.
493000	494000	Mr. Reed.
495000	496000	Mr. Reed.
497000	498000	Hello, Mr. Reed.
498000	500000	There are four lights.
501000	502000	Do you have the lights on?
502000	503000	Yeah.
504000	505000	Yeah, running.
506000	507000	It's going right now.
509000	510000	What about this back?
510000	511000	See the back?
511000	512000	It sticks out?
512000	513000	I don't have the key.
513000	514000	No.
514000	515000	I don't have the key back.
516000	517000	I don't have the key.
517000	518000	I don't have the key.
518000	519000	Are you sure?
519000	520000	I don't know.
520000	521000	I don't know.
521000	522000	You can fix that.
523000	524000	You did great.
524000	525000	You did great.
525000	526000	Oh, here we are.
527000	528000	Hello.
528000	529000	Hey.
529000	530000	It's Daniel.
530000	531000	David.
531000	532000	David Koh.
532000	533000	Nice to meet you.
533000	534000	Cheers.
534000	535000	This is Mary High.
535000	536000	I'm sorry?
536000	537000	I'm sorry.
537000	538000	Oh, good play.
538000	539000	All right, Bo.
539000	540000	Nice to meet you.
540000	541000	Yeah, good to be here.
541000	542000	I'm sorry.
542000	543000	I'm sorry.
543000	544000	Remember I spoke the other night?
544000	545000	Yeah.
545000	546000	It's all right?
546000	547000	It's all right.
547000	548000	It's all right.
548000	551000	She almost killed me like five times getting here.
551000	554000	She's French and a woman.
554000	556000	She's got two cliches against her.
556000	557000	French and a woman.
557000	559000	Well, there's your first go.
559000	560000	Enjoy.
560000	561000	Enjoy.
561000	562000	I got it.
562000	563000	I got it.
563000	564000	Oh, careful.
564000	566000	Remember to shake on my back.
566000	567000	Thank you.
567000	568000	All right, guys.
568000	569000	Thanks.
569000	570000	How's it going?
570000	571000	Good, good.
571000	572000	Boeing.
572000	573000	Is that your name, is that it?
573000	574000	Yeah.
574000	575000	Like the...
575000	576000	Oh, where's my mask?
576000	577000	Yeah.
577000	578000	The company, right?
578000	579000	Yeah.
579000	580000	Look at it.
580000	581000	Do your parents...
581000	583000	Is that the one staff that comes down?
583000	584000	Oh, my God.
584000	586000	There was some, but not for LA.
586000	587000	Okay.
587000	588000	Really weird.
588000	589000	So easy.
589000	590000	Cool.
590000	591000	Yeah.
591000	592000	Yeah, it was part of our strategy.
592000	593000	Lightened up a little bit.
593000	594000	Sorry I'm late, though.
594000	595000	Oh, come on.
595000	596000	It's like LA.
596000	597000	You're from here.
597000	598000	It's...
598000	599000	You're not from here.
599000	600000	No, no, no.
600000	601000	Not me.
601000	602000	Not from here.
602000	603000	We're going to get you a visitor, guys.
603000	604000	What?
604000	605000	Is there a visitor?
605000	606000	Come on in, sir.
606000	607000	I have a photo of it.
607000	612000	I need a physical ID, unless you guys are okay with that.
612000	616000	This is actually my fault because I lost my drugs license a few days ago.
616000	617000	I don't know where it is.
617000	618000	It's in a bookshelf.
618000	619000	It's on my bookshelf.
619000	620000	It's okay.
620000	621000	You guys are okay with that?
621000	622000	Okay.
622000	623000	Just go ahead and place all your items here in the bin for me.
623000	624000	Okay.
624000	626000	Okay, now do you want to let you know you were entering the federal facility?
626000	627000	Okay, we are conducting.
627000	628000	Sir, one second.
628000	629000	Okay, listen to me.
629000	631000	I'm not done with this inspection, okay?
631000	632000	Okay.
632000	633000	We are inspecting for weapons and explosives.
633000	634000	You have nothing like that on you?
634000	635000	No, I don't.
635000	640000	You can still carry any tools, knives, pepper spray, nothing like that?
640000	641000	Okay.
641000	642000	Let's do your belt off.
642000	643000	Oh, great.
643000	644000	Okay.
644000	645000	I'm going to have you take off your coat.
645000	646000	Sure.
646000	647000	Sure.
647000	648000	No problem.
648000	653000	You guys, what are you doing?
653000	656000	Do you have any electronics?
656000	657000	Okay.
657000	658000	No, they're all in here.
658000	659000	Okay, put them separately, boss.
659000	660000	Separately from your bag.
660000	661000	Okay.
661000	662000	You can put them right here with your document.
662000	663000	Put your document here.
663000	664000	Put your document right there, okay?
664000	665000	Okay.
665000	666000	I'll leave them in the bag.
666000	667000	You want to take them out of there?
667000	668000	Take them out of there.
668000	669000	Okay.
669000	670000	I brought some stuff.
670000	671000	He said don't bring anything.
671000	672000	I thought you marked it.
672000	673000	I thought you were just being polite.
673000	674000	I brought a little stuff for you.
674000	675000	Okay.
675000	676000	Okay.
676000	677000	Okay.
677000	678000	And nothing else on you?
678000	679000	Nope.
679000	680000	Okay.
680000	681000	Just go ahead and...
681000	682000	Oh, wait.
682000	683000	I don't mean anything.
683000	684000	Yeah, everything out of your pocket.
684000	685000	Okay?
685000	686000	Okay.
686000	688000	So you have nothing with your name on it?
688000	689000	I do.
689000	690000	Okay.
690000	691000	But I'll show it to you on my phone.
691000	693000	I'm going to have my wallet full of cards.
693000	694000	Oh, okay.
694000	696000	Just hang on to it for now, okay?
696000	697000	That's fine.
697000	698000	Stand right over there, okay?
698000	699000	Give me one second.
699000	706000	One second.
706000	721000	I didn't know how to play dirty support.
721000	722000	Okay.
722000	723000	Go ahead and walk through, sir.
723000	724000	Straight through, okay?
724000	725000	Okay.
725000	726000	There we go.
726000	727000	Okay.
727000	729000	You said you have a picture of your ID or something like that?
729000	730000	Yes, I do.
730000	731000	Okay.
731000	732000	I'm going to give you...
732000	733000	Just my recessions.
733000	734000	I want to see that because they can make you a badge.
734000	735000	Of course, sir.
735000	736000	Here's my phone.
736000	737000	Okay.
737000	738000	Give it to the receptionist.
738000	739000	Oh, wait.
739000	740000	They're going to want my phone.
740000	741000	Okay.
741000	742000	Give it to the receptionist.
742000	743000	Okay.
743000	744000	Give it to the receptionist.
744000	745000	Oh, wait.
745000	746000	They're going to want my phone.
746000	747000	Okay.
747000	748000	Okay.
748000	749000	Give it to the receptionist.
749000	750000	Oh, wait.
750000	751000	They're going to want my phone.
751000	752000	Okay.
752000	753000	Okay.
753000	754000	What are the rules for the mask?
754000	755000	Keep it on.
755000	756000	All times?
756000	757000	Sure.
757000	758000	Okay.
758000	759000	Okay.
759000	785000	Ma'am, thank you for following me.
785000	795000	It's much, much, much easier than it was last time I was here.
795000	796000	Sorry?
796000	797000	This is me.
797000	798000	It's new, huh?
798000	799000	Yeah.
799000	800000	That's why.
800000	803000	This used to be called a coffee.
803000	804000	Oh, yeah.
804000	806000	And there's a guy selling coffee over here, too.
806000	807000	Right?
807000	808000	Yeah.
808000	810000	If that doesn't, I'm not going to go.
810000	811000	Anyway.
811000	812000	Yeah, okay.
812000	814000	Is there still coffee inside?
814000	815000	No.
815000	816000	Oh, do you need coffee?
816000	817000	I'm going to get some coffee.
817000	818000	Yeah.
818000	821000	I don't have to go through all this again, do I?
821000	822000	No.
822000	823000	Okay.
823000	824000	You guys want anything?
824000	825000	Oh, I'm good.
825000	826000	Okay.
826000	827000	No?
827000	828000	Okay.
828000	829000	Um, coffee.
829000	830000	Yeah.
830000	831000	Sorry.
831000	832000	Just, you know.
832000	833000	Do you need it on your bag?
833000	834000	I like that.
834000	835000	Yeah.
835000	836000	It's a gift from Marie.
836000	837000	Oh, cool.
837000	838000	Yeah.
838000	839000	She's a good friend.
839000	840000	Yeah.
840000	841000	She's a good friend.
841000	842000	Yeah.
842000	843000	Yeah.
843000	846000	She's, uh – she's learning.
846000	848000	She's very jealous.
848000	850000	Really wanting to come and hang out with you guys.
850000	851000	Oh, yeah.
851000	852000	She's so married.
852000	854000	She's like, but I speak eight languages.
854000	855000	You know?
855000	856000	Eight.
856000	858000	Which languages?
858000	862000	Oh, uh, uh, English, I know, right?
862000	867000	English, Swiss, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian.
867000	868000	Huh?
868000	870000	And I think she – uh, Chinese.
870000	876000	I apologize, I think because of like Chinese pandemic stuff, usually they're coming here.
876000	880000	Oh, oh really? In the break room upstairs to the floor?
880000	881000	Yeah, you know what there is.
881000	883000	Oh, perfect, okay.
884000	885000	Good morning gentlemen.
885000	889000	Good morning. We have a visitor here, and he's from...
890000	891000	Thank you.
894000	895000	Cheers.
895000	896000	Can you see my partner?
896000	897000	Thanks.
898000	899000	You guys want to do this again?
899000	900000	Oh, okay.
900000	901000	Thank you.
901000	902000	Thank you.
908000	909000	Cool.
912000	914000	Does everyone make fun?
914000	915000	Um...
915000	916000	Really, huh?
916000	920000	Yeah, usually you'll feel comfortable here because of your game console.
920000	921000	Oh, dang it.
921000	926000	You know, I get to meet about a fun man or two different people.
928000	930000	I remember this tent floor.
930000	932000	I handed my stuff, we go to another one over there.
932000	934000	Exactly, same thing.
934000	938000	And then what we just handled over there used to be handled on a tent floor.
938000	939000	Yeah.
939000	940000	Yeah.
940000	942000	So that girl's no longer working here?
942000	943000	It's a floor lady?
943000	944000	Oh, it's always changing.
944000	945000	She's so nice.
945000	946000	Super nice.
946000	947000	Oh, that could be it.
948000	949000	Yeah.
951000	952000	Still not.
952000	953000	Are you guys there?
953000	955000	So, some of you are special agents?
955000	956000	Yep.
956000	957000	And you are DC3?
958000	959000	Uh, I'm not...
959000	960000	I'm not...
960000	962000	You know, I'm not part of their...
962000	963000	Oh, no.
963000	964000	Their hierarchy.
964000	965000	No, I'm not.
965000	966000	It's not the...
966000	968000	It's the general hierarchy.
968000	969000	In New York.
969000	970000	It's everything but Russia.
971000	972000	DC3.
972000	974000	Yeah, so it usually doesn't work in the same way.
974000	975000	Oh.
975000	976000	Yeah.
976000	977000	So different...
977000	979000	Different to a lot of different things.
980000	981000	Cool.
981000	982000	Oh, there.
982000	983000	I see what you're saying.
983000	984000	Yeah.
984000	985000	Yeah, yeah.
985000	986000	You remember that?
986000	987000	I do.
988000	989000	Oh, wait.
991000	993000	It's my natural that's supposed to...
993000	994000	Oh, right.
996000	997000	Thanks.
998000	999000	Okay.
1001000	1003000	What's going to do with it?
1004000	1006000	I wonder if we're all thoroughly...
1006000	1008000	What's going on?
1011000	1013000	Did you get a chance to...
1013000	1014000	There were four lights.
1014000	1015000	Clever.
1015000	1016000	I liked it.
1016000	1017000	I liked it.
1017000	1018000	I'd love you to get the reference.
1018000	1019000	Oh, I got it.
1019000	1020000	I got it.
1020000	1021000	That's what it is.
1021000	1023000	That's supposed to make a random number.
1023000	1024000	Yeah, that's good.
1024000	1026000	One, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.
1026000	1028000	I was surprised you spelled out four, though.
1028000	1029000	Oh, I think...
1029000	1031000	Because I never thought we'd take anything.
1031000	1032000	Oh, it was?
1032000	1033000	Oh, okay.
1033000	1034000	Yeah, that's how it is.
1034000	1035000	It's good.
1035000	1037000	Well, you read the call of Winston.
1037000	1038000	It's from Winston.
1038000	1039000	And he's being tortured.
1039000	1040000	Right.
1040000	1041000	Writing in the floor.
1041000	1043000	It's a portless floor.
1043000	1044000	A two-plus-two-plus-four.
1044000	1045000	Interesting.
1045000	1046000	No.
1046000	1048000	That's the one where there are five lights.
1048000	1051000	And he makes cards saying that there are four.
1051000	1052000	Oh, no.
1052000	1054000	He makes them say that there are five lights.
1054000	1055000	I know, but that's...
1055000	1057000	But it's taken from 1984?
1057000	1058000	Yes.
1058000	1060000	Right after the record.
1060000	1062000	Right after the record.
1066000	1067000	Nice.
1074000	1075000	Cool.
1077000	1079000	He probably grabbed all the stuff.
1079000	1080000	Okay.
1082000	1083000	Is there another room?
1083000	1084000	Yeah.
1084000	1086000	I think I might have a bigger...
1086000	1087000	No, it's okay.
1087000	1089000	I like the other side of the room.
1090000	1091000	Sorry, this side.
1092000	1093000	That's a big one.
1093000	1094000	It's gonna be good.
1094000	1095000	Hang on there.
1098000	1099000	I don't...
1113000	1114000	Cool.
1114000	1115000	Well, this is...
1115000	1116000	This is Thailand.
1116000	1117000	Thailand?
1117000	1118000	How do you do it?
1118000	1119000	Nice to meet you.
1119000	1120000	Can I take a hand?
1120000	1121000	Yeah, I know, it's a...
1121000	1122000	The virtual way, right?
1122000	1123000	Sure, sure.
1123000	1125000	Patty, are you from Houston as well?
1125000	1126000	No.
1126000	1127000	LA?
1127000	1128000	It's from LA.
1128000	1129000	Okay.
1129000	1130000	Do you like your coffee?
1130000	1131000	Lots of milk sugar.
1131000	1132000	Milk sugar?
1132000	1133000	Yes, please.
1133000	1135000	Can I take off my mask?
1135000	1136000	Good.
1136000	1137000	We casual here?
1137000	1138000	Okay.
1138000	1139000	I have one.
1140000	1141000	Take it really.
1143000	1145000	I just can't get the frogs up my glasses.
1145000	1146000	Yeah.
1146000	1148000	You do it with your fogger.
1148000	1149000	I know.
1149000	1150000	You know?
1150000	1152000	I've got some people with a mask.
1152000	1153000	Oh, yeah.
1153000	1154000	I've got a clear one.
1154000	1155000	Yeah, like a face shield.
1155000	1156000	Yeah.
1156000	1157000	But now they're saying,
1157000	1158000	oh, are you in the mask?
1158000	1159000	Yeah, I think so.
1159000	1160000	Right, right.
1160000	1161000	It's very, really.
1161000	1163000	Do you need both of them?
1163000	1164000	I don't know.
1164000	1165000	There are some.
1165000	1166000	There are some.
1166000	1167000	Yeah, that's a lot.
1167000	1168000	I can't wait for the last time.
1168000	1169000	I'm just gonna leave this.
1170000	1171000	Believe it or not,
1171000	1173000	Russia just did the other vaccine yesterday.
1173000	1174000	Of course they did.
1174000	1175000	I saw that.
1175000	1176000	I saw that too, right?
1177000	1178000	It's propaganda.
1179000	1180000	It's propaganda.
1182000	1183000	Oh, I'm sure.
1183000	1184000	I saw that too.
1184000	1185000	Thank you.
1186000	1187000	Good to care.
1188000	1190000	So I'm so excited to hear what this is about.
1190000	1191000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1191000	1193000	I don't think I can take it anymore.
1193000	1194000	It's like so thrilling.
1194000	1195000	I've got four guesses.
1195000	1196000	Can I guess?
1196000	1197000	Sure, you can guess it.
1197000	1198000	Okay.
1198000	1199000	Does it have to do...
1199000	1200000	I don't think it has to do with things.
1200000	1201000	It probably doesn't have to tell you.
1201000	1202000	It doesn't make you feel like that.
1202000	1203000	No, I'm just gonna double.
1203000	1205000	All right, let me see if I can read you.
1205000	1206000	Based on my guesses.
1207000	1209000	I don't think it's related to banking.
1210000	1211000	Okay.
1211000	1212000	Okay.
1212000	1213000	I think it's related to hacking.
1213000	1214000	Okay.
1214000	1216000	I think it has something to do with Emma.
1216000	1217000	Okay.
1217000	1218000	How am I?
1218000	1219000	I'm close?
1220000	1221000	I couldn't read you.
1222000	1224000	Well, no, you're getting a different one the first time.
1224000	1225000	Your eyes went to the right.
1226000	1227000	Usually, eyes up to the right,
1227000	1228000	you're creating something.
1228000	1230000	Down to the left, it acts as a memory.
1230000	1233000	So, everything I've read and studied about that
1233000	1234000	is actually co-pulsion.
1234000	1235000	It is co-pulsion.
1235000	1236000	You've got to know the person who does that.
1236000	1237000	It is true.
1237000	1238000	You've got to get a baseline with the person first.
1238000	1239000	Whatever.
1239000	1240000	It's not like global.
1240000	1241000	Because you think about it,
1241000	1242000	if that was true.
1242000	1243000	Yeah.
1243000	1244000	Every co-returnment,
1244000	1245000	you'd be able to find out immediately
1245000	1246000	who's blocking the business.
1246000	1247000	That's true.
1247000	1248000	That's true.
1248000	1249000	Because detection of deception
1249000	1251000	is incredibly difficult, unfortunately.
1251000	1253000	Well, do you think so?
1254000	1255000	I think it's pretty easy.
1255000	1257000	It's a research issue.
1257000	1259000	If you know how you are deceptive,
1259000	1261000	then you will know how someone else is deceptive.
1261000	1263000	Except for certain type.
1263000	1264000	I would have to see.
1264000	1265000	Lisa?
1265000	1266000	So, there's different types of liars, too.
1266000	1267000	There's Machiavellian liars,
1267000	1269000	who will lie just a lot.
1269000	1271000	They'll lie because that's just what they did
1271000	1272000	every single day of their life.
1272000	1273000	Trump.
1273000	1274000	Then, on the other side of the world,
1274000	1278000	there's what you can call the Catholic school
1278000	1279000	boy or girl.
1279000	1282000	They've grown up with a fear of lying,
1282000	1283000	where anytime they lie,
1283000	1284000	they're like,
1284000	1285000	I just said that my name is David.
1285000	1287000	What does he think my name is?
1287000	1288000	The shame associated with guilt.
1288000	1290000	So, those are, yeah, exactly.
1290000	1293000	So, those are two very distinctly different types of liars
1293000	1295000	who lie very distinctly different.
1295000	1298000	So, for example, the Machiavellian liars
1298000	1299000	is harder to detect on the line.
1299000	1300000	Because it's constant lines.
1300000	1301000	There's no baseline.
1301000	1304000	And the opposite would be the Catholic school boy or girl
1304000	1308000	is harder to detect because they're constantly triggering.
1308000	1310000	Well, they honestly think that they're lying about something
1310000	1311000	even when they're not.
1311000	1313000	What about the sort of desperate liars
1313000	1315000	that are trying to stay alive?
1316000	1317000	Yeah, I mean, there's a lot.
1317000	1318000	That's what it means.
1318000	1319000	I've read a couple books on it,
1319000	1320000	and we've taken a couple classes.
1320000	1322000	Yeah, that's what I was curious about in your classes.
1322000	1323000	Do they teach that?
1323000	1326000	Do they teach a chronicle or something?
1326000	1328000	Like, that's a thing that I'm sure
1328000	1330000	can be used to see someone's life
1330000	1332000	and there are things that we'll do.
1332000	1334000	And there's things that I do
1334000	1336000	as part of my normal daily life.
1336000	1337000	Yeah.
1337000	1338000	Well, what I do is I ask you questions.
1338000	1340000	I know you'll post your name
1340000	1341000	when it's your birthday,
1341000	1342000	because they're at low.
1342000	1343000	No.
1343000	1345000	And then I'll see how you react to the honest question.
1345000	1347000	And then I'll ask you something I know you don't know,
1347000	1348000	and I'll see how you react to that.
1348000	1350000	And that's how I establish a baseline.
1350000	1351000	That's my method, though.
1351000	1352000	That's a good thing.
1352000	1353000	That's how I do it.
1353000	1354000	What about you?
1354000	1355000	You have polygraph, huh?
1355000	1356000	What's a polygraph?
1356000	1357000	No, no, I'm not.
1357000	1358000	I'm not.
1358000	1359000	I'm never taking polygraph.
1359000	1360000	I would like to if you guys weren't helping out.
1360000	1361000	It'd be fun.
1361000	1363000	But no, I just, you know,
1363000	1365000	I like people.
1365000	1367000	Well, actually, I hate people, but I like...
1370000	1372000	I love and I hate people,
1372000	1373000	but I like to study things.
1373000	1374000	I don't know.
1374000	1375000	Very cool.
1375000	1376000	Very cool.
1376000	1377000	That was nice of you,
1377000	1378000	we're going to bring you down here.
1378000	1379000	Yeah.
1379000	1380000	I guess you can call me
1380000	1381000	if you want to head back out or something.
1381000	1382000	I'm sorry?
1382000	1383000	Do you have to give her a call?
1383000	1384000	No, it's just got to work at one.
1384000	1385000	So she said,
1385000	1386000	is you going to go out
1386000	1387000	and just to write this letter
1387000	1388000	into the judge?
1388000	1389000	Yeah.
1389000	1391000	Well, he got screwed over by his fucking lawyer.
1391000	1393000	It's got to be Mike Kretzmer.
1393000	1394000	Mm-hmm.
1394000	1396000	He went so far as to...
1396000	1398000	He emailed Jim and Tammy
1398000	1399000	saying,
1399000	1400000	I am Val's counsel.
1400000	1401000	I am Val's attorney.
1401000	1402000	I'm Val's attorney.
1402000	1403000	I'm Val's attorney.
1403000	1404000	Interesting.
1404000	1406000	Yeah, because I saw your text this morning.
1406000	1407000	I saw that.
1407000	1409000	You know, he said he'd like to represent you,
1409000	1410000	but he's not, so...
1410000	1411000	Yeah, we had to fire him.
1411000	1412000	Yeah.
1412000	1414000	He was very condescending.
1414000	1416000	And there's something really wrong.
1416000	1418000	You see, I thought it was in L.A.
1418000	1420000	I mean, it's like a mafia.
1420000	1421000	They know each other
1421000	1422000	and they do whatever
1422000	1423000	the other person says.
1423000	1424000	It's very disturbing.
1424000	1425000	They want to mess it up however you want,
1425000	1426000	but you have to have it.
1426000	1427000	That's perfect.
1427000	1428000	Thank you.
1428000	1429000	Wonderful.
1432000	1433000	All right.
1433000	1435000	Well, I tried to guess what this is all about.
1435000	1436000	It says,
1436000	1437000	nothing to do with banking.
1437000	1438000	Okay.
1438000	1440000	And I think that's something to do with hacking.
1440000	1442000	And the name is Emma.
1442000	1443000	Oh, look.
1443000	1445000	I think I got the honor of being here.
1445000	1446000	You know what I mean?
1446000	1447000	You know what I mean?
1447000	1448000	You know what I mean?
1448000	1449000	Well, I mean, to the third guest.
1449000	1450000	Okay.
1450000	1451000	No, no, no.
1451000	1452000	Another guest.
1452000	1453000	Interesting.
1456000	1458000	Who's the third guest?
1458000	1459000	I think he's the fourth guest.
1459000	1460000	No, no, no.
1461000	1462000	Okay.
1462000	1463000	Yes.
1463000	1464000	Oh, there's a guest.
1464000	1465000	It's a match.
1465000	1466000	It's a match.
1466000	1467000	It's a problem.
1467000	1468000	Cool.
1468000	1470000	I guess, so,
1470000	1472000	what we're here for is mainly to see
1472000	1473000	how we can help you, right?
1473000	1475000	Because we need to find out.
1475000	1476000	So, you and I have talked,
1476000	1478000	I've talked with Patty and Bowling
1478000	1479000	about it lately,
1479000	1480000	but you should probably
1480000	1481000	re-match a little bit about
1481000	1483000	what the situation is right now,
1483000	1484000	how the hearing went,
1484000	1485000	and everything else.
1485000	1487000	Just make sure that we're all on the same page.
1487000	1488000	Because like I told you,
1488000	1491000	like, if we are going to be able to help,
1491000	1493000	we have to know how we can help
1493000	1494000	and how best to help you.
1494000	1495000	Okay.
1495000	1496000	That way, we can go forward.
1496000	1497000	But at the same time,
1497000	1498000	if you're going to help us,
1498000	1499000	you also have to know,
1499000	1500000	okay, well, is this going to be
1500000	1501000	dependent on something else?
1501000	1502000	Right.
1502000	1503000	Well, that's why,
1503000	1504000	why don't you just tell me
1504000	1505000	first what you want.
1505000	1506000	And then I'll go from there.
1506000	1507000	Well, I mean,
1507000	1508000	the thing is like,
1508000	1509000	I'm not going to tell you
1509000	1510000	what exactly we want.
1510000	1511000	I'm telling you that right now.
1511000	1512000	I've already told you,
1512000	1513000	on the phone,
1513000	1514000	I'm giving you my word,
1514000	1516000	because you, Tim and Jami,
1516000	1517000	recommended you.
1517000	1518000	I said,
1518000	1519000	I'll help you if you need my help.
1519000	1520000	No matter what.
1520000	1521000	Even if it's,
1521000	1523000	even if it's not anything related
1523000	1524000	to you helping me,
1524000	1525000	I will help you the best
1525000	1526000	in my ability.
1526000	1527000	Okay.
1527000	1528000	Just because of Tim and Jami,
1528000	1529000	because I date,
1529000	1530000	their word is very,
1530000	1531000	they carry a lot with me.
1531000	1532000	It goes far with me.
1532000	1533000	So I've already told you that,
1533000	1534000	so I'll stick with that.
1534000	1535000	You don't have to worry about
1535000	1536000	anything too transactional with me
1536000	1537000	right now.
1537000	1538000	Okay.
1538000	1539000	If you guys are coming out here
1539000	1540000	to help me,
1540000	1541000	that's great.
1541000	1542000	Okay.
1542000	1543000	I'll tell you,
1543000	1544000	what do you need to know?
1544000	1545000	The whole story from the beginning?
1545000	1546000	Yep.
1546000	1547000	Different deal.
1547000	1548000	Okay.
1548000	1549000	Go.
1549000	1550000	Um.
1550000	1551000	Um.
1551000	1552000	I don't even know where to start
1552000	1553000	from the beginning.
1553000	1554000	Uh.
1554000	1555000	Okay.
1555000	1556000	So,
1556000	1557000	you don't know my story though.
1557000	1558000	It doesn't really matter, does it?
1558000	1559000	Um.
1559000	1560000	You can't even trust it.
1560000	1561000	You can't even trust it.
1561000	1562000	Oh, please don't read it.
1562000	1563000	David Ennerinches article.
1563000	1564000	It's terrible.
1564000	1565000	Um.
1565000	1566000	Okay.
1566000	1567000	So Marie and I,
1567000	1568000	I'm that,
1568000	1569000	you know,
1569000	1570000	you can't even trust it.
1570000	1571000	You can't even trust it.
1571000	1572000	You can't even trust it.
1572000	1573000	You can't even trust it.
1573000	1574000	Marie and I met,
1574000	1575000	uh,
1575000	1577000	because I thought she was a spy for my mom,
1577000	1579000	and I thought she was spying on me.
1579000	1580000	So I,
1580000	1581000	uh,
1581000	1583000	confronted her,
1583000	1584000	and she was,
1584000	1585000	uh,
1585000	1586000	had a show in Australia
1586000	1587000	doing,
1587000	1588000	selling a bunch of,
1588000	1589000	uh,
1589000	1590000	she had a personal,
1590000	1592000	like her first cool show in Adeline,
1592000	1593000	I think,
1593000	1594000	with her,
1594000	1595000	Sydney.
1595000	1596000	I don't remember.
1596000	1597000	So,
1597000	1598000	um,
1598000	1599000	she ends up,
1599000	1600000	she knows my mother,
1600000	1601000	because my mother,
1601000	1602000	um,
1602000	1604000	she know that story, right?
1604000	1605000	So he killed himself,
1605000	1607000	and my mother needs something to do,
1607000	1608000	after she,
1608000	1609000	uh,
1609000	1610000	robbed me and everyone else in the family
1610000	1611000	of all our money.
1611000	1612000	Um,
1612000	1613000	went to,
1613000	1614000	back to,
1614000	1615000	uh, art school in New York,
1615000	1616000	and,
1616000	1617000	uh,
1617000	1618000	Marie was just about to leave her husband,
1618000	1620000	and she went to art school in New York at the same time.
1620000	1622000	So my mom's like 64,
1622000	1624000	Marie was like 34 at the same time,
1624000	1625000	but they hit it off,
1625000	1626000	became friends.
1626000	1627000	You know,
1627000	1629000	Marie actually stayed on my mom's house,
1629000	1630000	she knows my sisters,
1630000	1631000	she did like cocaine with my mother,
1631000	1632000	which is weird.
1632000	1634000	You could imagine,
1634000	1635000	with stories,
1635000	1636000	it's very weird.
1636000	1637000	Um,
1637000	1638000	anyway,
1638000	1639000	so,
1639000	1640000	and not to incriminate me.
1640000	1641000	It's a joke,
1641000	1642000	you guys say.
1642000	1643000	Having coffee with friends.
1643000	1644000	Right, right.
1644000	1645000	So,
1645000	1646000	um,
1646000	1647000	and then we hit it off,
1647000	1648000	and she came back to LA,
1648000	1649000	and she lived in LA fortunately,
1649000	1650000	and,
1650000	1651000	uh,
1651000	1652000	and David needed somebody to,
1652000	1653000	um,
1653000	1655000	and my mother's side was not talking,
1655000	1656000	and at this point,
1656000	1657000	I was still friends with David,
1657000	1658000	David Unridge,
1658000	1660000	and he is someone on my mom's count,
1660000	1661000	and so I said,
1661000	1662000	you know what,
1662000	1663000	I think I got the perfect person,
1663000	1664000	I'm gonna,
1664000	1665000	I'm gonna flip her,
1665000	1666000	and take her from my mom's side,
1666000	1667000	bring her to our side,
1667000	1668000	it's a good side of the force,
1668000	1669000	right,
1669000	1670000	and I did,
1670000	1671000	you know,
1671000	1672000	and I did,
1672000	1673000	and she became a source of the book,
1673000	1674000	and she told David
1674000	1675000	all the blanks he,
1675000	1676000	uh,
1676000	1677000	was missing,
1677000	1679000	and we moved in together,
1679000	1680000	you know,
1680000	1681000	all my life,
1681000	1682000	I've been like a bachelor,
1682000	1683000	you know,
1683000	1684000	kind of spoiled brat,
1684000	1685000	mostly too,
1685000	1686000	and my dad,
1686000	1687000	kind of financed my life,
1687000	1688000	so I,
1688000	1689000	I made music,
1689000	1691000	I had 36 albums in a single,
1691000	1692000	I had a lot of girlfriends,
1692000	1693000	I fucked around,
1693000	1694000	I went on tour,
1694000	1695000	I had fun,
1695000	1696000	you know,
1696000	1697000	and that all,
1697000	1698000	went to zero,
1698000	1699000	and it all stopped,
1699000	1700000	immediately,
1700000	1701000	and January 26, 2014,
1701000	1702000	and I learned,
1702000	1703000	I learned a lot since then,
1703000	1705000	a lot of things have changed for me,
1705000	1707000	and I've never dated a girl
1707000	1708000	with a kid,
1708000	1709000	and I was like,
1709000	1710000	you know what,
1710000	1711000	I really love her,
1711000	1712000	and I really like this kid,
1712000	1713000	so why the fuck not?
1713000	1714000	I mean,
1714000	1715000	my father,
1715000	1716000	my mom,
1716000	1717000	when I was a kid,
1717000	1718000	you know,
1719000	1720000	and,
1720000	1721000	he's a good kid,
1721000	1722000	and it's not that,
1722000	1723000	I mean,
1723000	1724000	it's hard to raise a kid,
1724000	1725000	believe me,
1725000	1726000	but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was,
1726000	1727000	you know,
1727000	1728000	especially when he's a good kid,
1728000	1729000	you know,
1729000	1730000	he's really happy,
1730000	1731000	but, you know,
1731000	1732000	and like,
1732000	1733000	most of that's really from me.
1733000	1734000	They say it's a much stronger love.
1734000	1735000	That you'll ever love,
1735000	1736000	yeah,
1736000	1737000	it's true,
1737000	1738000	it's true,
1738000	1739000	but I also have like,
1739000	1740000	I'm also not,
1740000	1741000	I mean,
1741000	1742000	I'm like the boyfriend,
1742000	1743000	so I mean,
1743000	1744000	I'm the father figure,
1744000	1745000	as well,
1745000	1746000	but I guess I don't have the burden
1746000	1747000	that Marie has,
1747000	1748000	and that's,
1748000	1749000	like I could see hers,
1749000	1750000	she is really upset
1750000	1751000	over little things all the time.
1751000	1752000	I'm like,
1752000	1753000	why are you getting so upset?
1753000	1754000	She'll fuck you.
1755000	1756000	Anyway,
1756000	1757000	we,
1757000	1758000	we,
1758000	1760000	everything was sort of going fine.
1760000	1761000	I got a bit depressed
1761000	1763000	when Peggy died,
1763000	1764000	a very close friend of mine
1764000	1765000	died January 1st.
1767000	1768000	And now,
1768000	1769000	Is it?
1769000	1770000	No,
1770000	1771000	it's 2019,
1771000	1772000	you know,
1773000	1774000	but,
1774000	1775000	that's another story.
1775000	1776000	It's a good story,
1776000	1777000	but a long story.
1777000	1778000	Neil Young,
1778000	1779000	his wife,
1779000	1780000	Peggy,
1780000	1781000	Neil Young is a real dick,
1781000	1783000	a real fucking asshole.
1786000	1788000	When I was at the funeral,
1788000	1789000	he stood up there on stage,
1789000	1790000	it looked like he had won,
1790000	1791000	like Peggy had died,
1791000	1792000	and he got his girl,
1792000	1793000	his daughter back,
1793000	1794000	who was,
1794000	1795000	he was,
1795000	1796000	this,
1796000	1797000	this strange from,
1797000	1798000	and all the money that Peggy took in divorce,
1798000	1799000	and he said,
1799000	1800000	there's like,
1800000	1801000	I won,
1801000	1802000	I got it all back.
1802000	1803000	I had to leave early,
1803000	1804000	I don't know,
1804000	1805000	about what I said.
1808000	1809000	The point of that story is
1809000	1810000	because you need to know
1810000	1811000	that Steve,
1811000	1812000	so Steve Tolst,
1812000	1813000	okay,
1813000	1814000	he's an Australian,
1814000	1815000	and he is a writer.
1816000	1817000	He won like a second prize
1817000	1818000	in a beauty contest,
1818000	1819000	you know,
1819000	1820000	like a runner-up
1820000	1821000	for the Booker Prize,
1821000	1822000	but not even
1822000	1823000	when the Booker Prize,
1823000	1824000	and he only did it
1824000	1825000	because his father
1825000	1826000	is a very well-placed guy
1826000	1827000	in Sydney,
1828000	1829000	and a very wealthy family
1829000	1830000	of lawyers,
1831000	1832000	and they did
1832000	1833000	whatever they could.
1833000	1834000	So,
1834000	1835000	he's sort of like,
1835000	1836000	and I don't say
1836000	1837000	it's just a little bit
1837000	1838000	of the angry boyfriend,
1838000	1839000	he's kind of,
1839000	1840000	he's running the capacity,
1840000	1841000	he's running sort of like,
1841000	1843000	he's not the brightest guy around,
1843000	1844000	but he can fool you
1844000	1846000	into believing he is,
1846000	1847000	you know,
1847000	1848000	and I think he did that
1848000	1849000	to Marie for a long time,
1849000	1850000	and when she sort of caught on
1850000	1851000	what was really happening,
1851000	1852000	she left.
1853000	1854000	But,
1854000	1855000	when I met her,
1855000	1856000	he was still emailing her
1856000	1857000	20, 30 times a day,
1857000	1858000	texting her,
1858000	1859000	sorry,
1859000	1860000	the equivalent,
1860000	1861000	and she thought she
1861000	1862000	had to respond,
1862000	1863000	and I remember
1863000	1864000	being in a car in like,
1864000	1865000	2018,
1865000	1866000	I'm like,
1866000	1867000	why are you responding to this?
1867000	1868000	Why are you doing this?
1868000	1869000	Like, every time you have
1869000	1870000	an issue where you have to
1870000	1871000	say, oh, you're going to be fine,
1871000	1872000	she's like,
1872000	1873000	I don't know,
1873000	1874000	I just feel guilty if I don't.
1874000	1875000	I'm like,
1875000	1876000	well, okay,
1876000	1877000	we don't have to,
1877000	1878000	and then she was
1878000	1879000	like, you're right,
1879000	1880000	I don't,
1880000	1881000	and then she stopped,
1881000	1882000	and that's when it all started.
1882000	1883000	So,
1883000	1884000	he's a kind of guy,
1884000	1885000	I was telling Kim,
1885000	1886000	would rather burn
1886000	1887000	the world down
1887000	1888000	than to
1888000	1889000	allow her to leave him.
1889000	1890000	Okay,
1890000	1891000	and I never met these
1891000	1892000	attached people before.
1892000	1893000	This is new to me,
1893000	1894000	right?
1894000	1895000	Like,
1895000	1896000	first of all,
1896000	1897000	I'm dating a girl with a kid,
1897000	1898000	and now there's a boyfriend,
1898000	1899000	like,
1899000	1900000	the kind you see in
1900000	1901000	freaking television shows,
1901000	1902000	you know,
1902000	1903000	it exists.
1903000	1904000	I didn't know.
1904000	1905000	I didn't know.
1905000	1906000	I thought she was like,
1906000	1907000	I thought Marie was over exaggerating.
1907000	1908000	I'm like,
1908000	1909000	come on,
1909000	1910000	can't it be that offensive?
1910000	1911000	She shows me the best.
1911000	1912000	I'm like,
1912000	1913000	wow,
1913000	1914000	you know,
1914000	1915000	you have to really be crazy.
1915000	1916000	So again,
1916000	1917000	the reason,
1917000	1918000	what you don't know,
1918000	1920000	is that when they first met,
1920000	1921000	it was sort of normal.
1921000	1923000	She was waiting for him to leave,
1923000	1924000	but he stayed
1924000	1925000	and moved into her house.
1925000	1926000	Then he got sick,
1926000	1928000	and aneurysm in his back.
1928000	1930000	It did something to the spinal nerve,
1930000	1931000	and L4,
1931000	1932000	I don't know,
1932000	1933000	I'm not out of position,
1933000	1934000	so I don't know exactly,
1934000	1936000	but it severed the nerve,
1936000	1937000	pinched the nerve.
1937000	1939000	It was something where it paralyzed.
1939000	1940000	Neck down,
1940000	1942000	fully paralyzed.
1942000	1943000	She,
1943000	1945000	Marie is such the type where,
1945000	1947000	she actually wrote a letter to
1947000	1949000	Sarkozy saying,
1949000	1950000	I need your help,
1950000	1951000	is that Australian,
1951000	1953000	and he even paid for his medical bills.
1953000	1954000	And Sarkozy fucking responded,
1954000	1955000	and said,
1955000	1956000	okay.
1956000	1957000	Yeah,
1957000	1958000	that's Marie.
1958000	1960000	So Sarkozy actually paid for his bills?
1960000	1961000	Sarkozy paid for his bills.
1961000	1962000	Probably started to write
1962000	1963000	Sarkozy for health and planning.
1963000	1964000	Right?
1964000	1965000	Yeah,
1965000	1966000	what am I doing here
1966000	1967000	when I talk to Sarkozy?
1967000	1968000	No.
1968000	1969000	But
1969000	1970000	what's really weird
1970000	1971000	is that Steve's father
1971000	1972000	could have paid for it,
1972000	1973000	but they didn't,
1973000	1974000	because they were that type of people.
1974000	1976000	They can get it for free,
1976000	1978000	then they'll take it, right?
1978000	1981000	It doesn't matter that they're taking someone else's
1981000	1982000	scholarship,
1982000	1983000	someone else's
1983000	1984000	fund for their thing,
1984000	1986000	they don't care.
1986000	1988000	So Marie nursed him back to health
1988000	1989000	after a couple years,
1989000	1990000	and he could walk with him.
1990000	1991000	Miracle,
1991000	1992000	it was a 4% chance of walking,
1992000	1993000	you walk.
1993000	1994000	Oh no,
1994000	1995000	sorry,
1995000	1996000	not 4% chance.
1996000	1997000	That was,
1997000	1998000	that was having Marlowe's 4% chance.
1998000	1999000	It was like a very low
1999000	2000000	percent chance of walking,
2000000	2001000	but he was up and walking.
2001000	2002000	But
2002000	2004000	he would forever have to wear a catheter.
2004000	2006000	I think it costs me back,
2006000	2007000	I'm not sure how long that lasted,
2007000	2008000	but of course,
2008000	2009000	the guy,
2009000	2010000	no hard on,
2010000	2011000	cannot get it up,
2011000	2012000	no sex.
2012000	2013000	So Marie
2013000	2014000	just was in her,
2014000	2015000	she's very loyal,
2015000	2016000	and she was 22,
2016000	2017000	and she met him,
2017000	2018000	very young and naive.
2018000	2019000	So,
2019000	2020000	what am I doing?
2020000	2021000	I guess,
2021000	2022000	can't,
2022000	2023000	you know,
2023000	2024000	I have to stick with this guy.
2024000	2025000	You know,
2025000	2026000	she did last as long as she could,
2026000	2027000	and his mind
2027000	2029000	and body deteriorated further and further,
2029000	2030000	and then she just left.
2030000	2031000	She couldn't take it much,
2031000	2032000	she left.
2032000	2033000	Now,
2033000	2034000	between us,
2034000	2035000	they separated in,
2035000	2036000	I think 2013,
2036000	2037000	but for the lawyers,
2037000	2038000	it's 2018.
2038000	2040000	Just so you know,
2040000	2041000	because she's,
2041000	2042000	you know,
2042000	2043000	for the,
2043000	2044000	you know,
2044000	2045000	I don't know any about divorce either,
2045000	2046000	but the lawyer said,
2046000	2047000	let's just say 2018.
2047000	2048000	Okay,
2048000	2049000	so I don't know.
2049000	2050000	So,
2050000	2051000	when,
2051000	2053000	I met him for the first time,
2053000	2054000	he seemed,
2054000	2055000	I mean,
2055000	2056000	I was like,
2056000	2057000	oh, hello,
2057000	2058000	my name's Val,
2058000	2059000	I'm the guy that's fucking your wife.
2059000	2060000	He's like,
2060000	2061000	ah, ha, ha,
2061000	2062000	very funny.
2062000	2063000	It was a joke,
2063000	2064000	and he laughed,
2064000	2065000	and he took it well.
2065000	2066000	He did?
2066000	2067000	Yeah.
2067000	2068000	He took a chance.
2068000	2069000	I did,
2069000	2070000	I did.
2070000	2071000	Everyone else laughs,
2071000	2072000	you know,
2072000	2073000	but,
2073000	2075000	he became more obsessive.
2075000	2077000	The text increased
2077000	2078000	tremendously.
2078000	2079000	I mean,
2079000	2081000	we're talking like 50 to 60,
2081000	2082000	answering me,
2082000	2083000	what are you doing?
2083000	2084000	I don't understand.
2084000	2085000	And they were like,
2085000	2086000	really negative.
2086000	2087000	It's all designed to make her hurt,
2087000	2088000	feel like shit,
2088000	2089000	feel guilty,
2089000	2090000	you know,
2090000	2091000	or feel sorry for him.
2091000	2092000	Every single one is designed for that.
2092000	2093000	I printed them all out,
2093000	2094000	gave them to the lawyer.
2094000	2095000	It's,
2095000	2096000	just to read them,
2096000	2097000	it's like weird.
2097000	2098000	You guys,
2098000	2099000	it's a fun read,
2099000	2100000	if you ever want to,
2100000	2101000	if you're bored.
2101000	2102000	I'll send it to you if you want.
2102000	2103000	But it's disturbing,
2103000	2104000	too,
2104000	2105000	because it's a sign of obsession,
2105000	2107000	and that's never going to end well,
2107000	2108000	you know.
2108000	2109000	So,
2109000	2111000	fast forward to a bunch of stuff,
2111000	2113000	on April 10th,
2113000	2114000	or,
2114000	2115000	sorry,
2115000	2116000	before April 10th,
2116000	2117000	COVID hit,
2117000	2118000	and Marla had to be
2118000	2119000	taught home,
2119000	2120000	homeschooled now,
2120000	2121000	so he had the logins
2121000	2122000	to the computer,
2122000	2123000	you know,
2123000	2124000	such a nightmare at first.
2124000	2126000	It was such a nightmare.
2126000	2128000	Oh, man, yeah.
2128000	2130000	Trying to get him to do homework,
2130000	2131000	and he's lying,
2131000	2132000	now he's lying all the time.
2132000	2133000	And this kid,
2133000	2134000	he never lied.
2134000	2135000	He like,
2135000	2136000	was so honest and happy,
2136000	2137000	he couldn't put him anywhere,
2137000	2139000	and he would start talking to everybody,
2139000	2140000	and everyone would be
2140000	2141000	in trance by his conversation.
2141000	2143000	He is a smart kid,
2143000	2144000	he's so smart.
2144000	2145000	But now,
2145000	2146000	he's lying.
2146000	2147000	I mean,
2147000	2148000	why is he lying?
2148000	2149000	Is he trying to hide something?
2149000	2150000	He's depressed,
2150000	2151000	he's something's wrong,
2151000	2152000	he doesn't either,
2152000	2153000	but Marie always blames Steve,
2153000	2154000	no matter what,
2154000	2155000	it's always Steve.
2155000	2156000	And I kind of learned
2156000	2157000	that she's,
2157000	2158000	you know,
2158000	2159000	almost always right too,
2159000	2160000	you know,
2160000	2161000	because he comes,
2161000	2163000	it's a 50-50 custody at this point.
2163000	2164000	Sorry,
2164000	2165000	for a year,
2165000	2166000	it was 50-50 custody.
2166000	2167000	Before that,
2167000	2168000	it was 80-20,
2168000	2169000	Marie, okay?
2169000	2170000	But for the last year,
2170000	2172000	they tried 50-50.
2172000	2173000	Steve says,
2173000	2174000	and I have a lot of records,
2174000	2175000	saying I cannot take care
2175000	2176000	of Marla for more than a week
2176000	2177000	at a time.
2177000	2178000	All he does
2178000	2179000	is he sits in the little office,
2179000	2181000	and he writes the books.
2181000	2183000	He works for screenwriting
2183000	2187000	for some comedy TV show,
2187000	2189000	it's not very funny.
2189000	2191000	Two police officers
2191000	2192000	are detectives in a car
2192000	2193000	the whole time.
2193000	2194000	Security?
2194000	2195000	Something security?
2195000	2196000	I don't know.
2196000	2197000	It's not that good.
2197000	2199000	It's not that good.
2199000	2201000	So that's why he's in the country.
2201000	2202000	Not Tim and Jamie.
2202000	2203000	I needed,
2203000	2204000	Marie wanted to divorce him,
2204000	2205000	she's been wanting him
2205000	2206000	for so long,
2206000	2207000	but she can't,
2207000	2208000	because,
2209000	2212000	but because of the visa
2212000	2213000	that she was on,
2213000	2214000	she was tied to it,
2214000	2216000	she could not work in America,
2216000	2217000	and she was trying to do,
2217000	2218000	you know,
2218000	2219000	she would still
2219000	2220000	do some cash jobs,
2220000	2222000	or she'd teach French,
2222000	2223000	or art,
2223000	2225000	to the mothers,
2225000	2226000	to go to a school called Lila,
2226000	2228000	it's a French,
2228000	2230000	for French people.
2230000	2231000	And there's something
2231000	2232000	we were going on about that
2232000	2233000	school too,
2233000	2235000	you guys should be aware of.
2235000	2236000	Very,
2236000	2237000	something's off.
2238000	2239000	But,
2241000	2242000	what was I saying?
2242000	2243000	Sorry,
2243000	2244000	you know that Lila,
2244000	2245000	French school,
2245000	2247000	and it brought up,
2247000	2248000	80, 20, 50, 50.
2248000	2249000	Yeah, the custody,
2249000	2250000	that's right.
2250000	2251000	Yeah.
2251000	2252000	And then COVID.
2252000	2253000	That's right.
2255000	2256000	Yeah, she's,
2256000	2257000	well, now Marie works in rehab.
2257000	2259000	She works at arts,
2259000	2260000	which is another crazy thing
2260000	2261000	about DCFS.
2261000	2262000	She works in rehab,
2262000	2263000	which is randomly drug tested
2263000	2264000	every week, right?
2264000	2265000	So,
2265000	2266000	but I'll get to that.
2267000	2268000	She teaches art therapy
2268000	2270000	to all these drug addicts.
2272000	2273000	She's able to work,
2273000	2274000	and Marla's able to work,
2274000	2275000	and everything's going fine,
2275000	2277000	and then Steve,
2277000	2279000	one day, comes over,
2279000	2281000	because we're a day late,
2281000	2283000	or there was some misinterpretation,
2283000	2284000	and this,
2284000	2285000	something happened,
2285000	2286000	someone didn't communicate
2286000	2287000	with someone about Marla,
2287000	2288000	one who was supposed to be picked up.
2288000	2290000	Steve knows to never come
2290000	2292000	by place, or loft.
2292000	2293000	He knows to never come by,
2293000	2295000	and we don't go to his place either.
2295000	2297000	It's an unspoken rule.
2297000	2298000	He comes over,
2298000	2299000	and he,
2299000	2301000	he's wearing a mask
2301000	2302000	that was white,
2302000	2303000	but he drew,
2303000	2304000	and this was really weird,
2304000	2306000	I thought, he drew teeth.
2306000	2308000	He's a 50 year old man,
2308000	2309000	okay, and he drew teeth
2309000	2310000	on the mask.
2311000	2312000	He came over,
2312000	2313000	and I had a security camera,
2313000	2315000	so I had the whole thing on tape.
2315000	2316000	It was wonderful,
2316000	2317000	this is fucking hilarious.
2317000	2318000	But,
2318000	2319000	he goes,
2319000	2320000	he comes over,
2320000	2321000	and you know,
2321000	2322000	you see pedestrians throw by,
2322000	2323000	and they're just normal people,
2323000	2324000	when you can see someone going for a run,
2324000	2326000	and someone just walking the dog,
2326000	2327000	but then you see a slow,
2327000	2329000	perambling,
2329000	2330000	what the hell is this?
2330000	2331000	And it's, of course, Steve.
2331000	2332000	I mean, I don't know if he's high,
2332000	2334000	I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy.
2334000	2336000	But he makes it to the front door,
2336000	2337000	he knocks,
2337000	2339000	he blows up his one sleeve,
2339000	2341000	he's preparing for something, obviously.
2341000	2342000	And,
2342000	2343000	no, I don't,
2343000	2344000	I don't really see this in retrospect.
2344000	2345000	At the time,
2345000	2347000	I'm upstairs having a joke
2347000	2349000	and laughing with Marla and Marie.
2349000	2351000	Like, we're like on the floor laughing
2351000	2353000	about word Al Jankiewicz,
2353000	2354000	because Yoda,
2354000	2355000	you know what I'm saying, Yoda?
2355000	2356000	Why Yoda?
2356000	2357000	Yoda is great.
2357000	2358000	But Marla just learned it,
2358000	2359000	so he was laughing.
2359000	2360000	And then the door is,
2360000	2361000	someone's knocking the door,
2361000	2363000	and it's around five o'clock, I remember,
2363000	2365000	because that's when Steve's always on time,
2365000	2366000	perfectly.
2366000	2367000	And I'm like,
2367000	2368000	what the fuck?
2368000	2369000	So I said,
2369000	2370000	I'll go check,
2370000	2371000	and I open the door,
2371000	2372000	and I see Steve,
2372000	2373000	and Steve goes,
2373000	2374000	Marla,
2374000	2375000	Marla,
2375000	2376000	he starts screaming for Marla.
2376000	2377000	Marie is so freaked out,
2377000	2378000	she takes Marla,
2378000	2379000	and she hides in the bathroom.
2379000	2381000	It's the only door in the loft as a lock,
2381000	2382000	and it's like,
2382000	2384000	just the furthest,
2384000	2386000	it's the furthest from the front door,
2386000	2387000	actually, too.
2387000	2388000	And I was like,
2388000	2389000	wow,
2389000	2390000	like she really,
2390000	2391000	she was fucking scared.
2391000	2392000	And I don't want her scared,
2392000	2393000	it's just like a little,
2393000	2394000	you know,
2394000	2395000	puny guy can barely walk,
2395000	2396000	so I,
2396000	2397000	but he starts,
2397000	2398000	he says,
2398000	2399000	I want him to,
2399000	2400000	I'm here to pick up Marla,
2400000	2401000	and I say,
2401000	2402000	no, you're not,
2402000	2403000	you cannot be here,
2403000	2404000	you're not supposed to be here.
2404000	2405000	What are you doing here?
2405000	2406000	You gotta go.
2406000	2407000	No, I'm picking up Marla,
2407000	2408000	it's five o'clock,
2408000	2409000	look, just,
2409000	2410000	let me put on some shoes,
2410000	2411000	and some socks,
2411000	2412000	and a jacket,
2412000	2413000	and I was,
2413000	2414000	I wasn't fully dressed,
2414000	2415000	I was like,
2415000	2416000	sweatpants,
2416000	2417000	and shirt.
2417000	2418000	Let me come outside,
2418000	2419000	and I'll,
2419000	2420000	and I'll talk to you about it.
2420000	2421000	He said,
2421000	2422000	well,
2422000	2423000	there's not much to talk about,
2423000	2424000	but okay,
2424000	2425000	so he goes back,
2425000	2426000	I close the door,
2426000	2427000	and now,
2427000	2428000	what I learned later,
2428000	2429000	is when I closed the door,
2429000	2431000	he whipped out his cell phone,
2431000	2432000	and he opened up an app,
2432000	2435000	and he starts flipping through porn.
2435000	2437000	Normal, right?
2438000	2439000	No, not,
2439000	2440000	very odd behavior.
2440000	2441000	I was like,
2441000	2442000	what the fuck,
2442000	2443000	but it wasn't like porn porn,
2443000	2445000	it was like dating site porn,
2445000	2447000	with the couples.
2447000	2448000	It was fucking weird,
2448000	2449000	right?
2449000	2450000	To come over to the house,
2450000	2451000	not gonna be angry at me,
2451000	2452000	because he was kind of like,
2452000	2453000	his voice was raised,
2453000	2454000	I'm telling you,
2454000	2455000	like a really brief version,
2455000	2456000	but then just like,
2456000	2457000	not chill out,
2457000	2458000	like,
2458000	2459000	it was very strange.
2459000	2460000	I tell him,
2460000	2461000	look, it's okay,
2461000	2462000	I'm gonna handle it,
2462000	2463000	and Marla says,
2463000	2464000	you know what,
2464000	2465000	my dad,
2465000	2466000	he just needs to be reassured,
2466000	2467000	and Marla's like,
2467000	2468000	no, no, no,
2468000	2469000	no reassuring,
2469000	2470000	just stay here with me in the bathtub,
2470000	2471000	and like,
2471000	2472000	you guys are just gonna be fine,
2472000	2473000	I'm just gonna talk to him,
2473000	2474000	and you'll leave.
2474000	2475000	So I get dressed,
2475000	2476000	I open the door,
2476000	2477000	and the door opens up this way,
2477000	2479000	and then as my door,
2479000	2480000	as the door's open,
2480000	2481000	he comes in,
2481000	2482000	shoulder,
2482000	2483000	right here,
2483000	2484000	to break my,
2484000	2485000	my,
2485000	2486000	my grip,
2486000	2487000	on the door,
2487000	2488000	but I,
2488000	2489000	he's not that strong,
2489000	2490000	so I,
2490000	2491000	he doesn't break my grip,
2491000	2492000	he just makes me upset,
2492000	2493000	so I grab,
2493000	2494000	and I pull him out,
2494000	2495000	and he doesn't quite hit the car,
2495000	2497000	his first reaction is,
2497000	2498000	oh, my back,
2498000	2499000	right,
2499000	2500000	like a,
2500000	2501000	sort of like a,
2501000	2502000	childish thing,
2502000	2503000	very strange,
2503000	2504000	for a 50-year-old man,
2504000	2505000	and I said,
2505000	2506000	oh, shut the fuck up,
2506000	2507000	and now you can hear me,
2507000	2508000	the profanity's out,
2508000	2509000	I'm like,
2509000	2510000	are you stupid,
2510000	2511000	are you that stupid,
2511000	2512000	I mean,
2512000	2513000	to fight a,
2513000	2514000	you know,
2514000	2515000	and I said,
2515000	2516000	this is California,
2516000	2517000	this is,
2517000	2518000	you know,
2518000	2519000	good thing I'm not like California,
2519000	2520000	because,
2520000	2521000	you know,
2521000	2522000	they carry guns,
2522000	2523000	like,
2523000	2524000	people can have guns,
2524000	2525000	I don't even have a gun,
2525000	2526000	you know,
2526000	2527000	things like this,
2527000	2528000	and then he,
2528000	2529000	he,
2529000	2530000	I said,
2530000	2531000	look,
2531000	2532000	this is on camera,
2532000	2533000	then he's like,
2533000	2534000	you just lost,
2534000	2535000	you just lost the divorce,
2535000	2536000	you just lost everything,
2536000	2537000	you fucked up man,
2537000	2538000	you gotta go now,
2538000	2539000	he's like,
2539000	2540000	I'm not leaving,
2540000	2541000	so,
2541000	2542000	short version is,
2542000	2544000	I throw him out to the sidewalk,
2544000	2546000	I push him until he's in the,
2546000	2547000	it's still private property,
2547000	2548000	but I just sort of say,
2548000	2549000	now you're in the streets,
2549000	2550000	you can leave us alone though,
2550000	2551000	and I tell you,
2551000	2552000	I will,
2552000	2553000	and I made him a promise,
2553000	2554000	I will bring Marlo out,
2554000	2555000	you can say hello to Marlo,
2555000	2556000	I will bring him out,
2556000	2557000	and you have my word on that,
2557000	2559000	but you have to be by your car,
2559000	2561000	you cannot be on our property,
2561000	2562000	and you can agree to do it,
2562000	2563000	go to his car,
2563000	2564000	so Marlo,
2564000	2566000	please do me a favor,
2566000	2567000	can you come out with me,
2567000	2569000	but just don't let go of my hand,
2569000	2570000	and Marlo says,
2570000	2571000	okay,
2571000	2572000	and he does not let go of my hand
2572000	2573000	all the time,
2573000	2574000	because I know he's gonna try and steal him,
2574000	2575000	and he tried twice,
2575000	2576000	the whole time,
2576000	2579000	I recorded everything on my phone,
2579000	2580000	it's all,
2580000	2581000	it's all there,
2581000	2582000	and the video camera,
2582000	2584000	so when that incident occurred,
2584000	2585000	Marie and I sat down and talked,
2585000	2586000	and she said,
2586000	2588000	the deterioration has gone severe,
2588000	2591000	this is a line that's crossed,
2591000	2594000	and Marie's in the middle of the forest,
2594000	2596000	and to cross this line,
2596000	2598000	in the middle of the forest,
2598000	2599000	is very stupid,
2599000	2600000	okay,
2600000	2602000	so that means the brain has deteriorated
2602000	2604000	further than we even imagined,
2604000	2606000	so Marie is very concerned,
2606000	2607000	and she's like,
2607000	2610000	I'm not giving Marlo back down,
2610000	2612000	so she holds on to Marlo
2612000	2614000	for the last five months,
2614000	2615000	so we had Marlo,
2615000	2616000	and we were like,
2616000	2617000	it's fun to have like,
2617000	2618000	now we're like a family,
2618000	2619000	for five months,
2619000	2620000	we found Marlo,
2620000	2621000	you know,
2621000	2623000	we all got to know each other,
2623000	2624000	and Marlo,
2624000	2625000	you know,
2625000	2626000	it's really funny,
2626000	2628000	it was nice.
2628000	2631000	How long have you been living with Marlo?
2631000	2633000	Two and a half years now,
2633000	2634000	but you know,
2634000	2635000	you see Marlo every other week.
2635000	2636000	Like five months?
2636000	2637000	Yeah, yeah,
2637000	2639000	it was a lot at first,
2639000	2640000	especially for me,
2640000	2641000	but I got used to it,
2641000	2642000	it wasn't,
2642000	2643000	it wasn't so,
2643000	2644000	you know,
2644000	2647000	I thought it was going to be even worse for me,
2647000	2648000	but you know,
2648000	2649000	expect the worst.
2649000	2650000	It's a good day,
2650000	2651000	it could go any way.
2651000	2653000	Yeah, it's true, it's true,
2653000	2654000	but you know,
2654000	2655000	and we'd see Steven,
2655000	2656000	and the fear,
2656000	2657000	see the fear and the lying,
2657000	2659000	and we'd try to teach him to not lie,
2659000	2660000	like he starts lying,
2660000	2661000	like he talks,
2661000	2662000	I said,
2662000	2663000	Marlo,
2663000	2664000	why are these lies?
2664000	2665000	And we know where they come from,
2665000	2666000	because Steve,
2666000	2667000	this is how Steve talks,
2667000	2668000	he lies constantly,
2668000	2669000	he's always,
2669000	2670000	he's always,
2670000	2673000	and we felt like we made some progress,
2673000	2674000	you know,
2674000	2675000	he was,
2675000	2676000	he had more self-confidence,
2676000	2677000	like he was afraid of dancing,
2677000	2678000	and eight year old,
2678000	2679000	afraid of dancing,
2679000	2680000	because he's self-conscious,
2680000	2681000	he's fucking silly,
2681000	2682000	so we started dancing more
2682000	2683000	to make him less self-conscious,
2683000	2684000	and we did these kung fu outfits,
2684000	2686000	so we pretended we were kung fu fighting,
2686000	2687000	you know,
2687000	2688000	saw him kung fu fighting,
2688000	2689000	he loves it,
2689000	2690000	so his confidence is back,
2690000	2691000	he's happy,
2691000	2692000	and he fucking said to me,
2692000	2693000	three days before this,
2693000	2694000	all went to shit,
2694000	2695000	he said,
2695000	2696000	well,
2696000	2697000	I wish you were my father,
2697000	2698000	he said to me,
2698000	2699000	and it broke my heart,
2699000	2700000	it broke my heart,
2700000	2701000	I mean,
2701000	2702000	I felt great and warm,
2702000	2703000	but it also broke my heart,
2703000	2704000	you know,
2704000	2705000	and I know that feeling,
2705000	2706000	because I grew up in foster care,
2706000	2707000	you know,
2707000	2708000	I know that feeling,
2708000	2710000	I've been to two different,
2710000	2711000	different families,
2711000	2712000	and different mothers,
2712000	2713000	and different fathers,
2713000	2716000	I had two brothers once in foster care,
2716000	2717000	you know,
2717000	2718000	you know, home.
2718000	2719000	You remember it pretty well?
2719000	2720000	Yeah, yeah,
2720000	2722000	and one I don't,
2722000	2723000	two I remember pretty well,
2723000	2726000	the last one I remember very well,
2726000	2727000	because there was,
2727000	2729000	there wasn't the horrible system
2729000	2730000	that you hear about,
2730000	2732000	this is a nice happy Jewish family,
2732000	2733000	a loving family,
2733000	2734000	they're like good people,
2734000	2735000	you know,
2735000	2736000	even in Chicago,
2736000	2737000	in Cook County,
2737000	2740000	Carol and Larry Payless,
2740000	2741000	I remember,
2741000	2742000	it's not like the shoe store,
2742000	2743000	it's Payless,
2743000	2744000	I said,
2744000	2745000	oh,
2745000	2746000	sometimes for a different climate,
2746000	2747000	it's a lot like a craft shoe,
2747000	2748000	I see.
2748000	2749000	Yeah,
2749000	2750000	I got lucky,
2750000	2751000	I got lucky,
2751000	2752000	because I heard the stories,
2752000	2753000	you know,
2754000	2755000	so,
2758000	2759000	it's still,
2759000	2761000	it's still in the middle, yeah.
2763000	2764000	No, nothing,
2764000	2765000	there's fighting,
2765000	2766000	and Steve is using this now,
2766000	2768000	as a tool in the divorce,
2768000	2770000	everything that just happened is,
2770000	2772000	weaponizing DCFS,
2772000	2774000	he just did it,
2775000	2777000	and it forgot it limited capacity,
2777000	2778000	I know that it wasn't him,
2778000	2779000	it's gotta be the lawyers,
2779000	2781000	his lawyers are pretty smart,
2781000	2782000	because he's got money,
2782000	2783000	he's got like seven lawyers,
2783000	2784000	you know,
2784000	2785000	you have one guy
2785000	2787000	that barely leaves his office,
2787000	2788000	we do most of the work,
2788000	2789000	Marie and I.
2790000	2791000	Anyway,
2794000	2796000	so Marie and I are like,
2796000	2798000	we've gone through two cleaning ladies,
2798000	2799000	one live in the brewery,
2799000	2800000	and one girl,
2800000	2801000	she's great,
2801000	2803000	she was like too cute for me,
2803000	2804000	because,
2804000	2805000	why is she doing it?
2805000	2806000	Marie,
2806000	2807000	why is she doing it?
2807000	2808000	I'm not staring at her,
2808000	2809000	why does she have to worry
2809000	2810000	about these tight pants?
2810000	2811000	I'm like,
2811000	2812000	no, I didn't ask her,
2812000	2813000	it's not my fault,
2813000	2814000	and then one day,
2814000	2815000	she's like,
2815000	2816000	you know what,
2816000	2817000	I don't want to clean,
2817000	2818000	I want to sing,
2818000	2819000	I want to make music,
2819000	2820000	I'm like, okay,
2820000	2821000	go make some music,
2821000	2822000	so she quit,
2822000	2823000	so we start cleaning,
2823000	2824000	and in Richard,
2824000	2825000	you know,
2825000	2826000	Marla gets in trouble,
2826000	2827000	we're like,
2827000	2828000	oh,
2828000	2829000	you gotta do the dishes,
2829000	2830000	you know,
2830000	2831000	you have to wipe and clean,
2831000	2832000	and he doesn't like that either,
2832000	2833000	so we thought,
2833000	2834000	why not do,
2834000	2835000	get a nanny slash,
2835000	2836000	a housekeeper,
2836000	2837000	okay,
2837000	2838000	somebody can do both,
2838000	2839000	watch Marla,
2839000	2840000	we can have some time alone,
2840000	2842000	and they can clean the fucking house.
2842000	2844000	So we do put the feelers out,
2844000	2845000	Marie puts them out
2845000	2848000	on some next door,
2848000	2850000	it's a couple other websites.
2850000	2851000	I ask everybody,
2851000	2852000	I know,
2852000	2853000	oh,
2853000	2854000	sorry,
2854000	2855000	I forgot,
2855000	2856000	I almost forgot Patel.
2856000	2859000	Patel is a labor,
2859000	2860000	one,
2860000	2861000	two,
2861000	2862000	three,
2862000	2863000	three doors down,
2863000	2864000	four doors down,
2864000	2865000	I thought she'd just moved in,
2865000	2866000	in like July,
2866000	2867000	or sorry,
2867000	2868000	mid June,
2868000	2869000	I'd never seen her before,
2869000	2870000	but all of a sudden,
2870000	2871000	she's there,
2871000	2872000	everywhere,
2872000	2873000	very loud and boisterous,
2873000	2874000	and she,
2874000	2875000	outside,
2875000	2876000	look,
2876000	2877000	at our place,
2877000	2878000	there's a little park
2878000	2879000	across the way,
2879000	2881000	and Marla always hangs out there,
2881000	2882000	and so everyone,
2882000	2883000	sort of,
2883000	2884000	the brewery,
2884000	2885000	the brewery,
2885000	2886000	artist loft,
2886000	2887000	it's like an artist community,
2887000	2889000	so it's a campus,
2889000	2890000	more or less,
2890000	2892000	and it's just 300 lofts,
2892000	2894000	with a whole bunch of it,
2894000	2896000	with six or 900 people in it,
2896000	2897000	it's a different spot,
2897000	2898000	so everyone hangs out
2898000	2899000	in the sort of park areas,
2899000	2900000	where we are,
2900000	2902000	because it's closest to us.
2902000	2903000	She says,
2903000	2904000	she saw him in the park,
2904000	2906000	and she showed him his jewelry,
2906000	2907000	and he said,
2907000	2908000	oh, I want to make this,
2908000	2909000	just some jewelry,
2909000	2910000	and I was like,
2910000	2911000	you want to make crystal jewelry?
2911000	2912000	He's like,
2912000	2913000	yes,
2913000	2914000	I want to make crystal jewelry.
2914000	2915000	Like, okay, Marla,
2915000	2916000	you can make some crystal jewelry.
2916000	2917000	So we take him over there,
2917000	2919000	and she seems sane, right?
2919000	2920000	I know something's off,
2920000	2921000	you know,
2921000	2922000	I mean,
2922000	2923000	I can sense it,
2923000	2924000	I know something's wrong,
2924000	2926000	but I figure maybe this is like,
2926000	2927000	she's in a,
2927000	2929000	just got her parents' house,
2929000	2930000	or she's moving,
2930000	2931000	trying to make her life,
2931000	2932000	or start a new world.
2932000	2933000	I mean,
2933000	2934000	there's no way she's making money
2934000	2935000	selling crystal jewelry, okay?
2935000	2936000	It's,
2936000	2937000	first of all,
2937000	2938000	it's shitty jewelry,
2938000	2939000	no one's buying it,
2939000	2940000	and it's way too expensive.
2940000	2941000	It's not $4,500 a month,
2941000	2942000	on that place.
2942000	2943000	I know what she's paying too.
2943000	2944000	So,
2944000	2945000	I figure there's some parents
2945000	2946000	paying for it,
2946000	2947000	or something,
2947000	2948000	or maybe a brother,
2948000	2950000	definitely not a sugar daddy type,
2950000	2952000	because she's the most unattractive
2952000	2953000	woman I've ever seen.
2953000	2954000	Like,
2954000	2955000	you see her,
2955000	2956000	and you're like,
2956000	2957000	whoa,
2957000	2958000	okay,
2958000	2959000	and it's unfortunate for her,
2959000	2960000	but it is true.
2960000	2961000	So,
2961000	2962000	anyway,
2962000	2963000	she,
2963000	2964000	we brought her over,
2964000	2965000	and we approved
2965000	2966000	for like two hours a day.
2966000	2967000	We thought that couldn't be,
2967000	2968000	literally,
2968000	2969000	you can walk in 10 seconds
2969000	2970000	and get to her house,
2970000	2971000	or something.
2971000	2972000	It's like,
2972000	2973000	there's no danger,
2973000	2974000	you know?
2974000	2975000	And Miles said,
2975000	2976000	please, please,
2976000	2977000	can I have that crystal jewelry, please?
2977000	2978000	Okay,
2978000	2979000	yes,
2979000	2980000	and we get two hours to ourselves now.
2980000	2981000	So,
2981000	2982000	we're happy.
2982000	2983000	So,
2983000	2984000	for five days,
2984000	2985000	and he makes crystal jewelry.
2985000	2986000	He comes back for lunch.
2986000	2987000	He eats with us.
2987000	2988000	Sometimes,
2988000	2989000	Marie brings them lunch.
2989000	2990000	Sometimes,
2990000	2991000	I'll go over there
2991000	2992000	and just see what's going on.
2992000	2993000	Everything's friendly and copicetic.
2993000	2994000	You can always,
2994000	2995000	she's no problem.
2995000	2996000	She's a talker.
2996000	2997000	She likes to jab her
2997000	2998000	about herself.
2998000	2999000	She will not ask you anything
2999000	3000000	about how you are,
3000000	3001000	where you're from,
3001000	3002000	or anything.
3002000	3003000	She'll just tell you everything
3003000	3004000	she knows about everybody.
3004000	3005000	Gossip,
3005000	3006000	gossip, gossip.
3006000	3007000	People live like that.
3007000	3008000	Yeah,
3008000	3009000	yeah.
3009000	3010000	It's,
3010000	3011000	well,
3011000	3012000	it's because that's what she thinks
3012000	3013000	her value is,
3013000	3014000	and that's why we're,
3014000	3015000	you know,
3015000	3016000	it's very,
3016000	3017000	I understand it,
3017000	3018000	but,
3018000	3019000	but I mentioned,
3019000	3020000	Marlo,
3020000	3021000	like,
3021000	3022000	making crafts.
3022000	3023000	Anything,
3023000	3024000	and we found someone,
3024000	3025000	like,
3025000	3026000	I'll talk to him, too.
3026000	3027000	And that was like,
3027000	3028000	you know,
3028000	3029000	it was so,
3029000	3030000	it was interesting,
3030000	3031000	but he loved it.
3031000	3032000	And he even said,
3032000	3033000	down,
3033000	3034000	down Marlo,
3034000	3035000	bye,
3035000	3036000	have you liked my whole life?
3036000	3037000	I've already made crystal jewelry.
3037000	3038000	Your whole life,
3038000	3039000	figures on.
3039000	3040000	He's like,
3040000	3041000	it's a huge revelation,
3041000	3042000	yeah.
3042000	3043000	All right, Marlo,
3043000	3044000	you go for it.
3044000	3045000	Of course,
3045000	3046000	he got bored with it,
3046000	3047000	you know,
3047000	3048000	four days later.
3048000	3049000	But on Saturday,
3049000	3050000	Patil decided to sell the jewelry
3050000	3052000	that she had been making with Marlo.
3052000	3053000	So,
3053000	3054000	they go and they set up
3054000	3055000	a thing in the park,
3055000	3056000	like,
3056000	3057000	just a table,
3057000	3058000	and all the people from
3058000	3059000	the community come over
3059000	3060000	and they see Marlo,
3060000	3061000	and he's fucking adorable,
3061000	3062000	selling jewelry,
3062000	3063000	so people buy jewelry.
3063000	3064000	Of course,
3064000	3065000	I buy most of it,
3065000	3066000	you know,
3066000	3067000	so,
3067000	3068000	and I have to buy some Patil's jewelry, too,
3068000	3069000	because it looks bad,
3069000	3071000	but she's not really selling any.
3071000	3072000	So,
3072000	3073000	I buy some of her,
3073000	3074000	so I spend like 250 bucks
3074000	3075000	on this useless jewelry
3075000	3076000	that's already broken,
3076000	3077000	right?
3077000	3078000	Um,
3078000	3079000	Steve is $250.
3079000	3080000	I don't know.
3080000	3081000	No,
3081000	3082000	no,
3082000	3083000	I've not,
3083000	3084000	but it's like 30 pieces,
3084000	3085000	you know,
3085000	3086000	it's ridiculous.
3086000	3087000	Yeah,
3087000	3088000	you don't need it,
3088000	3089000	trust me.
3089000	3090000	It's not necessary.
3090000	3091000	But,
3091000	3092000	but Steve,
3092000	3093000	I invite Steve,
3093000	3094000	because I'm a nice guy.
3094000	3095000	So,
3095000	3096000	I'm like,
3096000	3097000	Steve would like to see this.
3097000	3098000	His son is making money
3098000	3099000	on something he created
3099000	3100000	on his own.
3100000	3101000	He's better than with his first $20.
3101000	3102000	So,
3102000	3103000	he's ever earned.
3103000	3104000	Steve would like to see this.
3104000	3105000	I think it would be a good idea.
3105000	3106000	And Marie's like,
3106000	3107000	no.
3107000	3108000	I say,
3108000	3109000	come on,
3109000	3110000	let him,
3110000	3111000	he's got to,
3111000	3112000	he'll enjoy this.
3112000	3113000	Because we give him visits every week
3113000	3114000	or whenever he wants to,
3114000	3115000	well,
3115000	3116000	not whenever,
3116000	3117000	basically once a week,
3117000	3118000	but whenever he wants to talk tomorrow,
3118000	3119000	we let him talk,
3119000	3120000	unless tomorrow does not want to talk
3120000	3121000	and not as often.
3121000	3122000	And he does not want to accept that.
3122000	3123000	Um,
3123000	3124000	so,
3124000	3125000	I invite him over
3125000	3126000	and he comes over
3126000	3127000	and,
3127000	3128000	um,
3129000	3130000	and,
3132000	3133000	oh, shit.
3133000	3134000	Um,
3134000	3135000	I forgot I'm working today too,
3135000	3136000	but it's okay.
3136000	3137000	I put on an option
3137000	3138000	because I don't have to worry about it
3138000	3139000	till next week.
3139000	3140000	Um,
3140000	3141000	so,
3142000	3143000	he comes over
3143000	3144000	and he's
3144000	3145000	instantly in the mood changes.
3145000	3146000	You'll,
3146000	3147000	if you ever meet him,
3147000	3148000	you'll see for yourself.
3148000	3149000	You know,
3149000	3150000	it's one of those people,
3150000	3151000	everything's sort of down,
3151000	3152000	now I'm depressing
3152000	3153000	and self-conscious.
3153000	3154000	You know,
3154000	3155000	because that's what he,
3155000	3156000	that's what he emulates.
3156000	3157000	Um,
3157000	3158000	he seems somewhat immune
3158000	3159000	to it right now,
3159000	3160000	but he won't be in the future.
3160000	3161000	I know it.
3161000	3162000	I could see it happen.
3162000	3163000	Um,
3163000	3164000	he asked Patille
3164000	3165000	for her number.
3165000	3166000	Steve.
3166000	3167000	Steve does.
3167000	3169000	Which I thought was strange.
3169000	3170000	Um,
3170000	3171000	but not too strange.
3171000	3172000	Marie said
3172000	3173000	he never asked people
3173000	3174000	for her number.
3174000	3176000	This is not a good idea.
3176000	3177000	Okay.
3177000	3178000	And I said,
3178000	3179000	well,
3179000	3180000	I'll trust you.
3180000	3181000	Um,
3182000	3183000	later that night,
3183000	3184000	Patille,
3185000	3186000	uh,
3186000	3187000	Marie and I are,
3187000	3188000	uh, walking.
3188000	3189000	For some reason,
3189000	3190000	we didn't walk to the,
3190000	3191000	now we weren't doing the laundry,
3191000	3192000	we had to walk past the park.
3192000	3193000	I can't remember why.
3193000	3194000	Um,
3194000	3195000	and we see Patille
3195000	3196000	and three other girls
3196000	3197000	sitting in the park
3197000	3198000	by candlelight talking.
3198000	3199000	And I go,
3199000	3200000	hey,
3200000	3201000	nice to see you guys.
3201000	3202000	We're going back,
3202000	3203000	going to bed,
3203000	3204000	cause I had to wake up early
3204000	3205000	for some reason.
3205000	3206000	Um,
3206000	3207000	I can't remember why.
3207000	3208000	I had to wake up early.
3208000	3209000	I was upset at Marie
3209000	3210000	for making me stay up so late.
3210000	3211000	You know,
3211000	3212000	I was like,
3212000	3213000	I had to,
3213000	3214000	he promised me
3214000	3215000	to get to bed before,
3215000	3216000	and I had to do extra shit
3216000	3217000	for something.
3217000	3218000	So she says,
3218000	3219000	okay,
3219000	3220000	don't worry,
3220000	3221000	let's just have a quick talk
3221000	3222000	with Patille
3222000	3223000	and talk about the day.
3223000	3224000	So,
3224000	3225000	you know,
3225000	3226000	okay,
3226000	3227000	fine.
3227000	3228000	But that quick talk with Patille
3228000	3229000	means she's going to talk
3229000	3230000	to you at you for an hour.
3230000	3231000	You know,
3231000	3232000	and of course,
3232000	3233000	I'm,
3233000	3234000	and Marielett does it,
3234000	3235000	so I'm the one that says,
3235000	3236000	okay,
3236000	3237000	enough,
3237000	3238000	I've got to go to sleep.
3238000	3239000	Right?
3239000	3240000	I'm going to have to be the asshole.
3240000	3241000	So I say,
3241000	3242000	okay, fine.
3242000	3243000	She comes into our place
3243000	3244000	for the first time.
3244000	3251000	In our entrance living room, we have a loft, there's an upstairs, back room, there's a whole bunch of fucking space.
3251000	3255000	And I'm like, okay, great, let's just go outside and smoke a cigarette and have a go.
3255000	3257000	She says, okay.
3257000	3263000	Go outside and we're underneath now my surveillance camera, okay?
3263000	3267000	And I have a 30-day fucking break point.
3267000	3276000	Marie is typing a letter now to send to LogiCircle to get this fucking tape because this will change everything.
3276000	3283000	Patille and we're smoking a cigarette and Patille goes on a tirade about how much she sees evil in Steve.
3283000	3287000	I looked in his eyes and all I saw was pure evil.
3287000	3289000	You know, like they're really dramatic.
3289000	3291000	I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.
3291000	3295000	She's like really, she gets in my face like, I don't really, I got in his eyes and I saw nothing.
3295000	3297000	It was blank. It was evil.
3297000	3301000	I said, no, Patille, what you saw was emptiness. There's just nothing in there.
3301000	3303000	He's not very smart.
3303000	3305000	She was, no, no, no, it was evil.
3305000	3309000	This was our conversation for like a good 15 minutes, right?
3309000	3317000	So not only are we confident that Patille hates Steve, you know, that she's not going to sell us out or do anything stupid.
3317000	3320000	We were like, okay, she's, you know, we believe her.
3320000	3325000	But, you know, I don't realize and I'm stupid because I forgot this is classic bipolar.
3325000	3327000	That's what I picked up on.
3327000	3329000	This woman is fucking classic bipolar.
3329000	3336000	And I've seen this so many times and I was dumb to not listen to my instinct that first day when I knew something was wrong.
3336000	3337000	I didn't know what it was.
3337000	3339000	I didn't think about it hard enough.
3339000	3342000	I think that's where I fucked up because that's what she is.
3342000	3348000	And now I see it because they flip one extreme to the next and that's exactly what happened.
3348000	3352000	Now in her report, she says she reached out to Steve via Instagram.
3352000	3353000	Not true.
3353000	3355000	They have, she's got a phone number.
3355000	3356000	Okay.
3356000	3365000	She wrote a report because we stopped seeing her after this because also there was something she was fucking dancing naked with Marlowe, supposedly.
3365000	3369000	Marlowe says she was dancing, but she may or may or not have been naked.
3369000	3371000	So Marlowe doesn't really understand.
3371000	3373000	He's going either way.
3373000	3374000	Right.
3374000	3376000	So I don't know what that means with Marlowe, but I don't like it.
3376000	3378000	He said he felt uncomfortable.
3378000	3379000	He tried not to look.
3379000	3383000	All he said, all I wanted to do was finish making the jewelry and she wanted to dance.
3383000	3386000	So that was enough for us to think this is enough of this.
3386000	3387000	Okay.
3387000	3388000	We put him in camp the next day.
3388000	3391000	He goes to a beach day camp for the next two weeks.
3391000	3393000	Now we don't hear from Patel for a long time.
3393000	3394000	We think something's wrong.
3394000	3396000	Why is she like say hello?
3396000	3400000	We don't see because she's not voice person friendly.
3400000	3405000	Then we get hit with Steve's lawyers.
3405000	3408000	Like a dossier.
3408000	3412000	They send like a thing saying here are the witness statements I have.
3412000	3413000	Why yours is a terrible person.
3413000	3415000	Here's why I'm great.
3415000	3417000	Not quite enough to do.
3417000	3421000	It's like an aggregate.
3421000	3428000	Yeah, summary of what she wanted and other people saying that me is a terrible person.
3428000	3440000	I want to say July 30th approximately July 30th.
3440000	3447000	So we see this and what we read is so fucking outrageously crazy.
3447000	3457000	She said that Marlowe is walking around without a shirt barefoot and is combing through garbage for fucking food.
3457000	3458000	Seriously.
3458000	3460000	He's going through dumpster for food.
3460000	3462000	And he says Marie is doing the same thing.
3462000	3464000	Or sorry, she says Marie is doing the same thing.
3464000	3469000	And then she says that Marie is walking around itching and scratching with sores all over her body.
3469000	3470000	A classic junkie.
3470000	3475000	She named every single drug in the world from fucking crystal meth that PCP did.
3475000	3477000	Some exotic crazy shit.
3477000	3480000	You remember in the heart of, you know.
3480000	3486000	She says that there is a secret hidden room in her loft where all the drugs are stored in the paraphernalia.
3486000	3487000	Okay.
3487000	3496000	She says I have 40, I'm not exaggerating, 40 to 50 cell phones scattered on the tables.
3496000	3498000	Okay.
3498000	3500000	Not fucking exaggerating.
3500000	3501000	And it's even worse.
3501000	3502000	They're worse crazy shit.
3502000	3504000	But those are the ones I remember right now.
3504000	3508000	And we're like what the fuck.
3508000	3511000	You know, and immediately I think that Steve paid her.
3511000	3512000	He had to pay her.
3512000	3515000	But this is before I figured out the bipolar thing.
3515000	3518000	What is the lawyer asking for?
3518000	3520000	They want nothing.
3520000	3521000	The lawyer said nothing.
3521000	3523000	This is like a tactic.
3523000	3527000	At this point you guys are full custody.
3527000	3531000	Well, see the custody arrangement as far as I understand it.
3531000	3533000	Again, I'm not a lawyer and I've never been through it.
3533000	3538000	But since they're still married they both have equal rights to Marla.
3538000	3540000	But no one has any, there are no rules set.
3540000	3543000	So it was a verbal agreement to say 50-50 for a year.
3543000	3547000	So when Marie said no 50-50 it was perfectly legal for her to do that.
3547000	3552000	And then she felt bad and she thought well maybe I should give him to,
3552000	3555000	and also we could want it some time alone after a couple months or like,
3555000	3557000	maybe we should give him to Steve for like a month,
3557000	3558000	or sorry, for a week.
3558000	3560000	And then our lawyer said no.
3560000	3563000	Because there was no rule to stop him from keeping Marla.
3563000	3566000	You know, just as you did he can do the same.
3566000	3568000	So we're like okay, so we keep him.
3568000	3572000	So when we see this thing from Utila it just freaks us out.
3572000	3573000	Like what the fuck.
3573000	3576000	And then DCFS comes over.
3576000	3578000	And I never heard of DCFS.
3578000	3581000	I don't know what the acronym stood for.
3581000	3584000	I'm sure I was visited by them as a child.
3584000	3587000	Because it seems like I remember something.
3587000	3590000	I did have a social worker I remember.
3590000	3594000	But the first woman that came over was named Priscilla.
3594000	3596000	And she was very nice.
3596000	3599000	She came over and she, I let her in which is stupid.
3599000	3602000	And I realized now you should never let them in if they ever come to your house.
3602000	3604000	It's a thing you can take.
3604000	3606000	They can never take away a child if you don't let them in.
3606000	3608000	That's what I was told by Laura.
3608000	3609000	But she came in.
3609000	3610000	She viewed the house.
3610000	3611000	It was safe.
3611000	3612000	It was loving.
3612000	3613000	It was fun.
3613000	3615000	It was a good fucking home.
3615000	3616000	And she reported that.
3616000	3617000	Okay.
3617000	3623000	Now Marie said to her in her interview that there was an incident that she was worried about.
3623000	3625000	And I remember very well.
3625000	3628000	We came home from shopping one day.
3628000	3632000	And Marlo just starts telling us like a confession.
3632000	3638000	This crazy story about touching penises at the Mark and Bobax house.
3638000	3641000	These people that sort of turned on Marie.
3641000	3643000	They were friends of Marie.
3643000	3645000	And then some reason they were not.
3645000	3648000	They just turned and then chose Steve's side.
3648000	3650000	Because people would need divorce.
3650000	3651000	People would pick sides.
3651000	3652000	It's shitty.
3652000	3654000	People are fucking shitty.
3654000	3656000	You call someone a friend.
3656000	3658000	I mean, it really hurt her.
3658000	3659000	It really hurt her.
3659000	3664000	And the things they said were so fucking ridiculous and stupid.
3664000	3668000	Anyway, it's the...
3668000	3670000	What was the point of that?
3670000	3671000	Sorry.
3671000	3672000	I need some more coffee.
3672000	3675000	I'm talking too much about coffee.
3675000	3676000	Okay.
3676000	3679000	So what was it just before that?
3679000	3681000	Oh, DCLA.
3681000	3683000	So what comes to the house?
3683000	3685000	She says, are you willing to take drugs to us?
3685000	3688000	And we say, yes, you're willing to take drugs to us.
3688000	3689000	Great.
3689000	3692000	We don't hear back from her for about three or four days.
3692000	3694000	Actually, we've never heard back from her.
3694000	3696000	That was the last we saw at Priscilla.
3696000	3698000	Next thing we know, police are at the door.
3698000	3700000	This is actually the second time police came.
3700000	3702000	They came before Priscilla came.
3702000	3703000	And then they came.
3703000	3705000	Then Priscilla and then the police came again.
3705000	3707000	And then...
3707000	3709000	No, this is Sabah Abta.
3709000	3711000	And Erasmo...
3711000	3713000	Aguilera.
3713000	3715000	Aguilera.
3715000	3717000	Not Aguilera, but Aguilera without the A.
3717000	3718000	Those are not the police?
3718000	3719000	Those are not the police.
3719000	3720000	These are more DCFS.
3720000	3721000	DCFS?
3721000	3722000	Yeah.
3722000	3725000	And now it's 10.30 at night and they're coming knocking door at 10.30 at night.
3725000	3727000	And so, Marie's not home.
3727000	3728000	She's at Amy's.
3728000	3730000	And she's all under your camera.
3730000	3733000	She'll put it on YouTube or something like that.
3733000	3735000	And they are...
3735000	3738000	You know, first they wake up Marlon.
3738000	3739000	They're banging on the door.
3739000	3740000	And Marlon was asleep.
3740000	3741000	I was asleep.
3741000	3743000	Because I woke up fucking early to the trade options.
3743000	3745000	You know, like 6 o'clock, 6.30.
3745000	3747000	The market's open at 6.30.
3747000	3749000	I have to be awake and ready at 6.30 a.m.
3749000	3751000	So, you know, I'm half asleep.
3751000	3752000	And Marlon's like,
3752000	3753000	Someone's at the door.
3753000	3754000	Someone's at the door.
3754000	3755000	I'm like, Marlon, why aren't you asleep?
3755000	3756000	You're supposed to be asleep.
3756000	3757000	They woke me up.
3757000	3758000	They woke me up.
3758000	3759000	It's okay.
3759000	3760000	So I go out and I open the door.
3760000	3761000	And I see...
3761000	3762000	And I say, where's DCFS?
3762000	3763000	We're going to talk to you.
3763000	3765000	I'm like, I just spoke to you guys.
3765000	3766000	You were just here, you know?
3766000	3768000	And he's like, well, you got another call.
3768000	3769000	And I'm like, fucking...
3769000	3771000	And I know it's Patel calling every day.
3771000	3773000	Patel and Steve's together calling every day.
3773000	3774000	Just to fuck with us.
3774000	3775000	You see where they can get.
3775000	3776000	I know it.
3776000	3777000	You know?
3777000	3778000	And they know it too.
3778000	3780000	So I'm like, you know, I'm just sort of sick of it.
3780000	3782000	I don't really want to do this anymore.
3782000	3783000	But I talk to them.
3783000	3784000	We have a conversation.
3784000	3785000	I'm very friendly.
3785000	3786000	You know, I'm not...
3786000	3788000	I don't give them any shit.
3788000	3790000	And they just...
3790000	3793000	I don't remember legally if they...
3793000	3795000	If I invited them or they just walked in the house.
3795000	3797000	So they ended up getting in the house.
3797000	3799000	I don't remember saying, yeah, go ahead, please.
3799000	3800000	Come in for another round.
3800000	3801000	But they did.
3801000	3802000	And they did the rounds.
3802000	3804000	And we joked and we laughed.
3804000	3805000	Now, here's...
3805000	3806000	No.
3806000	3807000	This is where I...
3807000	3808000	We broke down.
3808000	3810000	Marie and I have been doing this for three days.
3810000	3811000	Like, nonstop.
3811000	3813000	Working on this thing that you guys sent.
3813000	3815000	You know, breaking every single word by word,
3815000	3816000	every line by line.
3816000	3817000	Where the lies are and what we can prove.
3817000	3819000	We have documentary evidence for it when we don't.
3819000	3820000	Right?
3820000	3822000	For example, she says, I knocked on the door
3822000	3825000	and took about ten minutes to come to the door.
3825000	3828000	It took two minutes and thirty-two seconds.
3828000	3829000	Okay?
3829000	3831000	Two minutes and thirty-two fucking seconds.
3831000	3833000	She says, we went through the house.
3833000	3834000	There was no food in the refrigerator.
3834000	3835000	It was scarce.
3835000	3838000	We had just ordered about three hundred and fifty-four hundred dollars
3838000	3839000	from Amazon delivery.
3839000	3840000	Fresh, direct.
3840000	3842000	To come fucking two guys full of...
3842000	3843000	car full of food.
3843000	3844000	It was overflowing.
3844000	3845000	We made jokes.
3845000	3846000	I joked them.
3846000	3847000	I said, look, ha!
3847000	3849000	Guess you can't say where you're going.
3849000	3850000	So we're starving him.
3850000	3852000	And we all laughed about it.
3852000	3854000	In the report, it says, scarce.
3854000	3856000	Those are just, like, too little things.
3856000	3858000	No, I'm not even getting into the big ones.
3858000	3860000	It was delivered the next day.
3860000	3861000	No, it was there.
3861000	3862000	It was already there.
3862000	3864000	The night before, we had got ordered it.
3864000	3866000	And we had packed up the fridge and the pantries.
3866000	3867000	All right?
3867000	3868000	It was like, what the fuck?
3868000	3870000	We couldn't believe what we were reading.
3870000	3873000	And if you read that thing, the first fourteen, fifteen pages are like,
3873000	3874000	okay, fine.
3874000	3875000	So it's normal.
3875000	3876000	Nothing's wrong here.
3876000	3881000	And then we become, like, the worst people you've ever heard.
3881000	3883000	It's like fucking crazy shit.
3883000	3887000	And somehow, I don't give her the number.
3887000	3889000	She has Tim's number.
3889000	3891000	How the fuck does she get Tim's number?
3891000	3893000	And she says, and there's a little note at the end,
3893000	3896000	because she's trying to discredit me as much as she can.
3896000	3898000	And you can see that it's really hard.
3898000	3900000	Worse than David Enridge did at The New York Times.
3900000	3901000	Like, really come after me.
3901000	3902000	But I don't understand.
3902000	3905000	I'm what I did to anger her.
3905000	3909000	I have a recording, because I've learned to record pretty much everything.
3909000	3912000	You know, it's smart, because no way people can fuck with you.
3912000	3915000	And another question, why?
3915000	3917000	Like, I am.
3917000	3918000	I'm joking.
3918000	3921000	I'm just going to steal it from your cloud later.
3921000	3927000	But what was I saying?
3927000	3931000	I recorded her saying, well, obviously, you know, the house is great.
3931000	3934000	Obviously, Marlo loves you and you love Marlo.
3934000	3936000	It's not, you know, you guys are great.
3936000	3939000	Just, we want you to take a drug test, and that's it.
3939000	3941000	And I'm like, okay, that's it.
3941000	3943000	I agreed.
3943000	3946000	And then I said, and then there's another phone call later,
3946000	3949000	because the next day, four police officers came.
3949000	3952000	And that's where I was just, I had enough.
3952000	3954000	I'm like, look, more fucking police officers.
3954000	3957000	Ed, this is the fourth day in a row, and you're still doing this.
3957000	3959000	At what point is this harassment?
3959000	3962000	This is like a few weeks ago.
3962000	3963000	Yeah.
3963000	3967000	Oh, this is much, what's today the 12th?
3967000	3969000	So today, yeah, we're in August now.
3969000	3971000	We're in August.
3971000	3973000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3973000	3977000	I was looking at the footage last night again.
3977000	3979000	It was July 29th.
3979000	3981000	This must be the 30th now.
3981000	3984000	30th or August 1st, right around there.
3984000	3986000	Yeah, I think so.
3986000	3988000	Because the police came the next day, so it must be the 30th.
3988000	3990000	How many days are in July?
3990000	3992000	July 31.
3992000	3995000	So it's 30th or 31st.
3995000	3998000	Yeah, yeah.
3998000	4000000	I didn't even know.
4000000	4003000	I didn't even know.
4003000	4007000	I had zero ideas when I asked.
4007000	4010000	So, yeah.
4010000	4012000	So all of this stuff that's happening,
4012000	4016000	is that what was court on, what was it, on Monday?
4016000	4017000	No, no, no.
4017000	4020000	It gets worse.
4020000	4024000	It gets worse when you get to what happens on Sunday.
4024000	4027000	So I'm like, I say, Savva, look,
4027000	4028000	and I read her this email.
4028000	4031000	I said, look, nothing personal against you.
4031000	4033000	You seem like a good person.
4033000	4037000	I just, I'm tired of everyone of you guys believing this woman
4037000	4041000	and accepting this as fact and not even investigating the caller.
4041000	4043000	Clearly, this woman is out of her mind.
4043000	4046000	And how can you not delineate saying from insane,
4046000	4048000	I think that's your job, but I didn't say it like that.
4048000	4049000	I said it very kindly.
4049000	4050000	I have a copy of it.
4050000	4051000	I supported you.
4051000	4054000	And I said, look, I'm just going to say we'll do the drug test,
4054000	4055000	but that's it.
4055000	4056000	We're going to put our foot down.
4056000	4058000	We're not going to do anything else after the drug test.
4058000	4059000	All right.
4059000	4061000	We're just going to, we're not going to, we're going to stop.
4061000	4064000	So you tell us what the next move is and we will oblige.
4064000	4065000	And that I can quote.
4065000	4067000	I mean, I said that tell us what the next move is
4067000	4068000	and we will oblige.
4068000	4070000	That's a quote, right?
4070000	4073000	And then I didn't hear from her.
4074000	4080000	And then Tuesday of that week, we interviewed a clean lady.
4080000	4085000	She came to us from, see, I still think Patel sent her this woman
4085000	4089000	because I asked Patel, do you know anyone that it will clean and babysit?
4089000	4092000	Because I feel bad that you, I don't want you to think
4092000	4095000	we're sending Marla over to your place to babysit.
4095000	4096000	Okay.
4096000	4099000	So I was trying to overcompensate by saying,
4099000	4101000	please give me the name and number of a fucking babysitter.
4101000	4103000	You know, so that way she wouldn't think that.
4103000	4105000	You know, so I still suspect it came from her,
4105000	4107000	but Marie thinks it came from somebody else.
4107000	4109000	So I don't know.
4109000	4111000	But she called us and said, I heard you're looking for a babysitter.
4111000	4114000	And I said, yes, we are, but also a cleaning lady too.
4114000	4116000	Like you need to be able to clean.
4116000	4118000	So she says, I can do that.
4118000	4119000	And so we meet her on Tuesday.
4119000	4122000	I honestly have no memory of this meeting.
4122000	4124000	But Marie says we met on Tuesday.
4124000	4125000	I don't know.
4125000	4126000	I don't remember it.
4126000	4130000	I mean, briefly, I remember saying, okay, thank you, shaking a hand.
4130000	4133000	But I don't know, maybe because I didn't sleep much the night before.
4133000	4135000	Cause I mean, it's really weird when you don't sleep, you know,
4135000	4140000	and then, you know, cause I'll take a nap at like 130 when the market closes.
4140000	4143000	And then my mind will refresh itself.
4143000	4145000	But sometimes I don't get that nap.
4145000	4148000	So, but Marie showed me and she said, look, right here,
4148000	4151000	you can see the text between Lori and us.
4151000	4153000	She was here on Tuesday.
4153000	4155000	So she went back home and she came back on Friday.
4155000	4156000	And that was her first day.
4156000	4158000	She worked Friday and she was good.
4158000	4162000	And we paid her 80 bucks in the center on Saturday.
4162000	4164000	She comes back, but she comes late.
4164000	4165000	Okay.
4165000	4167000	She is like very late.
4167000	4169000	And she says, I went to the dentist and had an abscess.
4169000	4172000	And she showed pictures to prove it that she was at the dentist.
4172000	4173000	I said, okay, fine.
4173000	4176000	So she does all the cleanser of the kitchen,
4176000	4180000	does all the dishes and does the sheets, half the sheets of laundry.
4180000	4182000	It takes Marla with her.
4182000	4184000	One interesting thing happened.
4184000	4187000	Marla was freaked out in the laundry room.
4187000	4190000	And he said to his mom and friends that she,
4190000	4193000	Lori turned white and really white.
4193000	4195000	And he thought she was going to die.
4195000	4196000	This is Marla.
4196000	4197000	So he was very scared for her.
4197000	4198000	And we sat her down.
4198000	4199000	We asked her, are you okay?
4199000	4200000	She said, I'm fine.
4200000	4201000	I'm fine.
4201000	4202000	It's a COPD she has.
4202000	4205000	It's called, it's some sort of pulmonary thing.
4205000	4206000	I don't really know.
4206000	4207000	Apparently.
4207000	4208000	Yes.
4208000	4210000	Apparently she has machines at home.
4210000	4212000	She has a machine, like a little machine that helps her breathe.
4212000	4214000	Which I'm like, okay.
4214000	4217000	And she had a bunch of these things.
4217000	4219000	The inhaler.
4219000	4220000	And it's strange.
4220000	4221000	Everyone has an inhaler.
4221000	4223000	She knows, but there's a different looking one.
4223000	4224000	It's very odd.
4224000	4226000	And it has the date and a wheel.
4226000	4229000	So I don't know that much about that one.
4229000	4232000	She doesn't want to go home.
4232000	4233000	Okay.
4233000	4235000	She's like 60 years old, mid 60s actually.
4235000	4236000	Found out how old she was.
4236000	4239000	She was born in 1960.
4239000	4242000	So she's exactly 60 years.
4242000	4246000	And then the reason I did that math really quick is because I already knew the answer.
4246000	4247000	Okay.
4247000	4249000	I knew the answer.
4249000	4252000	So she starts crying.
4252000	4253000	At first it was a laugh.
4253000	4255000	I heard them both laughing upstairs and I said, what's so funny?
4255000	4256000	What's the joke?
4256000	4257000	I want to know the joke.
4257000	4258000	And I go, oh, you won't get it.
4258000	4259000	You're a man.
4259000	4260000	I'm like, oh, okay, fine.
4260000	4264000	And then I go to the bathroom and then I come out and the crying turned to sobbing.
4264000	4266000	Severe fucking sobbing.
4266000	4272000	She was hugging Marie and Marie looked at me like, you know, she also gave me like the
4272000	4273000	go away.
4273000	4274000	It's a girl thing.
4274000	4276000	You're not going to let me handle it.
4276000	4277000	It's okay.
4277000	4281000	So I go downstairs and Marie says, look, let's let her stay.
4281000	4282000	She doesn't want to go home.
4282000	4288000	So we'll put her up in the, we have in the little room at the top of the, if you see the layout,
4288000	4289000	come over.
4289000	4291000	You guys will see the layout for yourselves.
4291000	4295000	So she stays in the little room upstairs.
4295000	4298000	I don't think much too much about it.
4298000	4299000	It's not a big deal.
4299000	4302000	She wakes up, she takes a bath, which is odd.
4302000	4304000	You know, you don't do that.
4304000	4305000	It's a weird behavior.
4305000	4308000	She takes a bath and she starts cleaning again.
4308000	4310000	And we're like, okay, fine.
4310000	4311000	Clean again.
4311000	4313000	Sunday was the last, a third day anyway.
4313000	4315000	We did a three day trial and it was the final day.
4315000	4318000	So we knew she was gone for good no matter what on Sunday.
4318000	4320000	She's always going out to her car.
4320000	4321000	Okay.
4321000	4323000	Which I did not think was too suspicious.
4323000	4327000	I just thought she was going to join or something because she came back a little, you know,
4327000	4330000	different, but happy, always happy, not miserable.
4330000	4332000	And she would talk about her life a little bit.
4332000	4339000	She told us about her daughter in Italy and she married a very wealthy Italian guy.
4339000	4343000	And then it gets to be around 9.30, 10.
4343000	4346000	And I'm like, Marie, you handled the hours.
4346000	4348000	I don't, we're not going to pay her for the time she slept.
4348000	4349000	Right.
4349000	4350000	We're not paying her.
4350000	4351000	So you take care of this.
4351000	4352000	I don't want to deal with it.
4352000	4356000	I'm going to the number and I'll send her the money.
4356000	4358000	Marie goes, says, okay.
4358000	4361000	Next thing I'm in my office area.
4361000	4363000	Marie is not hit with her.
4363000	4366000	She comes in and says, I'm really tired.
4366000	4370000	Do you mind if I lay down for a few minutes before I drive home?
4370000	4372000	And I say, sure, fine, no problem.
4372000	4377000	So she's wearing like a jacket getting ready to, she's ready to leave.
4377000	4380000	And then I look at her and like, she's actually ready to leave.
4380000	4381000	It's good.
4381000	4382000	Take a nap.
4382000	4383000	Go for it.
4383000	4384000	She lies down.
4384000	4385000	She doesn't wake up.
4385000	4389000	She dies.
4389000	4392000	She fucking died on her bed.
4392000	4394000	She's fucking dead.
4394000	4395000	Like fucking dead.
4395000	4396000	Right.
4396000	4401000	And the only reason I knew she was dead was later because I mean, I thought she was alive
4401000	4405000	because at any moment I thought she was going to pop up and we're pushing her and stuff like that.
4405000	4409000	And I tried to feel for a pulse and I sort of remember what to do.
4409000	4412000	And I swear to God, I felt the pulse and there was warmth in her wrist.
4412000	4418000	And it was, unless I was feeling my own pulse in my fingers, which people do that too.
4418000	4419000	I don't know.
4419000	4425000	But it wasn't until she, like, I don't know anything about it.
4425000	4429000	I mean, I saw my father dead, but I never saw that this happened.
4429000	4434000	Like her face turned, it was like a bruise color.
4434000	4436000	It was a purplish.
4436000	4437000	It was not natural.
4437000	4442000	And that's when we knew, like, holy shit, this woman is dead.
4442000	4446000	And now it's fucking scary.
4446000	4448000	So we were freaked out.
4448000	4450000	Marla did not see anything.
4450000	4451000	He was asleep.
4451000	4452000	He was asleep.
4452000	4454000	He's got his little treehouse room on the other side of the wall.
4454000	4455000	Oh, thank you.
4455000	4456000	Of course.
4456000	4457000	Jesus.
4457000	4458000	I mean, we didn't want him walking in either.
4458000	4462000	So at all times, I had someone had to be in front of that door just in case he came down.
4462000	4467000	Like, yeah, he doesn't want some more Cheerios, you know, kind of like TV.
4467000	4470000	But of course, this morning, Marla, you can watch all the TV you want.
4470000	4472000	You go upstairs and you watch TV.
4472000	4474000	This is TV morning, right?
4474000	4477000	You watch as much as you want.
4477000	4483000	And Marie called the ambulance.
4483000	4485000	And then all hell broke loose, man.
4485000	4486000	Is it?
4486000	4487000	The ambulance came.
4487000	4491000	And what we learned later from the report, because it's in the report,
4491000	4496000	was that, supposedly, Sabah, Sabah, hate with a B, having to,
4496000	4502000	was talking to Patel at 9.30 a.m. in the morning on a Monday, which is weird.
4502000	4508000	Because Patel did not, she either did not sleep in that before or this is all a lie.
4508000	4509000	Okay.
4509000	4514000	And calls and says, holy shit, there's an ambulance going to Val's and Marie's.
4514000	4515000	Come over now.
4515000	4516000	And then she calls Steve.
4516000	4518000	And Steve comes over.
4518000	4520000	So LAPD is there.
4520000	4522000	The ambulance people are there.
4522000	4524000	Steve is there.
4524000	4525000	Patel is there.
4525000	4528000	And not only is she there, but she is screaming at him.
4528000	4531000	He's calling us murderers, saying profanities.
4531000	4533000	Throwing fucking rocks.
4533000	4536000	Throwing fucking rocks.
4536000	4537000	All right.
4537000	4539000	That's how fucking crazy she is.
4539000	4543000	Not only did she show up, but all the people that hate us in the building are there.
4543000	4545000	Just like really enjoying this.
4545000	4547000	Not in the building, but the campus.
4547000	4549000	And there's a, there's three or four of them.
4549000	4551000	You know, and one of them is the management.
4551000	4553000	We're in a huge fight with the management.
4553000	4555000	A woman named Ashley Madison.
4555000	4556000	Ashley Madison.
4556000	4557000	Ashley Madison.
4557000	4558000	Ashley Madison.
4558000	4559000	Ashley Madison.
4559000	4561000	Oh, no, no, no.
4561000	4563000	I didn't hack that.
4563000	4566000	Actually, something, she's just a pain in the ass.
4566000	4572000	And she decided, oh, can I just tell you, police officers that Val, we always thought Val was on drugs.
4572000	4574000	We always thought Marie was on drugs.
4574000	4576000	And Bob, Bob, Bob.
4576000	4577000	Okay.
4577000	4580000	And she, and then this guy named Stosh.
4580000	4586000	And I'll tell you, he's like one of these people that always wished he was a Marine, you know, the types.
4586000	4590000	They're like, they wear like the clothes, like they pretend that they were served in Vietnam.
4590000	4593000	And they pretend they served in Afghanistan, but they never did anything.
4593000	4595000	And they never even left their town.
4595000	4597000	And he works at the building too.
4597000	4600000	He opens the door for the cars, basically.
4600000	4602000	He's like a dormant for cars.
4602000	4606000	But the attitude, and he's very, he's got this racist fucking thing too.
4606000	4608000	And he was there too.
4608000	4611000	And he said, excuse me, officer, I would like to talk to you in person a little longer afterwards.
4611000	4613000	Yeah, I know exactly.
4613000	4614000	He's just going to talk shit about me.
4614000	4616000	And I just was like, what the fuck is happening?
4616000	4619000	The film crew that's following me around, they came.
4619000	4622000	And they said, there was so much animosity in the air.
4622000	4626000	They said, we knew, and we don't want to tell you this, but we feel like this was the whole setup.
4626000	4627000	This was planned.
4627000	4629000	Like there was people, there was evil there.
4629000	4631000	There was something hatred there for you.
4631000	4633000	Yeah, yeah.
4633000	4634000	My name's Rocco.
4634000	4635000	It wasn't obviously not now.
4635000	4638000	And I've been told about this, Adore.
4638000	4642000	But Rocco Castoro, he was the former editor-in-chief of Vice.
4642000	4644000	And he's doing a documentary.
4644000	4646000	No.
4646000	4647000	Sorry?
4647000	4649000	Yeah, I think I saw it on YouTube.
4649000	4650000	Oh, you didn't?
4650000	4651000	It's on?
4651000	4652000	Formerly.
4652000	4653000	Yeah.
4653000	4654000	Sorry, you have a new channel.
4654000	4660000	Yeah, anything with some other, some dude named Tim Pool, which I don't know him,
4660000	4661000	but I heard bad things.
4661000	4664000	So I'm trying to distance myself from that name, is what I've been told.
4664000	4667000	It's like, well, whatever you do, don't associate yourself with that name.
4667000	4670000	But he's financing this project for some reason.
4670000	4674000	Yeah, trying to recreate Vice magic.
4674000	4675000	Exactly.
4675000	4677000	He was fired, actually.
4677000	4678000	Yeah.
4678000	4683000	It was the way he tells the sexual harassment thing that they were covering up in HR.
4683000	4686000	And it was a whole mess, because the sexual harassment was from wines,
4686000	4689000	the head of HR worked for Harvey Weinstein as well.
4689000	4691000	This is a whole fucking mess.
4691000	4694000	It's like a real fucking crazy shit.
4694000	4699000	Anyway, don't believe everything Rocco says, because he exaggerates and bellishes a lot.
4699000	4702000	But he did say, like, we were not welcome.
4702000	4704000	They told us to leave right away.
4704000	4707000	And not dating the police, the building.
4707000	4710000	So they had to take all this stuff and go.
4710000	4713000	And then Marie also said, I felt like we were set up.
4713000	4718000	I felt like, how did the fuck did Sabah already have a court date ready on the back of her car when she came?
4718000	4719000	How is that possible?
4719000	4721000	How did she have that court date for Monday?
4721000	4723000	And I was like, I don't know.
4723000	4725000	I don't know how DCFS works.
4725000	4728000	Apparently, the due process is not a thing there.
4728000	4730000	There's no such thing as due process.
4730000	4732000	They can do whatever the fuck they want.
4732000	4734000	And that is fucking terrifying.
4734000	4737000	And if you read that report and you were me, you would see.
4737000	4741000	If you could see from my point of view, which I don't know if you'll be able to because you're not me.
4741000	4746000	You don't know what I'm like and what Marie's like and Marla's like and Patel and Steve.
4746000	4750000	It's fucking terrifying that this is in the public record.
4750000	4754000	And there's a judge that yesterday, the judge heard this.
4754000	4756000	And I'm sorry.
4756000	4759000	I'm scared to have Hava, the social worker.
4759000	4760000	She comes.
4760000	4762000	Marie is fucking in tears.
4762000	4763000	She is crying.
4763000	4765000	She's inconsolable.
4765000	4768000	She is barely in our reality at this point.
4768000	4770000	And this woman comes up to her and says,
4770000	4772000	so did you kill her?
4772000	4773000	So was it an overdose?
4773000	4774000	Are you drugs?
4774000	4775000	Yeah?
4775000	4776000	Tell me how many drugs did you do today?
4776000	4778000	And she's like this.
4778000	4779000	Right there.
4779000	4785000	And Marie is just uncontrollably sobbing, telling her to fuck off as nice as she possibly can.
4785000	4786000	But she's answering the question.
4786000	4788000	She's like, no, of course not.
4788000	4789000	Where's the cleaning supply?
4789000	4790000	Show me the cleaning.
4790000	4793000	And the LAPD would not let her in the house.
4793000	4794000	So that was good.
4794000	4796000	They wanted this woman out there.
4796000	4803000	Now, I have some footage of her screaming at Marie because the security camera did get a pretty good view of it.
4803000	4806000	I have not gone through any yet because I've been going through all this other shit.
4806000	4808000	I will do that later today.
4808000	4811000	And I'll find out exactly what the fuck happened.
4811000	4813000	Now, everything was fine.
4813000	4815000	And the coroner, we had to wait for the coroner.
4815000	4819000	And the coroner comes in and he's like, he comes in like a superstar.
4819000	4821000	He's like, everyone's waiting for the coroner.
4821000	4822000	He shows up.
4822000	4823000	He's like, well dressed, well groomed.
4823000	4825000	He's like, hey guys, I'm here.
4825000	4828000	And I was like, OK, good.
4828000	4829000	Interesting.
4829000	4831000	He was like a personality, which was strange and interesting.
4831000	4833000	And then the whole mood changed.
4833000	4837000	And all suspicions toward me just sort of dissipated.
4837000	4842000	And the guy did his job and he was very thorough.
4842000	4844000	And he said, Val, here's the case number.
4844000	4846000	Any questions you call me?
4846000	4852000	I'm sorry to tell you, but when people die, there's a blood barrier thing in your nose.
4852000	4854000	And the blood drips out the nose.
4854000	4856000	So there's blood on the bed.
4856000	4859000	I was like, no, OK, it's disgusting.
4859000	4862000	He said, you're probably going to want to get rid of the sheets.
4862000	4863000	I was like, yes.
4863000	4864000	They will take them for us.
4864000	4867000	They can take the fucking sheets, man.
4867000	4872000	But Saba, during this time, takes Marlowe and gives him the Steve
4872000	4875000	and decides that Marlowe cannot be with us.
4875000	4876000	She makes this decision.
4876000	4877000	She's screaming at Marie.
4877000	4879000	Marie is inconsolable and she takes Marlowe.
4879000	4884000	She does not tell Marie, OK, until later.
4884000	4888000	And then Marlowe, and if Marie comes to me, I'm inside talking to police officers.
4888000	4889000	She took them.
4889000	4890000	They took Marlowe.
4890000	4891000	They took Marlowe.
4891000	4892000	So I start running out there.
4892000	4895000	I get to the fucking park and I see Marlowe and he's sitting down.
4895000	4899000	I see Saba and they're going about to approach Marlowe.
4899000	4900000	I see Steve behind her.
4900000	4901000	Just fucking.
4901000	4903000	Steve's so sick, he's smiling.
4903000	4904000	He's fucking grinning.
4904000	4906000	He's fucking smiling.
4906000	4907000	He's so happy about this shit.
4907000	4908000	And I go there.
4908000	4909000	I say, you're not taking Marlowe.
4909000	4910000	No.
4910000	4911000	You're not taking Marlowe.
4911000	4914000	I get between her and Marlowe and I say, no.
4914000	4915000	Marlowe just comes with me.
4915000	4916000	He grabs my hand.
4916000	4917000	OK.
4917000	4918000	And Steve is not like this.
4918000	4920000	Saba is fucking upset.
4920000	4922000	And she goes, it's like this.
4922000	4924000	It makes me work hard.
4924000	4926000	It's sort of the sigh.
4926000	4931000	And then she walks over to the police officer and tells him something.
4931000	4932000	He comes over.
4932000	4934000	It's like, you have to release the child now.
4934000	4936000	You have to let him go now.
4936000	4938000	I don't even know who this woman is.
4938000	4939000	She comes here.
4939000	4940000	I don't even see a badge.
4940000	4941000	I have no paperwork.
4941000	4943000	I have his card with court date on it.
4943000	4944000	OK.
4944000	4945000	Nothing.
4945000	4946000	Do you see a badge around her?
4946000	4947000	She's just a social worker.
4947000	4948000	She's not a fucking officer.
4948000	4951000	And the guy says, listen, you have to let go of the child now.
4951000	4952000	So I'm like, OK.
4952000	4953000	So Marlowe is going to be fine.
4953000	4954000	We'll figure it out.
4954000	4955000	Don't worry.
4955000	4956000	Et cetera.
4956000	4957000	Steve takes him off.
4957000	4958000	Takes him away.
4958000	4959000	And we haven't seen him since.
4959000	4962000	Now, we get this fucking shitty lawyer.
4962000	4965000	Here's a problem.
4966000	4967000	Sorry.
4967000	4968000	It's so convoluted.
4968000	4969000	But I just want to make sure you got it.
4969000	4970000	I want to be thorough.
4970000	4971000	Right?
4971000	4973000	I don't want to miss any details.
4973000	4974000	This is important.
4974000	4983000	Marie is so upset that she doesn't care a woman just died on the bed.
4983000	4987000	She gets a blanket and just goes on the bed and sleeps.
4987000	4988000	And I'm like, wow.
4988000	4990000	I didn't think she had that in her.
4990000	4993000	I was like, there's some coldness in her.
4993000	4995000	I'm like, Marie, use that coldness.
4995000	4996000	Later I am.
4996000	4997000	You've got to use that now.
4997000	4999000	You cannot lose your shit like you did today with Salva.
4999000	5001000	Because she was screaming and crying.
5001000	5004000	And Marie's not a weak woman.
5004000	5007000	But something happened at that moment.
5007000	5010000	The woman really worked her.
5013000	5018000	And then we immediately called this woman named Dorothy Gibbons White.
5018000	5026000	And she is a lawyer that represented a famous friend of Marie's that was an NCIS actress named Zoe.
5026000	5030000	And she did the most horrendous thing that he could do.
5030000	5031000	But you know what?
5031000	5032000	She fucking fights dirty.
5032000	5037000	She accused the husband of Zoe of being a child rapist.
5037000	5041000	Like raping the son, Sebastian, every day for like a year or something.
5041000	5042000	And I'm like, wow.
5042000	5043000	Let's fuck that.
5043000	5044000	And Marie's like, fuck that.
5044000	5045000	I don't think it's true.
5045000	5046000	I'm like, what?
5046000	5048000	And I'm like, I don't think it's true.
5048000	5049000	Like really?
5049000	5051000	It's like, we've got to get this woman.
5051000	5053000	You need to fucking hire her.
5053000	5054000	Because now we're so pissed off.
5054000	5056000	We need someone to fight dirty.
5056000	5057000	So we call her.
5057000	5060000	And she says, you know, Sebastian got off.
5060000	5062000	But he was held for four months in Kentucky.
5062000	5065000	The police caught him trying to go across state lines.
5065000	5066000	The FBI was involved.
5066000	5067000	It's a thing.
5067000	5068000	He really is this dirty.
5068000	5069000	And we start to believe her more.
5069000	5070000	And we want to believe her.
5070000	5071000	Right?
5071000	5072000	Because we want her help.
5072000	5074000	Because we know that she fights dirty.
5074000	5075000	We want some of the fucking women.
5075000	5076000	And I'm here at any cost.
5076000	5077000	Whatever the fucking cost is.
5077000	5078000	We want Marlo.
5078000	5079000	You know?
5079000	5081000	And she starts saying, does Steve ever hang out with JP?
5081000	5085000	JP is the name of the guy that's this child rapist.
5085000	5087000	And so he was the wife.
5087000	5091000	So if you look at the internet, if you Google those two names,
5091000	5094000	you'll see the story.
5094000	5098000	And as a matter of fact, Steve is friends with this guy, JP.
5098000	5101000	And all gravitates around this fucking school called Lila.
5101000	5104000	And the guy that's the head of that school is named Nordeem.
5104000	5108000	I filed a police report on him in May for being way too handsy
5108000	5111000	with Marie and all the women at that fucking school
5111000	5112000	and the children.
5112000	5115000	Because he is grabbing them, hugging them, everybody.
5115000	5116000	He's very handsy.
5116000	5117000	And it's a French thing to do.
5117000	5118000	I get it.
5118000	5119000	But we're not fucking friends.
5119000	5120000	All right?
5120000	5122000	And Marlo doesn't like it.
5122000	5124000	He does not like it when the guy grabs his fucking shoulder
5124000	5125000	all the time and rubs his back.
5125000	5126000	He doesn't like it.
5126000	5129000	And I tell Marlo, well, tell him not to do it.
5129000	5130000	You know?
5130000	5131000	If I'd see him, I'll fucking tell him.
5131000	5132000	But I've never seen him do it.
5132000	5133000	Marlo tells us.
5133000	5135000	So I was pissed off.
5135000	5138000	And on top of that, this guy says to Marie right to email,
5138000	5140000	Marie wants to have a meeting with the teacher
5140000	5142000	because we're worried about Marlo's work
5142000	5144000	because he wasn't doing his math and work.
5144000	5145000	He's lying to us about it.
5145000	5147000	And she wanted to set up a meeting.
5147000	5149000	And Nordeem said, he's the head guy.
5149000	5153000	The guy that's too handsy says, Marie.
5153000	5155000	He's the principal.
5155000	5156000	He's the principal.
5156000	5157000	Yeah.
5157000	5161000	He says, Marie, I would go, but you have to go.
5161000	5163000	I'll tell you when the meeting will be.
5163000	5164000	And Steve is going to be there.
5164000	5165000	And Marie says, I'm not.
5165000	5167000	I can't be in a room with Steve.
5167000	5169000	I do not want to be meeting with Steve.
5169000	5170000	I'll do my own meeting.
5170000	5171000	Steve can do it.
5171000	5172000	I have his own meeting.
5172000	5174000	And then he says, and I shit you not, Marie,
5174000	5176000	if you don't go to the meeting with your husband,
5176000	5178000	I will call Child Services on you.
5178000	5179000	In an email.
5179000	5181000	And we have that email.
5181000	5182000	OK.
5182000	5184000	And then that's when I lose my shit.
5184000	5186000	And I fucking call the police.
5186000	5187000	I said, this guy's harassing us.
5187000	5188000	He's being fucking handsy.
5188000	5190000	He just threatened my girlfriend.
5190000	5192000	And what he does with the kids is fucking strange.
5192000	5195000	Now, take that completely unrelated.
5195000	5200000	I had no idea that Dorothy Gibbons White, the prosecutor,
5200000	5202000	also had a file on this guy.
5202000	5205000	Apparently, there is something fucking weird shit going on down there.
5205000	5207000	How much of it is real?
5207000	5208000	I don't know.
5208000	5209000	How much of it is fake?
5209000	5210000	I don't know.
5210000	5212000	Because she is, again, fights dirty.
5212000	5215000	But she blends fiction with fact, but she does it well.
5215000	5218000	And I can't even fucking tell the truth anymore.
5218000	5220000	So I don't care at this point.
5220000	5221000	Maria doesn't care.
5221000	5224000	We're going to have to go to that level and accuse Steve
5224000	5226000	of hanging out with a known fucking kiddie fiddler.
5226000	5228000	How to file.
5228000	5231000	If that's what's going to win, then let's just fucking do it.
5231000	5232000	So she says, all right.
5232000	5235000	But here she says, and I have, and I'm
5235000	5237000	happy if you guys want to take this further and go for it.
5237000	5239000	Because I have, I recorded all of it.
5239000	5242000	So you have her on tape saying to Marie,
5242000	5245000	do you think Marlo, could you get Marlo to say this?
5245000	5247000	Could you get him to say this?
5247000	5248000	She's like, probably.
5248000	5249000	Yeah.
5249000	5251000	This is what we need Marlo to say.
5251000	5252000	And Marlo's eight.
5252000	5255000	She's fucking saying that on the phone.
5255000	5258000	She says, if I were you, it was my family,
5258000	5261000	I would want Mike Kratzmer to represent me.
5261000	5262000	It's like a mafia down there.
5262000	5264000	But he's in the mafia, but he's like a spy.
5264000	5265000	He's a good guy.
5265000	5266000	I'm like, OK.
5266000	5268000	So that's the guy we call.
5268000	5270000	He immediately wants $15,000.
5270000	5272000	And he is a fucking piece of work.
5272000	5275000	And he's the worst lawyer I've ever fucking seen.
5275000	5278000	He's the one that reached out to jamming
5278000	5279000	and said he was representing me.
5279000	5280000	All right.
5280000	5281000	No, there's one thing I missed.
5281000	5283000	I thought it was $15,000.
5283000	5285000	No, we did not.
5285000	5287000	No, not at all.
5287000	5288000	Fuck yeah.
5288000	5290000	That's $700 an hour for three days of work.
5290000	5292000	And what he did on Monday was nothing.
5292000	5296000	He did not say a fucking, he did not defend us.
5296000	5299000	He said, I don't even have to show up on the camera.
5299000	5300000	OK.
5300000	5301000	Just Marie's going to sit there.
5301000	5303000	So I set up this whole thing with lights,
5303000	5304000	beautiful.
5304000	5306000	And you have to call him.
5306000	5308000	Yeah, you have to call him.
5308000	5309000	Yeah.
5309000	5311000	And a proper camera with a proper lens.
5311000	5312000	So she looked good.
5312000	5314000	Like everyone else was looking good, right?
5314000	5316000	But the lawyer, no, he fucked up.
5316000	5317000	Sent us a link at the last second.
5317000	5318000	And she had to do it from her phone.
5318000	5320000	It looked terrible.
5320000	5322000	And we were the only ones, or she was the only one
5322000	5323000	holding the phone.
5323000	5324000	Everyone else was at their computers.
5324000	5325000	Well-dressed.
5325000	5326000	Everything looked good.
5326000	5329000	And Marie's, we just looked unprepared.
5329000	5332000	And Clumsy Inn just, it was terrible.
5332000	5334000	And the lawyer did not defend us.
5334000	5336000	He did not say that none of this is true.
5336000	5338000	He didn't say that the teal was crazy.
5338000	5340000	He didn't say that Steve was using this as a tool for anything.
5340000	5342000	He just said one thing.
5342000	5345000	He said, all I ask is that the child is not sleeping
5345000	5347000	in the same bed as the father.
5347000	5349000	And I say, oh shit, I know who he's going for.
5349000	5353000	I know who he's building up, what he's going to build up to.
5353000	5355000	But he doesn't defend us.
5355000	5358000	And that's when I start losing, then I start texting him
5358000	5359000	and say, what are you doing?
5359000	5361000	You didn't put anything into evidence.
5361000	5365000	You didn't mention anything about all these disdainless litany
5365000	5366000	things I've sent him.
5366000	5368000	And he just screams at me and tells me,
5368000	5369000	I'm not listening to him.
5369000	5370000	I don't know what I'm doing.
5370000	5372000	If I was a brain surgeon, would you tell a brain surgeon
5372000	5373000	what to do?
5373000	5374000	You know, et cetera, et cetera.
5374000	5375000	And then it was just-
5375000	5377000	Did you submit a brief to the court?
5377000	5378000	I don't know.
5378000	5379000	We don't even have it.
5379000	5381000	As far as I know, he submitted nothing.
5381000	5383000	He said he didn't give the court anything.
5383000	5386000	He just asked the late, did you read the documents?
5386000	5388000	And she says, not yet, give me a few minutes.
5388000	5390000	That's all I remember.
5390000	5391000	And then she read the documents.
5391000	5393000	And then she said, I want to see this guy dial.
5393000	5396000	Because I'm painting out to be this controlling, fucking asshole
5396000	5400000	that is like, you know, Marie is too weak to speak for herself.
5400000	5404000	And Marie is so fucking sick of hearing from men telling her
5404000	5406000	how weak she is that she needs another man to speak for her.
5406000	5408000	Like, if you guys don't ever tell that to her,
5408000	5409000	because she's slacking.
5409000	5410000	All right.
5410000	5412000	But that's how she's painted out, not only by Steve,
5412000	5413000	but by everybody.
5413000	5414000	All right.
5414000	5418000	And now I am the controlling Spangali that is controlling her.
5418000	5419000	For what purpose?
5419000	5420000	I don't know.
5420000	5422000	You know, it's not like she has money.
5422000	5423000	There's nothing I want.
5423000	5424000	I'm trying to get for her.
5424000	5426000	But apparently this is what I'm painting out.
5426000	5427000	There's one more important thing after that.
5427000	5428000	It's where I forget.
5428000	5430000	It's really important.
5430000	5435000	Lori, the woman, she took out the garbage once.
5435000	5437000	I wish there was one more than one.
5437000	5440000	But there was this one time, I think it was Saturday.
5440000	5442000	There were three of that.
5442000	5443000	Lori's the one who passed the law.
5443000	5444000	Yes.
5444000	5445000	Yes.
5445000	5449000	But three different bags of black garbage.
5449000	5451000	And I wasn't, this is told to me by Marie.
5451000	5452000	It's the second hand.
5452000	5455000	Marie will tell you the full story, much better than me.
5455000	5457000	And Marie felt something was wrong.
5457000	5459000	Something suspicious, because she was watching the bags
5459000	5461000	from upstairs, which she thought was great.
5461000	5463000	So Marie said, I'll just take these bags out.
5463000	5465000	And Marie and Lori was trying to tell her,
5465000	5467000	no, don't do what I'll do.
5467000	5468000	And she's like, no, that's okay.
5468000	5469000	I'll take them out.
5469000	5471000	And I think Marlowe goes with her.
5471000	5472000	I don't remember.
5472000	5473000	She goes outside.
5473000	5474000	She opens the garbage.
5474000	5479000	And in Garbage Bag A are my files from when
5479000	5482000	I was in Cook County, foster care.
5482000	5485000	It's a stack of this big that I got when David was
5485000	5486000	doing my background.
5486000	5489000	And so we got all this stuff from Cook County in Chicago.
5489000	5491000	And it's a huge stack of papers of my own,
5491000	5494000	tired childhood, in the misery of it all.
5494000	5496000	Included in that is a notebook that I wrote in,
5496000	5502000	like poems and songs from when I was like 16 or 17.
5502000	5504000	And there was another screenplay that was really
5504000	5506000	terrible, shitty screenplay, but I don't know
5506000	5507000	why she chose that.
5507000	5509000	But you had to go to get this file.
5509000	5511000	You had to know where they were.
5511000	5512000	They were in my library.
5512000	5515000	And you have to go and scrap them.
5515000	5517000	It was not something that was accessible.
5517000	5520000	Now bag number two was the same thing,
5520000	5521000	but for Marlowe.
5521000	5523000	It was Marlowe's school assessments,
5523000	5525000	all the teacher assessments, all his grades,
5525000	5527000	everything he's ever gotten from school.
5527000	5530000	It's all in this one dossier sort of thing.
5531000	5535000	In the third bag, there wasn't anything interesting.
5535000	5537000	She said there was, there might have been something,
5537000	5540000	but not like this, something else.
5540000	5542000	And so Marie flipped out, you know,
5542000	5543000	what this means.
5543000	5545000	I still don't know what this means.
5545000	5546000	It's very strange.
5546000	5547000	So she was taking out the trash,
5547000	5549000	but it hadn't gone all the way yet?
5549000	5550000	No.
5550000	5552000	Well, she was going to steal it.
5552000	5554000	So she was pretending, this is how she was going
5554000	5556000	to get the papers out in the garbage cans,
5556000	5559000	in the garbage bags, and then pretend that she was...
5560000	5562000	Yes, yes, this stage.
5562000	5565000	And that's why maybe she was going to her car all the time.
5565000	5567000	And we found out that she did steal some shit from us,
5567000	5572000	which is funny enough, the Crystal Jewelry.
5572000	5575000	I shit she not, I shit she not.
5575000	5578000	She stole the fucking Crystal Jewelry that Marlowe made.
5578000	5579000	Yes.
5579000	5580000	Okay.
5580000	5582000	So that's the short version.
5583000	5584000	Yeah?
5585000	5586000	Cleaning up.
5586000	5587000	Cleaning up.
5587000	5588000	Yeah, and then I got...
5588000	5590000	Actually, yesterday, I got a text from Rocco,
5590000	5592000	who's the guy...
5592000	5593000	The film...
5593000	5594000	The film...
5595000	5599000	Yeah, the ex-Vice News guy.
5599000	5601000	He said...
5601000	5603000	He did some background on Lori,
5603000	5605000	and he said that she was...
5606000	5607000	Rocco.
5607000	5608000	Okay.
5608000	5612000	It's Lori Roth, date of birth, 117, 1960.
5612000	5614000	She has an extensive criminal history,
5614000	5617000	breaking and entering, distribution and trespassing.
5617000	5619000	If your neighbor was watching Marlowe
5619000	5621000	and claiming he had bruises around the times,
5621000	5623000	we were shooting, I can refute that with footage.
5623000	5624000	Okay, let's...
5624000	5627000	Yeah, she claimed that he had bruises and a black eye.
5627000	5629000	That Marlowe had a fucking black eye.
5629000	5630000	Never.
5630000	5631000	Never.
5631000	5632000	Never.
5632000	5633000	Never.
5633000	5635000	He never had bruises other than falling off his bicycle.
5635000	5637000	You know, his scraped knee.
5638000	5641000	What did the judge finally decide on Monday?
5641000	5642000	The judge said...
5642000	5643000	The judge said, okay, great.
5643000	5645000	So, I want to see this Val person.
5645000	5646000	Can we please see Val?
5646000	5648000	And so, he recalls me and I sit down.
5648000	5649000	I don't say a word,
5649000	5651000	because our lawyer says, don't talk.
5651000	5653000	So, I listen to the lawyer.
5653000	5654000	And she looks at me.
5654000	5656000	There's a pause for like three or four seconds,
5656000	5658000	and she says, I'm going to recommend
5658000	5661000	that the child does not see Val Brooksman at all
5661000	5664000	and has minimum visits with the mother.
5664000	5665000	Minimum visits.
5665000	5666000	Minimum.
5666000	5668000	Like, the bare minimum that they have to...
5668000	5669000	The minimum.
5669000	5672000	They could give away a few hours, three days a week.
5672000	5673000	You know?
5673000	5675000	Is there a deadline that someone not acquires
5675000	5676000	or wouldn't go back to court?
5676000	5677000	Nope.
5677000	5678000	We had no paperwork.
5678000	5679000	We did nothing.
5679000	5680000	I had no paperwork from anyone.
5680000	5682000	No one from fucking DCF asked.
5682000	5683000	From the courts.
5683000	5684000	Nothing.
5684000	5686000	Can you tell me on September 29th,
5686000	5687000	you guys have the follow-up hearing
5687000	5689000	where they'll make a more firm decision?
5689000	5690000	Or is that...
5690000	5691000	Yeah.
5691000	5693000	So, on September 15th,
5693000	5695000	I thought that was the court,
5695000	5696000	that if it's not,
5696000	5700000	it's when the investigator has to hand in his paperwork.
5700000	5703000	And then the next trial date is the 29th.
5703000	5706000	And if there's no amicable decision made,
5706000	5708000	October 1st is the real trial,
5708000	5709000	like a trial trial,
5709000	5711000	where people will get witnesses,
5711000	5713000	like the television or something.
5713000	5714000	Okay.
5714000	5716000	So, yeah.
5716000	5717000	So that's...
5717000	5718000	All right.
5718000	5720000	The short version.
5720000	5721000	It's pretty crazy.
5721000	5722000	It's like the cop said,
5722000	5723000	he's like,
5723000	5725000	you got hit with a double wham.
5725000	5727000	A double wham.
5727000	5729000	And that's been stuck in my head ever since.
5729000	5731000	He was very right.
5731000	5735000	He was a double fucking triple wham.
5735000	5736000	Sorry.
5736000	5737000	I'm sorry.
5737000	5739000	Speak my language.
5739000	5740000	How often does that film feature,
5740000	5742000	you know, sector guys?
5742000	5743000	Not often.
5743000	5744000	Not anymore.
5744000	5745000	So they've filmed...
5745000	5748000	So David Enrich,
5748000	5749000	you know,
5749000	5751000	he tried to get a film deal
5751000	5752000	during this whole thing,
5752000	5753000	very unethical,
5753000	5754000	and he held on to...
5754000	5756000	You probably don't want to hear any of this shit,
5756000	5757000	but I'll tell you anyway,
5757000	5758000	because it's so fucking political.
5758000	5759000	If you're like Tim and Jim,
5759000	5760000	you don't want to hear it.
5760000	5762000	But Trump has these loans
5762000	5763000	with Deutsche Bank, right?
5763000	5764000	And David sat on them
5764000	5765000	for a very long time.
5765000	5766000	And I'm like,
5766000	5767000	why did you sit on them?
5767000	5768000	He said,
5768000	5769000	well, Deutsche Bank told me they were fake.
5769000	5770000	I'm like, no.
5770000	5772000	You listen to Deutsche Bank told me.
5772000	5774000	He has a deal set up with Deutsche Bank.
5774000	5776000	It's kind of Eurgen.
5776000	5777000	I forgot his last name,
5777000	5779000	but he's the head of the PR.
5779000	5780000	It's a, you know,
5780000	5781000	scratch on my back,
5781000	5782000	I'll scratch yours.
5782000	5783000	And for example,
5783000	5784000	with Tom Bowers,
5784000	5785000	remember Tom Bowers?
5785000	5786000	Tom Bowers was
5786000	5788000	Rosemary Vibraleck's boss
5788000	5790000	at DBTCA.
5790000	5791000	Rosemary Vibraleck
5791000	5792000	was Trump's private banker
5792000	5793000	at Deutsche Bank.
5793000	5795000	So he died.
5795000	5797000	His death was very suspicious.
5797000	5798000	It was suicide.
5798000	5799000	He hung himself in Malibu.
5799000	5800000	It was similar to my father.
5800000	5803000	Very similar.
5803000	5804000	And then the coroner,
5804000	5806000	there was a huge problem with the body.
5806000	5808000	We couldn't get the police report
5808000	5810000	because the body had melted
5810000	5812000	mysteriously on Christmas Day
5812000	5814000	and they shipped it to Virginia
5814000	5815000	for some reason.
5815000	5817000	And that's, so we can't,
5817000	5818000	it's cause of death,
5818000	5820000	no one can tell anyone.
5820000	5822000	Very fucking weird, right?
5822000	5824000	Of all the bodies in the world,
5824000	5825000	of all the deaths in the world,
5825000	5826000	this is death.
5826000	5830000	That is, no evidence.
5830000	5831000	It's just fucking strange.
5831000	5832000	And that was the last time
5832000	5834000	I spoke to Jim and Tammy as well.
5834000	5835000	I bring up Tom Bowers
5835000	5838000	because, why do I bring up Tom Bowers?
5838000	5841000	Oh, because he knows about the lungs, right?
5841000	5843000	That was David's source.
5843000	5846000	And I know that can be a whole mean source.
5846000	5849000	And then when he died,
5849000	5850000	David tweeted out,
5850000	5851000	it was a sad day,
5851000	5852000	Tom Bowers died today.
5852000	5853000	He said, he's a good man.
5853000	5854000	He's got a family, sir.
5854000	5856000	He left out the most important bit,
5856000	5858000	suicide, right?
5858000	5859000	Because he has to deal with
5859000	5860000	Deutsche Grange.
5860000	5862000	They said, do not imagine the suicide.
5862000	5864000	So it was myself and Scott Steadman.
5864000	5866000	I told Scott about it.
5866000	5867000	And Scott is a,
5867000	5869000	he's like a Twitter,
5869000	5870000	forensic music,
5870000	5872000	he runs this thing called forensic music.
5872000	5873000	It's like a Twitter phenomenon.
5873000	5874000	It's like 20 years old,
5874000	5876000	he's got a million followers.
5876000	5877000	Because he handles
5877000	5878000	the Trump-Russia thing really well.
5878000	5879000	So I tell him this story
5879000	5880000	and he gets on.
5880000	5882000	He's a genius with public information.
5882000	5883000	He finds anything in the public domain
5883000	5885000	and he gets the cause of death.
5885000	5888000	And then we do a story about the cause of death.
5888000	5890000	And now we're in a battle against David.
5890000	5891000	As I've always,
5891000	5893000	as I've been since that fucking article came up.
5893000	5895000	Sorry, that's,
5895000	5896000	I don't know why
5896000	5897000	it felt that was important
5897000	5898000	for you guys to know.
5898000	5899000	So you said David was,
5899000	5902000	you began by saying David was sitting on the,
5902000	5903000	sitting on the wall.
5903000	5904000	Yeah.
5904000	5905000	The Trump bill, you know.
5905000	5906000	But then,
5906000	5907000	forensic news,
5907000	5908000	did they have their own?
5908000	5909000	I mean, I guess the,
5909000	5911000	the George Bank of data,
5911000	5913000	seems like you shared it with Tim,
5913000	5915000	with Tim and more?
5915000	5916000	I did.
5916000	5917000	I gave it to Tim and Jeremy.
5917000	5918000	And then,
5918000	5920000	David also had a copy of it.
5920000	5921000	No, I never,
5921000	5922000	I never gave David a full,
5922000	5923000	I would never,
5923000	5924000	I do not,
5924000	5925000	you know,
5925000	5926000	I gave him a doc,
5926000	5928000	a selective amount of documents.
5928000	5929000	But then,
5929000	5931000	he's had the Trump data.
5931000	5932000	No.
5932000	5933000	No, no, no.
5933000	5934000	So how did,
5934000	5935000	how did David know about it?
5935000	5936000	Tell him about it.
5936000	5937000	Okay.
5937000	5941000	Now, if you remember,
5941000	5942000	there was a guy,
5942000	5943000	he's a pundit,
5943000	5945000	he's like a liberal-ish,
5945000	5946000	not Chris Matthews,
5946000	5947000	but,
5947000	5949000	I can't remember his name.
5949000	5950000	But he went on the air one,
5950000	5951000	one night and said,
5951000	5952000	ladies and gentlemen breaking news,
5952000	5954000	I have the Trump loan documents,
5954000	5956000	from the Russian banks.
5957000	5959000	And they are very well,
5959000	5961000	very much exactly what you thought,
5961000	5962000	you guys all thought.
5962000	5963000	Stay tuned,
5963000	5964000	et cetera, et cetera.
5964000	5965000	Next day,
5965000	5966000	he says,
5966000	5967000	ladies and gentlemen,
5967000	5969000	I have to retract my statement,
5969000	5970000	from the other night.
5970000	5972000	I don't have them.
5972000	5974000	Turns out they were fraudulent.
5974000	5975000	And so,
5975000	5976000	what the fuck.
5976000	5977000	And Deutsche Bank's lawyer
5977000	5979000	has got ahold of this guy.
5979000	5980000	He's a famous name,
5980000	5981000	I just can't,
5981000	5982000	it's not coming to my mind.
5982000	5983000	And told him that
5983000	5984000	these are fraudulent documents
5984000	5985000	and if you go,
5985000	5986000	you're gonna fucking see the shit out of you,
5986000	5988000	you're never gonna work again.
5988000	5989000	And that's what you got scared
5989000	5991000	and backed out.
5991000	5993000	Now there are some fraudulent documents
5993000	5994000	out there,
5994000	5995000	I've seen them on Scribd.
5995000	5996000	They're terrible,
5996000	5997000	frauds,
5997000	5998000	but these aren't the ones.
5998000	6000000	These are different documents.
6000000	6002000	Fraudulent documents are more...
6002000	6003000	Not in my data set.
6003000	6005000	Not just Deutsche Bank.
6005000	6006000	Well,
6006000	6009000	my data set's grown substantially
6009000	6010000	since 2014,
6010000	6012000	but it's not from my data set.
6016000	6017000	Please.
6017000	6019000	It's like no one's talking about
6019000	6023000	the best way that we can help people.
6023000	6025000	There's a couple options right now
6025000	6027000	that we already have to talk about a little bit
6027000	6029000	as far as the investigator goes, right?
6030000	6032000	What are the allegations against you?
6032000	6033000	I mean, I know we've talked about all of them,
6033000	6035000	but you have like some where you've,
6035000	6037000	like if you see the lack of food
6037000	6039000	and you have cell phones everywhere.
6039000	6041000	Yeah, I don't really know what the allegations are,
6041000	6043000	other than drug addicts.
6043000	6045000	You know, but it's easy to call them drug addicts.
6045000	6047000	I am very open about my past.
6047000	6048000	Right.
6048000	6050000	You know, I've taken drugs.
6050000	6051000	It's a big deal.
6051000	6052000	You're not undergoing now,
6052000	6054000	because you said you know a drug test.
6054000	6055000	Yes.
6055000	6056000	So that should be,
6056000	6057000	that should probably solve itself, right?
6057000	6058000	It should, but it doesn't.
6058000	6059000	It didn't,
6059000	6060000	because then the,
6060000	6062000	our lawyers just don't take any drug tests,
6062000	6063000	don't talk to them if they call,
6063000	6064000	you hang up.
6064000	6065000	If they're at the door,
6065000	6066000	you don't open it.
6066000	6067000	They're like, okay, fine.
6067000	6069000	Do you recommend that safe thing?
6069000	6070000	I don't know.
6070000	6071000	Well,
6071000	6072000	he's the lawyer.
6072000	6073000	I just decided,
6073000	6074000	he knows more than me.
6074000	6075000	So I trust him,
6075000	6076000	blindly,
6076000	6077000	until yesterday.
6077000	6078000	My,
6078000	6079000	my,
6079000	6081000	so that's what I did.
6081000	6082000	And that was stupid of me.
6082000	6083000	Very fucking stupid of me.
6083000	6084000	And Marie did the same thing.
6084000	6086000	And if I had not trusted him,
6086000	6088000	Marie would not have trusted him.
6088000	6089000	Does Marie also get a drug test
6089000	6090000	after her work you said?
6090000	6091000	Yes,
6091000	6092000	randomly.
6092000	6093000	Yes.
6093000	6094000	I would imagine that.
6094000	6095000	It wouldn't be a huge issue,
6095000	6097000	because if Marie already got a drug test,
6097000	6099000	there would be one after the last.
6099000	6100000	Right.
6100000	6102000	And it's perfectly okay to go with your own doctor,
6102000	6104000	because you don't trust these DCF people
6104000	6106000	and give your own fucking drug test.
6106000	6107000	You're overseen by doctor,
6107000	6108000	and your doctor will hand it to you.
6108000	6109000	That's fine too.
6109000	6110000	I read it online.
6110000	6112000	But the Saba woman would not allow that.
6112000	6113000	She didn't want that.
6113000	6114000	And I also said,
6114000	6115000	no,
6115000	6116000	Saba,
6116000	6117000	and I have it on the table.
6117000	6118000	Saba,
6118000	6119000	I said I was willing to take a drug test.
6119000	6120000	I didn't say I was going to be there
6120000	6121000	at 3.30
6121000	6122000	and Beverly Hills
6122000	6123000	on fucking Friday.
6123000	6124000	That I did not say.
6124000	6125000	It was,
6125000	6126000	well,
6126000	6127000	you know that if you don't take a test,
6127000	6128000	it's going to,
6128000	6130000	that means that you are called,
6130000	6131000	quote, dirty,
6131000	6132000	they call it.
6132000	6133000	Well,
6133000	6134000	that's a,
6134000	6135000	well,
6135000	6136000	you know that's a bunch of bullshit.
6136000	6137000	It's a lie.
6137000	6138000	Why would you do that?
6138000	6139000	That's just the way it is.
6139000	6140000	Can she get what you want
6140000	6141000	in Beverly Hills?
6141000	6142000	She said anytime between nine
6142000	6143000	and five
6143000	6144000	on a Friday,
6144000	6145000	on Friday,
6145000	6146000	yes,
6146000	6147000	in Beverly Hills.
6147000	6148000	Okay.
6148000	6149000	And then I was,
6149000	6150000	we're both ready to go
6150000	6152000	until Thursday night
6152000	6153000	before police come.
6153000	6154000	Okay.
6154000	6155000	And then we're pissed off.
6155000	6156000	And we're like,
6156000	6157000	you know what?
6157000	6158000	I'd help that Mike
6158000	6159000	recommend not.
6159000	6160000	Yes.
6160000	6161000	Yes.
6161000	6162000	So it's like,
6162000	6163000	you know,
6163000	6164000	we weren't even supposed to call her
6164000	6165000	and say no,
6165000	6166000	we're just,
6166000	6167000	but we picked up the phone
6167000	6168000	or stupidly even talked to her.
6168000	6169000	But this woman is,
6169000	6170000	it's like,
6170000	6171000	something's wrong.
6171000	6172000	Something's really wrong.
6172000	6173000	We don't know what it is.
6173000	6175000	I know what I don't know,
6175000	6177000	which is a substantial.
6177000	6179000	Are you guys,
6179000	6181000	do you guys know anything even,
6181000	6182000	that I don't know?
6182000	6183000	What can you help me with this?
6183000	6184000	What is happening?
6184000	6185000	I don't know.
6185000	6186000	I don't know.
6186000	6187000	I don't know.
6187000	6188000	I have no idea.
6188000	6189000	No one's told me anything.
6189000	6190000	Even Mike,
6190000	6191000	the lawyer is supposed to be
6191000	6192000	the greatest ever.
6192000	6193000	He doesn't,
6193000	6194000	he told me shit.
6194000	6195000	He fired him.
6195000	6196000	That's right.
6196000	6197000	Interesting.
6197000	6198000	Do you guys have things
6198000	6199000	for another lawyer?
6199000	6200000	Well,
6200000	6201000	that's what I was going to find
6201000	6202000	out today.
6202000	6203000	See what you guys can do.
6203000	6204000	And if you could save us,
6204000	6205000	you know,
6205000	6206000	you know,
6206000	6207000	I don't know.
6207000	6208000	I don't know.
6208000	6209000	I don't know.
6209000	6210000	I don't know.
6210000	6211000	I don't know.
6211000	6212000	I don't know.
6212000	6213000	I don't know.
6213000	6214000	If you could save us,
6214000	6215000	you know,
6215000	6216000	$15,000,
6216000	6217000	it would be great.
6217000	6218000	But I'm trying,
6218000	6220000	I have to gauge what you can do
6220000	6221000	to see if I need a lawyer.
6221000	6222000	That's why I'm
6222000	6224000	making this right now.
6224000	6225000	So not only you're gauging me,
6225000	6228000	but I'm gauging this.
6228000	6229000	It's a tough call.
6229000	6230000	Like,
6230000	6231000	we're not going to send
6231000	6233000	an FBI lawyer to represent me.
6233000	6234000	Right.
6234000	6236000	The things we can do,
6236000	6237000	I mean,
6237000	6238000	if there's a question of money,
6238000	6239000	sometimes we can
6239000	6240000	get you some money.
6240000	6241000	But obviously I can't.
6241000	6242000	We have,
6242000	6245040	You know, obviously, we're not wealthy, but we can do this.
6245040	6246440	Yeah, remember what you were saying,
6246440	6248160	and I mean, you've missed your wealth yourself.
6248160	6249560	You said trade didn't end one time.
6249560	6252960	Yeah, I mean, I've lost more than you made, but yeah, I got it.
6252960	6256160	You know, don't tell, don't tell Mary.
6256160	6258160	You're doing the last few more.
6258160	6264000	Actually, that's probably my best, when crisis, time, and crisis.
6264000	6265920	So there's that type of stuff.
6265920	6269360	The other thing that we talked about, too, is we have to keep
6269360	6270600	our relationship secret.
6270600	6272680	Yeah, that's the only way that we can do it.
6272680	6276320	So if, you know, I call a shop, stop, or something like that,
6276320	6279880	and say, hey, we've got the deal, so we'll tell you why you want to know.
6279880	6280240	Sure.
6280240	6282320	You have to stay small on it, right?
6282320	6285840	So our relationship with you is going to be limited in scope, right?
6285840	6289560	Like we talked about, it's likely going to be something where, you know,
6289560	6290320	it's going to be something.
6290320	6293840	You know, I look at electronic cigarette thing, I just can't believe it.
6293840	6295800	Are you going to know all this smoke, electronic?
6295800	6296720	Really? Inside?
6296720	6298520	It's just, but it's not real.
6298520	6301680	I'm not aware of it.
6301680	6308240	So the main thing that we would call it, the main thing that we would be able to
6308240	6311040	help with is, like, everything's going well, right?
6311040	6313120	We can't change what's going on in the past, right?
6313120	6317440	Because we can't change what, you know, Isala said, or what your neighbors have
6317440	6318240	said, or anything.
6318240	6319440	Sure, right.
6319440	6323040	But going forward, we can help you with the investigator, right?
6323040	6325640	Because the investigator is going to assess you and Marie to see if you
6325640	6326920	get the two full parents.
6326920	6330960	So those are things that we can help with.
6330960	6333800	I'm trying to think there are other avenues that would like you.
6333800	6334920	I made a whole list of stuff.
6334920	6337160	I've been studying law for like a week, okay?
6337160	6340200	I'm not a lawyer, but I figured there's some things that they've done very
6340200	6341720	illegally, all right?
6341720	6345120	Due process still exists, even in that court, all right?
6345120	6347920	Even though some lawyers say no, some lawyers say yes, it does exist.
6347920	6353080	We read online on reputable law websites.
6354040	6356200	They're not supposed to invite themselves in and walk in.
6356200	6357720	They did.
6357720	6367240	This woman is clearly, the lies are so ridiculously, too many lies.
6367240	6374000	And the only reason for that is to paint a picture because you have an agenda.
6374000	6375800	Why, why she has this agenda?
6375800	6378920	Why she wants to destroy me or Marie?
6378920	6381840	I don't know, I mean, I get it.
6381920	6384240	I've encountered people like this before.
6384240	6386640	I don't know why they do it, but they want to do it.
6386640	6389640	It's either, Marie always says I'm going to kill this, you know?
6389640	6391160	I don't think it's jealousy.
6391160	6392200	I think it's something else.
6392200	6396520	I don't know what it is, but there's some reason that she wants us destroyed.
6396520	6401920	And she, and you have to, what I've learned is that this system,
6401920	6405520	just the DCFS, is very corrupt.
6405520	6407200	There's some, they know each other.
6407200	6409640	It's ancestral, they all know each other.
6409640	6415280	This guy that worked there, our lawyer and customer, he was threatening Marie.
6415280	6419000	Okay, when we left, he fucking threatened her and said, you know what?
6419000	6422560	If you don't get a vow, because I was calling him out, I said, why didn't you do this?
6422560	6427440	If you don't get a vow to stop acting like a bully and know everything,
6427440	6430600	you're going to have to make a choice between your son and Val.
6430600	6432560	We have that on tape, too.
6432560	6434560	You got to hear this fucking, too.
6434560	6435560	It's crazy.
6435560	6437320	Okay.
6437640	6442520	Full soldier, too, I've dealt with this and other cases that are similar to yours.
6442520	6444400	With DCFI?
6444400	6445600	With DCFI?
6445600	6446600	In Texas.
6446600	6447600	Oh, okay.
6447600	6448600	In some organizations.
6448600	6452440	But we don't, the thing is, I'm not an expert either, right?
6452440	6456200	We've worked with some things in the past that have been successful stuff,
6456200	6458200	and we actually got some good work out of it.
6458200	6459560	Everything turned out fine.
6459560	6460960	So that's my experience with it.
6460960	6465080	I'm not an expert in custody law and now across this work,
6465080	6466200	I learn something new every day.
6466200	6473320	So the primary issue I see is this, like, if we're going to help, right,
6473320	6478120	we're going to help and be effective in our job, but also be effective for you.
6478120	6485400	So trying to uncover a conspiracy with Saba makes it, like, I mean,
6485400	6489120	I don't think there's some weird stuff going on, but that's what I'm saying is that
6489120	6492080	if the investigator does his job properly or her job properly,
6492080	6495600	they should see that you guys are successful parents who can help raise Marlowe
6495600	6497000	in a very productive way.
6497000	6499280	But here's the thing.
6499280	6504560	Any competent person, whether you're a DCFS or a police officer,
6504560	6507960	anyone that is trained to deal with people,
6507960	6513200	can delineate a same person from an insane person, right?
6513200	6514840	You should be able to do that.
6514840	6521400	Now, when you meet Patel and you read her shit, she's obviously fucking nuts, right?
6521400	6524160	Sorry for this, but clinical terms, she's fucking nuts.
6524160	6525320	She's out there.
6525320	6531760	And for Saba, I know is able to determine the difference between saying and not saying.
6531760	6537440	So she purposely, I suspect that she's a smart person,
6537440	6540960	that she purposely included this woman's testimony for a reason.
6540960	6544680	She's against it, because she must know that she's fucking nuts.
6544680	6545680	They're using her.
6545680	6548360	It's sad for this woman.
6548360	6552640	I'm not that sympathetic for her anymore because she's did it, but it's, you know what I mean?
6553520	6554600	I'm not saying it's very simple.
6554600	6555920	It's the first time I've heard it.
6555920	6559680	So you're saying that she's clinically insane, right?
6559680	6561600	She's got a frontier bipolar.
6561600	6564320	Maybe not insane, but that's exaggeration.
6564320	6566240	Mentally unstable, for sure.
6566240	6567120	Classic bipolar.
6567120	6570240	I'm willing to bet you anything you'll find bipolar medication.
6570240	6572840	But just for reference, right?
6572840	6575560	We probably wouldn't want to make that claim, right?
6575560	6576920	You would, yes.
6576920	6578360	Or you would not.
6578360	6584040	Because if it's one, easy to tell that someone is clinically insane, and two,
6584040	6588280	you know that she's insane, and three, why would you give custody to her
6588280	6589960	for several hours a week?
6589960	6591000	Because we didn't know it at the time.
6591000	6591840	He just hurt himself, right?
6591840	6596800	So like, you know at the time, he's same argument to the lady with the investigation.
6596800	6601880	So that's an avenue I think would be dangerous for you than anything else, right?
6601880	6604560	So we get her to retract her statement.
6604560	6605240	Well, here's the thing.
6605240	6610120	So again, are we going to go over there and break her off to retract the statement?
6610120	6612520	Yeah, I'm ready to go to the Armenian.
6612520	6613920	I'm like, let's go find the Armenians.
6613920	6615040	They handle this shit, right?
6615040	6616560	Luckily, we're lucky for you.
6616560	6618200	The FBI doesn't do that, right?
6618200	6625520	I mean, we are on the side of good because we're not going to influence people in that way.
6625520	6626480	It's just not how we work.
6626480	6629080	And like I told you on phone, I'll be honest with you.
6629080	6632480	What we can and what we can't do, I'm not going to make a story for you to say like,
6632480	6635640	oh, we can turn the world around immediately for you right now.
6635640	6636440	No, I know.
6636440	6636960	I know.
6636960	6637800	I don't expect that.
6637800	6641880	But I'm trying to work with you to see what avenues we can best help with.
6641880	6648720	So like I said, the best thing I can think of right now is influencing how you're perceived.
6648720	6653360	And not in a negative way, not in a way that's illegal or anything, but just saying like,
6653360	6659760	hey, if you have these issues, if you have, they say, oh, there's not enough food in the house.
6659760	6664040	And then we just show receipts, you get an Amazon delivery every week or something like that.
6664040	6665720	Yeah, we have the receipts.
6665720	6670920	So all those things would be easily refuted by evidence that you can show.
6670920	6675520	And there's no evidence that the FBI is helping you or, you know, if we give you money to do that,
6675520	6677920	that's just cash that you have, right?
6677920	6682920	So all those things are ways that we can help your view in the court size.
6682920	6687720	Because what we talked about too and what we talked about on the phone is that it's very rare
6687720	6690680	that they take custody completely away from the parent.
6690680	6695080	It can happen in very extreme cases, but at least the ones that I've been involved in,
6695080	6696960	the judge almost always favors.
6696960	6700640	And what we talked about, the mom almost wouldn't have a father or whatever.
6700640	6702400	I believe that you believe that.
6702400	6706920	But what I've read and studied in the last few days about this specific system in Los Angeles
6706920	6708640	and these people, it's not that.
6708640	6709560	It's the opposite.
6709560	6710920	They give it to the perpetrator.
6710920	6716760	They give it to the person that has the most money or the person that's been doing the illegal fake calls.
6716760	6722560	Because this is, obviously you can imagine, this is a tool used in many, many divorces.
6722560	6724400	That's the complicated part of it.
6724400	6730000	And I have not experienced in this, but just, you know, you've had an experience in the past
6730000	6732160	and you've been like, this is complicated.
6732160	6737320	It's not just a child welfare situation, it's a divorce.
6737320	6738320	It's weaponized.
6738320	6740160	They weaponized DCFS for divorce.
6740160	6741960	It's terrible, but that's what's happening.
6741960	6742760	And they know it.
6742760	6744760	And they're using it and making a lot of money.
6744760	6747160	They're fucking lawyers and judges.
6747160	6752160	Like, for example, Sabah makes $120,000 a year.
6752160	6756280	Her supervisor makes 210 public records.
6756280	6758480	That's a lot of money for DCFS, right?
6758480	6760480	And they have the other $80,000.
6760480	6761520	What's other?
6761520	6762760	Where did that $80,000 come from?
6762760	6763920	Over time.
6763920	6764920	$60,000.
6764920	6766040	Over time.
6766040	6768800	And $25,000.
6768800	6770960	Other $90,000.
6770960	6772360	So what the fuck?
6774800	6776800	Is that normal?
6776800	6777800	I don't know, okay.
6777800	6781240	Anyway, I'm just saying it's suspicious to me.
6781240	6782600	But yeah, well, what can you do?
6782600	6783800	What can you do?
6783800	6787000	What is in your power and what's not?
6787000	6791880	We have to do some more research, because the issue is what we can do would make it
6791880	6793440	over it also, right?
6793440	6795920	Also, you don't have a rebuttal either.
6795920	6801320	We wrote it on the piece of paper, the FPVF thing with like these, then we put sticky
6801320	6804840	notes on the fake sticky notes on a digital thing.
6804840	6806360	Can't find it anywhere.
6806360	6810200	It only took two days to write it, and now we can't find the sticky notes.
6810200	6811200	We have to write it again.
6811200	6812200	So we will get you that.
6812200	6813200	We will get you that.
6813200	6818800	And I haven't uploaded all the evidence yet, like all the recordings that we have and
6818800	6827280	all the video recordings, audio and video.
6827280	6834040	So, the last time I checked the email address, I didn't see anything, but that was before
6834040	6835040	I left.
6835040	6836040	You didn't see anything?
6836040	6837040	No.
6837040	6838040	I sent it to you.
6838040	6842400	I sent it to that email address on Sunday night, and I checked on Monday to get anything
6842400	6843400	yet.
6843400	6848480	But you don't, this should be, I sent you like a shitload of stuff last night, last night.
6848480	6849480	Oh, last night?
6849480	6850480	Yeah.
6850480	6851480	Okay.
6851480	6852480	I haven't checked it.
6852480	6853480	Oh, okay.
6853480	6854480	Because I haven't been flying in a year.
6854480	6855480	It's okay.
6855480	6856480	I sent you the text saying, I'm sorry, I just saw this now.
6856480	6857480	Yeah.
6857480	6858480	That's what I'm saying.
6858480	6859480	Yeah.
6859480	6860480	I haven't checked whatever it is you sent.
6860480	6861480	Okay, good.
6861480	6862480	Okay.
6862480	6863480	You've got a lot, there's a lot of reading in there.
6863480	6864480	You'll see.
6864480	6865480	But you've read the report, though.
6865480	6870480	I don't have, if you sent the report in that group, I haven't read it yet.
6870480	6871480	The good report?
6871480	6872480	No.
6872480	6873480	So, yeah, I just have a good report.
6873480	6874480	Oh, good.
6874480	6875480	Okay.
6875480	6876480	So, you sort of, oh, good.
6876480	6877480	I got to you first.
6877480	6878480	That's good.
6878480	6879480	So, you get your first impression from me first.
6879480	6880480	Not that report.
6880480	6881480	That's a good sign for me.
6881480	6882480	Very happy to hear that.
6882480	6883480	That's good.
6883480	6888480	So, we can do some more research on our insights, see what thing you have.
6888480	6889480	Good.
6889480	6891480	I can't promise anything else, but I cannot promise my own right.
6891480	6894480	Like, I can't promise that I mean you don't need all of that help at all.
6894480	6895480	That's good to me.
6895480	6896480	But I can't tell you I'll be honest, right?
6896480	6898480	I'll be honest with you about what we can do and what we can't do.
6898480	6902480	And, I'll give you some options sometimes and say, well, we can try this and try that.
6902480	6905480	It may include to different ways.
6905480	6909480	But I can't promise what I promise what we can do.
6909480	6910480	I got that.
6910480	6912480	Um, Look, what do you want if you want it?
6912480	6919960	What did you have on there that you wanted to show up?
6919960	6922080	Seriously, it will be here all week.
6922080	6924000	OK, can you even find it in summary,
6924000	6927520	like the overview of what you see?
6927520	6929000	Do you like political shit?
6929000	6932280	Or do you like give me a genre?
6932280	6934200	I work in cyber crime.
6934200	6935040	Oh, you do?
6935040	6937840	OK, that's what I thought.
6937840	6939600	You read it on that article, I know.
6939600	6942080	So you're going to do that part, right?
6942080	6943520	So I work in cyber crime.
6943520	6944800	So we look for hackers.
6944800	6948360	We do ransomware, or BTC, and jacking.
6948360	6949360	Oh, you do?
6949360	6950360	Really?
6950360	6954160	Yeah, we do much other stuff, like computer issues in general.
6954160	6955640	I do some stalking pieces.
6955640	6958120	Do you have all the toys in tact shit, too?
6958120	6959440	I've got a lot of toys.
6959440	6960200	Oh, really?
6960200	6961000	OK.
6961000	6961520	But yeah.
6961520	6962800	Dude, OK.
6962800	6964720	Do you need like an apprentice?
6964720	6966720	All right.
6966720	6969320	Do you want to come out to QC and see all the toys we have?
6969960	6973640	In our hand presses, and then you ask the whole band to give them out.
6973640	6975040	Well, yeah, OK.
6975040	6976600	OK, yeah, well, I can help you.
6976600	6978880	I'm a self-taught hacker.
6978880	6979840	I'm not very good.
6979840	6982480	I did not hack Sony, OK?
6982480	6983640	I did not do that.
6983640	6986240	They was accused of that, but I did not do that.
6986240	6990080	The stuff on DDoS Secrets, I was stupid enough to say,
6990080	6993280	I'm like, can you actually give me credit for my stuff?
6993280	6994400	Can you put my name?
6994400	6997880	I'm the only idiot that said, here, put my name on it.
6997880	7002800	But MPS, Monty Duposky, that was not a hack of the documents
7002800	7007000	were given to me by the Anatella Rossi.
7007000	7008320	So it was not a hack.
7008320	7010840	And she said, I want you to make this public as possible,
7010840	7013320	because we dated Rossi's story out there.
7013320	7014480	So I said, of course.
7014480	7016960	And she knew I had connections with New York Times,
7016960	7019760	and most returnals, and that's what she wanted.
7019760	7023680	So I helped her, and Luca was her lawyer.
7023680	7027560	It seems like a very, like you walk in one light bulb
7027560	7030600	on this old ancient desk, smoking a cigarette,
7030600	7035720	speaking Italian, perfectly safe of a lawyer.
7035720	7037760	He also wanted all this everywhere.
7037760	7041280	He wanted me to disseminate as much as I could.
7041280	7042600	We had a deal.
7042600	7044960	I said, if you can give me anything in McKaylee Faisola,
7044960	7047560	anything in my father, anything you got,
7047560	7049120	I'll give you whatever I have.
7049120	7052200	And I don't really, let's look for David Rossi.
7052200	7053200	I don't have much in here.
7053240	7055320	If you want to do it, you can do it right now.
7055320	7056520	So that was our trade.
7056520	7059400	And man, I told you in town, but he told me
7059400	7062040	the craziest fucking story.
7062040	7064680	It'll take a long time to tell you the story.
7064680	7070040	The short version is that Monty Duposky, the Calabria mafia,
7070040	7074560	is using MPS to launder their money.
7074560	7079120	And they're using it in very interesting and creative ways,
7079120	7081520	like putting cash in basketballs for the Italian basketball
7081520	7083080	team.
7083080	7086400	Literally, they'll have basketballs filled with cash.
7086400	7089600	And then they give the basketballs to some other team.
7089600	7091520	They trade them with other basketballs.
7091520	7093280	And that's how they do the cash exchange.
7093280	7094440	Fucking weird.
7094440	7095920	I swear to God.
7095920	7097440	And we've got David Rossi.
7097440	7099800	And Anatella says this happened.
7099800	7102120	And Luca says this is what happened.
7102120	7105760	David Rossi would pick up just a briefcase full of cash.
7105760	7106440	He'd rent a car.
7106440	7109640	He would drive from Siena to Lugano.
7109680	7113600	And he would just start dumping cash into different accounts.
7113600	7117640	And then one guy that picked up the cash count
7117640	7122840	is Cardinal Scorano from the Vatican, caught on CCTV.
7122840	7123800	And he's laundering money.
7123800	7126960	He's got a history of being a dirty banker as well.
7126960	7128040	So this is very interesting.
7128040	7130480	But no one's gone after him the second time.
7130480	7131920	He's got to go.
7131920	7133960	Or has to mention that he doesn't go.
7133960	7136240	Both of them.
7136240	7138600	And how do you know what to tell him?
7138640	7140640	I went over and then visited her.
7140640	7144320	When I was a, it's a really, it's another story
7144320	7146040	if you want to have a story time.
7146040	7149680	But I was trapped in Amsterdam.
7149680	7152760	Like literally trapped in a fucking campsite.
7152760	7155240	Someone broke into my rental car and stole,
7155240	7159120	like I had this computer in black case, Macbook,
7159120	7161840	and it was underneath the passenger seat.
7161840	7163600	And it's the dead of night in Amsterdam.
7163600	7167000	Like 3 AM, I'm going into town and I buy some cigarettes.
7167000	7170080	So I leave the car for a little, maybe 10 minutes.
7170080	7173240	And I walk back and cobblestone streets and I see glass.
7173240	7175840	I say, oh, poor fucker, guys, car broke in.
7175840	7176880	It's mine.
7176880	7179800	No, they did not take my passport.
7179800	7182560	They did not take my 30 or 40 euros.
7182560	7185040	You know, sitting in that little tray between the passenger
7185040	7186120	and the driver's mind.
7186120	7189200	They didn't take my fender strad in the back seat
7189200	7190400	or anything else.
7190400	7192480	They only took that computer, which I have a dutch bank
7192480	7195840	stuff that I had just bought in New York City
7195880	7197400	a month and a half prior.
7197400	7200680	And I just organized all my dutch bank shit,
7200680	7202240	all the files on that computer.
7202240	7203080	It was encrypted.
7203080	7204720	There's no way anyone can get to it.
7204720	7206520	And anyone that would pull off something like that,
7206520	7209360	it's got to be a shitty private investigator.
7209360	7210760	There's no, anyone that's sophisticated
7210760	7212800	would have just fucking hacked it, you know,
7212800	7214600	or given up on anyone saying it was encrypted.
7214600	7215440	There's no way in.
7215440	7216640	It was air gap, I forgot to say.
7216640	7217480	There's no way.
7218760	7220080	But that's the only thing that was taken.
7220080	7223240	And I suspect dutch bank hired a private investigator.
7223240	7224640	That's where I think.
7224640	7229000	In Prague, I thought I was gonna die
7229000	7233560	when this guy, Italian thug, pulls me out of the car
7233560	7235000	and starts beating on me.
7236480	7238040	And he doesn't speak a word of English.
7238040	7241440	I just came to buy some car to the mall in Czechoslovakia.
7241440	7243920	Have you ever been to a mall in Prague?
7243920	7245400	It's fucking weird.
7245400	7246480	It's a weird place.
7246480	7247720	I once died on a train.
7247720	7248880	Oh, in Prague?
7248880	7250200	What happened?
7250200	7251040	I got to get off.
7251040	7251880	No, no.
7251880	7253440	I ended up in a train.
7253440	7254280	That's not good.
7254280	7255600	It was not good.
7255600	7257880	No, it was like, it was bad.
7257880	7261120	Yeah, I hit the SOS button in the car, like,
7261120	7262520	help, I'm being murdered.
7262520	7263800	This guy's gonna murder me.
7263800	7265320	And I forgot, I had bought a fake gun,
7265320	7266880	like a BB gun in Germany.
7266880	7268840	And I never, I don't know anything about guns,
7268840	7270560	but I should have used it.
7270560	7271800	Maybe he would have run away,
7271800	7274080	but I forgot it was in the fucking apartment.
7274080	7276320	So instead I'm just like, I use my phone.
7276320	7277320	Look, you're on camera.
7277320	7278600	Stop kicking me, stop this.
7278600	7280160	You're being on camera.
7280160	7282720	And the SOS, here's it all.
7282720	7285040	And next thing I know, the fucking SWAT teams.
7285040	7287120	They got machine guns, there's six of them.
7287120	7289160	And they surround us, and they tell the guy,
7289160	7291800	he has fucking hands up, and I'm like,
7291800	7294400	that's the guy, we know that's the guy.
7294400	7295520	They're speaking English.
7295520	7299160	And then the dude does the strangest thing.
7299160	7302720	He's surrounded by the SWAT team, with M16s,
7302720	7304400	wherever those big guns are.
7304400	7308680	He takes off his shirt, so you can see he's topless, right?
7308680	7309920	Why does he take off his shirt?
7309920	7312160	Cause he's got military tattoos.
7312200	7314240	This is how he's going to communicate to the Czech police
7314240	7315640	that I'm one of you.
7315640	7317920	That's what he did in 20 of the time he looked
7317920	7320680	at the EU military, some sort of service.
7320680	7322240	And they put down the gun, it works.
7322240	7324320	They're like, what is going on here?
7324320	7327120	Turns out, we take over the police station,
7327120	7331800	and like a fucking lady from a central casting,
7331800	7333680	Interpol, shows up, you know?
7333680	7336640	He's like, I don't want to be here in a sunday or anything.
7336640	7339920	Get me, who's this stupid American, you know, sorry.
7339920	7341440	Turns out he's from Avis rental car,
7341440	7343720	and he just came to repo the car.
7343720	7345960	That's the fucking crazy shit that it was, man.
7345960	7347840	It was a weird time, you know?
7347840	7349960	I don't know why I told you that story, but it's fine.
7351320	7352480	What was the question?
7352480	7353320	Sorry.
7353320	7354160	Let's go back to your hacking system.
7354160	7355000	Oh, hacking?
7355000	7355840	Yes.
7355840	7357720	What kind of skills do you know,
7357720	7358920	what kind of techniques do you know?
7358920	7362160	Well, I guess my, the only one I pulled off,
7362160	7364960	like really successfully was my mother.
7365960	7368160	But we had a lot of time in planning, though.
7368160	7370320	It was just a man in the middle of watching my hack.
7370360	7371200	It was really easy.
7371200	7372480	Was it a Wi-Fi fan app or something?
7372480	7374920	I have a pineapple, but I did not use a pineapple.
7374920	7377800	I could not, I was like, I had no money, I had nothing.
7377800	7381760	I had to learn how to increase the output of my battery
7381760	7385920	power on the MacBook to handle all the fucking thoroughfare
7385920	7387720	that was coming in through the,
7387720	7389640	well, I had practiced at this hotel down there.
7389640	7392720	They called the, in Venice Beach,
7394040	7396960	but it was a, I spoofed their,
7397960	7402560	it's in Manhattan Beach,
7402560	7405240	and it was where I learned everything for two weeks.
7405240	7407720	Anyway, I spoofed the router,
7407720	7409800	and I learned Wireshark at that time,
7409800	7411400	which was like driving me crazy
7411400	7412920	because all I got were the packets,
7412920	7415280	but I could not figure out how to put the packets together
7415280	7418360	and took me, like, maybe I'm slow, I don't know,
7418360	7419560	but it took me a while to figure out
7419560	7421040	how to put the fucking packets together.
7421040	7423440	And once I did, I was like, shit, I have passwords now.
7423440	7427160	I have some, well, not full passwords,
7427160	7428440	they're still broken up,
7428440	7431920	but you can just put them into a algorithm that will,
7433360	7436240	yeah, John the Ripper or something,
7436240	7439600	anything that's, actually, John the Ripper won't work,
7439600	7443200	it's more like a, I don't know, it's,
7443200	7444640	Sorry?
7444640	7445800	Rainbow table?
7445800	7448520	No, the table one, that's not very easy one,
7448520	7451440	the table hack, that's the injection one,
7451520	7454080	were you in CaliLinux, you're talking about?
7455120	7457320	Yeah, it's been a long time since I took that class,
7457320	7459520	but I thought you're just running it
7459520	7461040	against a dictionary or something?
7461040	7463600	Yeah, well, you are, but you also had an algorithm
7463600	7465200	that's specific to what you're looking for.
7465200	7466360	Like, I knew my mom's,
7466360	7469120	my mom would have a very specific list
7469120	7470400	of names she would use, right?
7470400	7472440	So I had to plug in just those,
7472440	7474400	and I had to have the, you know,
7474400	7476320	anything over eight fucking,
7477520	7479360	it's good we can talk a little bit, this is fun,
7479360	7481000	anything over eight letters is gonna take over
7481000	7485760	a day and a half, unless you have a 20 gig GEX,
7485760	7487680	whatever, NVIDIA card, you know,
7487680	7490240	that's with Elkumsoft, which is the fastest
7490240	7492160	password cracker I've seen so far right now,
7492160	7494320	on the market, I'm sure you guys
7494320	7495960	probably have access to something cooler than that,
7495960	7498400	but it takes a long time.
7498400	7500400	But it's a lot of it, you just have to use your intuition
7500400	7503480	or make a phone call, you know, I didn't say you,
7503480	7506800	you know, that's the best way to do it is this,
7506800	7509960	they call it social engineering,
7511040	7513360	so that's the most fun way to do it.
7513360	7515680	How do you learn, like, do you take classes?
7515680	7517880	You too, we don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
7517880	7522120	I was, you don't understand, my dad just killed himself,
7522120	7525200	my mom cut me out of the family,
7525200	7528920	I was sequestered to rehab, it was a very nice rehab,
7528920	7532040	but I was not free, I was like, for four months,
7532040	7533520	I'd say that.
7533520	7534640	You're a whole lot more than me,
7534960	7536920	I've taken the classes that you and I,
7536920	7538680	I don't understand everything.
7538680	7542280	But I had to, it was like, if you have no money
7542280	7543480	and you have to feed yourself
7543480	7544960	and someone throws you in a foreign country,
7544960	7547360	you're gonna learn, you know, that's what it was for me,
7547360	7549240	it was like, I had to know why my dad killed himself,
7549240	7551760	I had to figure it out, I had to get into his email,
7551760	7553720	so I just sat down and fucking focused.
7554680	7556600	I was impressed, I was like,
7556600	7557760	I was planning on killing myself,
7557760	7560120	you know what, maybe my mom will learn something
7560120	7561600	if I die the same year, you know,
7561600	7563160	maybe my sister will never have the stuff,
7563160	7564800	I was being a martyr, you know,
7564800	7567440	I was being a little shit too, being an asshole.
7567440	7570480	And the doctor said, you know what Val,
7570480	7571920	we're gonna try and give you out or all,
7571920	7575080	let's see what this does, what the fuck that was like.
7575080	7577440	You know, and then I take it, I'm playing,
7577440	7579000	three hours like that.
7579000	7581200	All right, let's learn cocking, you know,
7581200	7582320	finance is next.
7582320	7584880	And you know what, it fucking saved my life that thing,
7584880	7586400	it really did, I drugged,
7586400	7587560	and people say don't be drugs,
7587560	7590960	but sometimes drugs really work, it shows you.
7590960	7594840	Yeah, if you're depressed, you don't see any hope,
7594840	7596720	sometimes the drug will just give you a glimpse
7596720	7598800	and remind you that there is another way
7598800	7602240	of viewing the world, you know, that's it.
7602240	7604280	But anyway, yeah, I was fueled with out or all,
7604280	7605320	it was very helpful.
7606920	7610040	Yeah, I found focus, I never, like I was a dumb musician,
7610040	7612400	I thought I had, there's no way I was gonna learn
7612400	7614440	how a derivative work, right?
7614440	7617040	I had no fucking, I was very proud of myself,
7617040	7618600	and I thought my father was very proud too,
7618600	7621320	and that's kind of another thing, kind of,
7621320	7623960	you know, a little fuel, a fuel to the fire.
7625560	7628000	So what other things really need to happen?
7628000	7629960	Like, do you know anything about ransomware?
7629960	7634480	I do, yeah, I stay away from it, it sounds,
7634480	7636160	I mean, it sounds like it's really,
7636160	7638960	it's not, I mean, I've never had anything around somewhere,
7638960	7642160	but it doesn't seem like a difficult thing to break,
7642160	7644200	I mean, it's gotta be localized on the computer
7644200	7646480	and you can isolate it, it's not,
7646480	7649080	if you take the computer offline,
7649080	7650720	it's not like a self-destruct button
7650720	7654800	that where all of a sudden your computer's gone dead,
7654800	7657120	you can isolate the fucking hack.
7657120	7659360	It's just like anything, you know, any virus.
7659360	7661640	Well, not like any virus, I don't know much about it,
7661640	7664560	but if someone's putting a foreign code
7664560	7666440	onto your computer, it's depending where it is,
7666440	7668200	and again, remember, there's different types,
7668200	7670640	and with Intel, the new shit we learned about Intel,
7670640	7673880	with the hack on the chips, there's a whole new,
7674880	7677720	it's like a whole new industry, but there's a whole new,
7678880	7682440	what's the word, like a way to get at data,
7684440	7685560	I can't remember the names of them
7685560	7687920	because it's, my brain's on 100% today,
7687920	7689720	but the ones, the Intel chips, the flaws
7689720	7692000	that were found about a year and a half ago,
7692000	7693120	do you remember what you know what I'm talking about?
7693120	7693960	The vulnerability, thank you.
7693960	7694800	What's it called?
7694800	7695640	Vulnerability?
7695640	7697480	Yeah, but what were the names of the ghost one?
7697480	7698600	Well, no, no, no, I don't,
7698600	7701240	I think the noise might be one of these problems.
7701240	7702960	So the things Intel fucked up,
7702960	7705120	and from the very beginning when we started making chips,
7705120	7710120	there was a cache, or a cache, or whether you can,
7710320	7712800	yes, we could get all the credentials back
7712800	7716120	from the actual chip, and every single computer
7716120	7719240	in the world is vulnerable to this, every single computer,
7719240	7721000	and that's fucking amazing, right?
7721000	7723080	So that gives you completely new access,
7723080	7725840	and three different companies found this out at the same time.
7725840	7727640	It's like the 100th monkey hearing.
7728600	7729440	Do you know the thing?
7729440	7730280	The 100th monkey?
7730280	7731120	Yeah, the 100th monkey.
7731120	7734520	Great, yeah, it's just, the idea has sort of happened.
7734520	7736760	But anyway, yeah, that's a whole new way of doing it.
7736760	7737760	I know how to do,
7740080	7742160	my best thing is social engineering,
7742160	7745560	and then, you know, I'm not really a coder.
7745560	7746400	I don't know how to do it,
7746400	7749160	but I can take other people's programs
7749160	7751680	and use them very well, you know?
7751680	7754200	Elk and Soft kind of pisses me off a little bit.
7754200	7756520	These guys, they overdo it, but,
7756520	7759440	I mean, I have magnet, I have Elk and Soft,
7759440	7763000	I have the orange one.
7764160	7766520	I can't remember, I can't remember what it's called.
7766520	7769440	Belk is off, there's no issue, you know what?
7769440	7770280	Oh, you know what?
7770280	7773160	I'll show you, I'll show you what I got.
7773160	7775120	You know, magnet is the best right now.
7775120	7777440	See, and I'm thinking, like, why go through,
7777440	7780800	why do all this extra work you don't need to do
7780800	7782040	if you can just get the fucking,
7782040	7783240	someone's already built the program,
7783240	7786200	we'll go out there and invent the wheel, right?
7786200	7791200	So if, for example, if Elk and Soft, oh shit,
7792360	7793360	let me see the options,
7795400	7798600	if Elk and Soft is already created a way
7798600	7802040	to get the tar ball off your iPhone 11,
7802040	7804120	why do I have to create a program
7804120	7804960	that do the same thing,
7804960	7806920	that you've got people that spend a lot of time
7806920	7808080	and money doing it?
7808080	7809280	So I'll just use their shit
7809280	7811240	and improvise with other people's shit.
7811240	7814640	Like, the pineapple is not that great, you know?
7814640	7815640	It's not that interesting.
7816640	7820520	And also it's a little, it's not user-friendly, you know?
7820520	7822520	It's like you have to really sit down and study
7822520	7825120	the fucking stick of pineapple and what not to do it.
7825120	7828160	So I build a, like a fast way to do it for my girlfriend
7828160	7829120	because she wanted to know how to do it,
7829120	7830520	but she had no patience to sit down
7830520	7835520	and learn how to keep the AP or the evil twin thing.
7835680	7838520	You know, so I just showed her like a,
7838520	7842600	I created like a shortcut for her, which is sort of-
7842600	7847840	How did you make it easier for her from Bernie?
7847840	7850000	I automated it, yeah.
7850000	7851400	It's easier if you do that,
7851400	7852720	because she just does one thing,
7852720	7855120	everything falls into place instead of making her,
7855120	7858240	it makes her think like she's accomplished something, you know?
7858240	7862120	It's not that hard to just automate, let me see, you know.
7862120	7865560	Sorry, so let me show you, for example.
7867000	7868360	Oh, Evan Tree was the other one.
7868360	7870920	The other one is her Wi-Fi off, it's Bluetooth off.
7870920	7871760	Oh, yeah.
7872720	7873560	Of course, of course.
7873560	7875600	Your security and ours, but-
7875600	7877240	Oh, really?
7877240	7879280	You guys got people, interesting.
7880360	7882600	Yeah, I mean, I think, sorry, I got all excited,
7882600	7885000	but I forgot that you guys were with the FBI.
7885000	7890000	Shit, okay, yeah, Wi-Fi's off, Bluetooth is off.
7892360	7897120	So let's pull up, like phone breaker,
7898120	7901720	Xcode, I can do, I don't know,
7901720	7903840	can you be more specific, is there something you're looking for?
7903840	7905360	It's not 10, it says your level of skill
7905360	7907080	would like need your help to do something.
7907080	7907920	Okay.
7908760	7911080	You know, we needed you to look at, you know,
7911080	7912520	vulnerable website or something like that,
7912520	7914040	is that something you could do?
7914040	7914880	Oh.
7914880	7917080	You know, if we had a phone, we'd be pretty good.
7917080	7918640	The phone I could do a lot better
7918640	7920960	than I could with the vulnerable website.
7920960	7923320	I could do the website, but it would take me a little extra time,
7923320	7925680	because I have not studied that one as much.
7925680	7927840	I mean, I used to do it before,
7928800	7930720	maybe when it was easy, when everything was on the server,
7930720	7933800	and you could just do it for the back space.
7933800	7935400	Remember, you could just do that stupid thing,
7935400	7937440	you know, maybe I could do that.
7937440	7939240	But the phone is more fun for me, that's easy,
7939240	7942040	that's not easy, but it's more of a challenge.
7942040	7944840	Because I did my dad's phone, I did my girlfriend's phone,
7944840	7946920	and then people would find phones on the street for me
7946920	7949400	and just sell it to me, it's just like a friend practice.
7949400	7951720	It is fun, that's what I like.
7952560	7954360	And the remote stuff is,
7956640	7958160	well, am I gonna get in trouble
7958160	7960240	for telling you guys something this short?
7960240	7961920	He told me like you murdered someone,
7961920	7962960	they probably didn't believe you.
7962960	7964800	I never murdered anybody, okay?
7964800	7966520	No murder, okay?
7970200	7973120	The New York Times asked me to hack Epstein.
7973120	7975160	Okay, so they didn't want me to hack Epstein.
7975160	7979200	So I did it, and everyone's very,
7979200	7981120	I didn't, oh sorry, I didn't do it.
7981120	7984280	I started the process of doing it,
7984280	7986400	and I gave him the list of passwords,
7986400	7987440	and I gave him the list,
7987440	7989200	and I have this on email to prove to you,
7989200	7991680	okay, the passwords, and I gave him the list of logins,
7991680	7993440	that's it, all the credentials.
7993440	7996360	And I gave him the Gislane's credentials as well.
7996360	7999840	I did not break in, I did try, okay, made an attempt,
7999840	8003320	but it was a double authentication,
8003320	8005440	someone already got to it.
8005440	8006660	I don't know whose number it is,
8006660	8008920	but I have a phone number if you wanna trace it,
8008920	8010480	it would be helpful for you guys.
8011640	8016640	And I found out a lot, for Kevin Hall,
8016720	8018720	actually, I did this one in the morning.
8018720	8020800	I know someone who's running around, so.
8020800	8024640	Oh, Kevin Hall is doing this one in the morning,
8024640	8028600	and he's a partner with me,
8028600	8030360	she wrote the Epstein story.
8032640	8037640	Yeah, she's really good, really good, yeah.
8037880	8039880	I didn't wanna know if someone was running around,
8040000	8044520	but I helped him by just looking at his old email addresses
8044520	8048440	from like 1999, old banks that he used in old,
8050320	8053520	just old accounts, and lawyers that he used as well,
8053520	8056120	because a lot of the lawyers are hiding some money too.
8057440	8058760	Stuff like that, yeah.
8060760	8064000	Just, you know, I usually don't give away a secret,
8064000	8065240	but I'll give you a secret,
8065240	8067360	and it'll make it seem so mundane and obvious to you,
8067360	8069320	you'll think like, why didn't I think of that?
8069320	8071280	It's the easiest possible way to start,
8071280	8073960	and mostly, people ask you to find a password,
8073960	8075240	this is the easiest thing to do.
8075240	8078960	You just get a database of the billion or so
8078960	8080600	already hacked files,
8080600	8083480	you find the old password that somebody used,
8083480	8085600	and you just sort of engineer from there,
8085600	8087760	it's not that hard, yeah.
8087760	8089280	A lot of people don't change their passwords,
8089280	8092160	and when they do, they make a variation.
8092160	8093000	That's all you have.
8093000	8093840	Right.
8094960	8097720	I used to usually work alone, you work with other people?
8097720	8102720	No, no, I don't understand how you work with,
8104640	8107200	I mean, teach me, there's a way to work with other people,
8107200	8109280	yeah, teach me, because usually, I don't know,
8109280	8112080	like usually it's one person doing all the work,
8112080	8114960	and the other person is watching, so, I don't know.
8119240	8122440	But yeah, I'd like to, I would love to try, I mean.
8122440	8125080	Yeah, like I said, right now I'm completely list of stuff
8125160	8127680	that like, okay, we could use help on this,
8127680	8129320	so it's maybe something that we could do.
8129320	8131360	We could try to find a spot for you, still.
8131360	8133160	I feel like it's that, I guess, on my head.
8133160	8136200	What I'm really good at doing is I could find
8136200	8137920	stolen money and money laundering.
8137920	8139280	If someone needs to move money,
8139280	8140680	I can show you how to do that.
8140680	8144080	I know how to, I know people that can reverse engineer,
8144080	8148160	there's a word for it, Bitcoin wallets?
8148160	8149920	Reverse growth, what do you call it?
8149920	8151840	Well, how do they, how do they,
8151840	8154320	I mean, if they're gonna track where the Bitcoin goes,
8155080	8158200	no, they can find, no, how, where it came from.
8158200	8160840	They can do the whole scrub, they call it,
8160840	8163000	it's not scrub, it's called the,
8163000	8167240	they're watching it now, like you're telling,
8167240	8168840	because it's all public, so that you can see
8168840	8169720	where it goes to and from,
8169720	8171400	you mean after it's been tumbled or something?
8171400	8172720	After it's been, yes.
8172720	8175240	Not tumbled, after it's been put into any wallet.
8175240	8178640	They can trace it, like a reverse trace.
8178640	8180600	There's two people I know that can do it.
8180600	8182600	That part's not too difficult, I'll tell you.
8182600	8183440	It's not, okay.
8184080	8184920	Oh, you can?
8184920	8186400	Okay, I don't know anything about it.
8186400	8187880	And it's just like the ledger is public,
8187880	8190040	so you can see where the money comes and goes to.
8190040	8192160	It's just that this number means nothing.
8192160	8196320	Oh, no, but it's not that simple.
8196320	8198160	I mean, yeah, I know there's an open ledger,
8198160	8202600	but it's also, there's like a wallet
8202600	8204400	that has self-account as well,
8204400	8206480	so you have to find out where it, yeah.
8206480	8207800	It's like, they know how to do that.
8207800	8209080	They can, they can,
8211800	8213160	I'm not sure what the wording is.
8213200	8214040	You see, that would be nice.
8214040	8217280	I would like to know what the terms are for these things.
8217280	8219360	I know how to do it, I know what the action is,
8219360	8222320	but I don't know the term, the term, the terminology.
8222320	8226960	Okay, so what other stuff do you have access to?
8226960	8229240	I mean, because you have access to a lot of journalists, right?
8229240	8230600	And here's the thing.
8230600	8232720	I don't really want to deal with journalists
8232720	8235200	because it's the first-minute stuff that's there.
8235200	8237360	Journalists have a lot of data.
8237360	8240560	They're a very untapped source of data.
8240560	8242560	You know, if you know how to say the right thing,
8242560	8245080	you can get all, I got the guys in Russia,
8245080	8247520	there was a spy on trial,
8247520	8249800	he's a banker spy, and I got the guy
8249800	8252040	to send me the whole fucking transcripts,
8252040	8253040	court records, everything.
8253040	8254360	You mean the journalist was able
8254360	8256280	to get the court records in 2017?
8256280	8258960	Yes, okay, yes, interesting.
8258960	8260760	Journalists have a lot of shit,
8260760	8262560	and they just sit on it and just goes,
8262560	8265000	once the story's done, they forget about it.
8265000	8265920	They don't need it anymore.
8265920	8270080	So there's a huge fucking great source of information.
8270080	8272840	Nobody even bothers to get it.
8272840	8274760	But I know so many journalists now,
8274760	8276400	and they're sending me shit all the time.
8276400	8278800	People, I just have this guy named,
8278800	8279720	well, I'm not gonna tell you his name,
8279720	8280920	because that would be kind of weird.
8280920	8283160	It would be weird to do that, too.
8283160	8285880	But he just found me on Twitter and said,
8285880	8288880	Val, I think that there's some shady shit
8288880	8290000	going on in the Bank of Ireland.
8290000	8291360	Can you take a look at this one?
8291360	8292920	And I guess, I take a look at it,
8292920	8297920	and lo and behold, Wilbur Ross stole $35 billion
8298520	8300280	from Bank of Ireland.
8300280	8302960	Well, Wilbur Ross and his compatriots,
8302960	8307960	but 23, he calls them hedge funds because they're not hedge
8309280	8311160	funds, they're more like LSEs.
8311160	8314560	But 23 of them that he owns, Wilbur Ross owns, okay?
8316520	8321520	Bank of Ireland hid $35 billion in promissory bonds, sorry.
8321920	8326920	He bought a portion of that bank for 1% for like,
8327960	8331000	like something so touchy, like a couple billion dollars.
8331000	8334840	And his, that share gave him access to $35 billion,
8334840	8337720	which he pulled out, and it's fucking amazing.
8337720	8338680	It's amazing.
8338680	8340000	So look, I get shit like that,
8340000	8342440	but then I get the weird spy people, you know?
8342440	8345400	Like the crazy people, they're not crazy.
8345400	8347640	They're, sometimes they're reading a script.
8347640	8349440	Like, I don't know if they're intelligence
8349440	8351000	from corporate intelligence,
8351000	8352680	or if they're actual state-run intelligence.
8352680	8354040	I can't tell.
8354040	8356000	Like this guy, Kaiser Soze, right?
8357000	8362000	So he's, he did a very classic move where you,
8362520	8365680	instead of going right for me, he goes to people around me,
8365680	8367160	and then they start talking about,
8367160	8368960	and I'm like, oh, who's this guy you're talking about?
8368960	8369800	Right?
8369800	8370640	And that's how I get hooked.
8370640	8372840	And I saw that coming a mile away, right?
8372840	8374600	So I was like, okay, I'm here.
8374600	8375800	What do you want to say?
8375800	8377520	And he won't tell me who's really moving.
8377520	8380920	And he goes into this story, it's very specific,
8380920	8383600	and it's very good, and I really wish it was true,
8383600	8384960	but I don't believe it is.
8385000	8389480	But I do believe that 60, the 40% of it,
8389480	8394160	somewhere over this bridge of the 50% market, is true.
8394160	8395360	It makes sense.
8395360	8397720	Trump, there was a meeting in Deutsche Bank,
8397720	8399400	he says, when my father was there,
8399400	8401000	and he, it's a lie, my father was never there.
8401000	8403600	I checked his schedule, he did not go to this meeting.
8403600	8405800	And Jurgen Fitchison was not there either.
8405800	8406960	He claims he was there.
8406960	8410160	And two people from Natsutzky were there,
8410160	8412040	and he was one of them, right?
8412040	8414520	He says that they came in to buy a silo,
8414520	8418600	which is a collateralized loan obligation.
8418600	8420920	It's basically a structured product.
8420920	8425920	It's a, it's a whole shitload of mortgages
8427000	8430360	put together into one bundle that you can buy.
8430360	8431680	And it's like a bank-to-bank thing.
8431680	8433560	You can't, it probably gives no access to it.
8433560	8435520	So they thought they were gonna get rid of this,
8435520	8438800	this charge, and sell it to Natsutzky.
8438800	8440720	And the guy said, well, the problem is,
8440720	8443360	we don't want you to buy it, we just want you to look at it
8443480	8445040	and tell us what you think.
8445040	8447000	And tell us before you see the problem.
8447000	8449560	So they looked at it and they saw that,
8449560	8451560	to make this long story short,
8451560	8454160	Donald Trump did not sign a consenting agreement.
8455040	8456600	Okay, so if you have a,
8456600	8459800	if you guys are all in a trust, right,
8459800	8462040	that means that you're all shared,
8462040	8465440	it's sort of the money that's pooled together.
8465440	8468280	Let's say you wanted to borrow $5 million
8468280	8470280	to start a golf course, right?
8470280	8472040	But you don't tell these guys.
8472240	8473800	You take it, you take the $5 million,
8473800	8474640	you don't tell them,
8474640	8476640	and you don't sign a consenting agreement.
8476640	8480120	If you fail, they have to pay your debt, right?
8480120	8481880	If you sign a consenting agreement,
8481880	8484040	then they're free, right?
8484040	8486680	They're not liable for your debt if you fail.
8486680	8487520	But you made money,
8487520	8489120	you bring it back in and put it in the pool,
8489120	8492640	and everyone's very happy, except that you didn't,
8492640	8495120	they overlooked the fact that you didn't sign this agreement.
8495120	8497760	Now, Trump didn't sign three of them, right?
8497760	8499400	Which means the people at Deutsche Bank
8499440	8503440	and the high net worth individuals at DBTCA specifically
8503440	8506080	will be very upset to know that,
8506080	8509360	and it would cause them to run on DBTCA.
8509360	8512800	Now, and DBTCA has $23 billion going for it,
8513880	8516840	and they still don't have a fucking chief risk officer,
8516840	8518480	all right, $23 billion.
8518480	8523480	That is a 700 person entity, all right?
8523480	8526920	There's 25,000 Deutsche Bank America,
8526920	8528800	700 people in DBTCA.
8528800	8531520	It's very secretive, it's a weird place,
8531520	8533080	and that's where my dad,
8533080	8535120	that's where they put my father when he died,
8535120	8536320	when he killed himself.
8538280	8539480	There's a French guy that runs it,
8539480	8542040	and he was supposedly at this meeting as well.
8542040	8546360	Now, I'll just, fuck it, I'll just tell you.
8546360	8551360	The first guy is Rebolyev, signed off on the loan, okay?
8552080	8555280	The second one is, I don't believe him,
8555280	8557840	because I fed him the answer, and I fucked up.
8557840	8560280	You know when you say, oh, did you hear the word
8560280	8561760	Victor Bexelberg in the room?
8561760	8563520	He goes, oh yeah, that's it, right?
8563520	8565320	Fuck, I shouldn't have said that, yeah.
8565320	8568200	So he claims Victor Bexelberg was number two,
8568200	8570000	and number three is interesting,
8570000	8572040	I didn't believe him until yesterday,
8572040	8575280	because something interesting happened yesterday.
8575280	8579680	He said that Spare Bank signed on behalf,
8579680	8581440	a person signed on behalf of Spare Bank,
8581440	8583440	not anyone you've heard of, but as,
8583440	8586760	sorry, I'm sorry, not Spare Bank, Gazprom.
8586760	8589680	Gazprom is an entity signed off on a loan.
8589680	8591000	I'm like, what the fuck, how can an entity
8591000	8591840	sign off on a loan?
8591840	8593120	I've never heard of that.
8593120	8596680	Until yesterday, when this Irish guy I was telling about
8596680	8600800	sends me a, they call it charges,
8600800	8603720	they call it in Ireland, they call them charges mortgages,
8603720	8604560	right?
8604560	8608200	He sends me this, I have it right here if you wanna see it,
8609200	8614040	this charge of some land that was sold in Ireland
8614040	8615280	by Deutsche Bank.
8615320	8618680	So Deutsche Bank, as a bank, is an entity liable for it.
8618680	8620280	I was like, holy shit, it does,
8620280	8622600	and that's very, I've never seen that before.
8622600	8624640	And he asked me, I've never seen this before,
8624640	8626040	and I have not answered him yet,
8626040	8628120	I'm not gonna tell him yes, you know,
8628120	8630000	because I don't know who the fuck he's doing,
8630000	8631640	where his game is.
8631640	8634840	He's telling me that he wants to find a proper journalist,
8634840	8636640	he wants Roman Farrell, so I'm like, okay fine,
8636640	8638880	here's Roman Farrell, give him a Roman Farrell,
8638880	8641680	but he's still sending me documents, so I don't know.
8642680	8647840	And it's, things like that happen a lot, so, yeah.
8647840	8649000	So what do you wanna, like, you know,
8649000	8651760	economic fraud type stuff, it's good information.
8652920	8654880	If that's the case too, we'll probably pass it to
8654880	8657320	an economic fraud agent, if you can help out too.
8657320	8659080	That's right.
8659080	8661800	What other, like, are you involved in any hacking groups?
8661800	8665160	Do you know of any hacking groups that you can get into?
8665160	8666400	Like, yeah, a dark net type thing.
8666400	8671400	Well, I mean, is this like, what if I say yes, am I in trouble?
8672400	8674840	Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's one group.
8674840	8677440	Because obviously the FBI monitors a lot of these things,
8677440	8678840	and you like to see, you know, what's going on.
8678840	8680880	Yeah, you guys are in that signal group, aren't you?
8680880	8682120	What signal group?
8682120	8683760	Which one?
8683760	8685680	There's a bunch of signal groups.
8685680	8688640	There's one, I know there's some people that we checked,
8688640	8690320	and there's some like, brand new,
8690320	8693360	limited identities for some people,
8693360	8695040	we don't know where they came from, so.
8695040	8697280	I thought it was either FBI, or it was like,
8697280	8699480	some spies or something, so I don't know.
8699520	8702320	In the signal group, so the signal group,
8702320	8704520	there's the less than you would get?
8704520	8705920	Well, it's not, there's a couple of,
8705920	8708680	more than one signal group, so there's a group of people,
8708680	8710040	and they're not all hackers, it's like,
8710040	8713000	it's a mix of very interesting people.
8713000	8716600	Yeah, yeah, it's like, some of the greatest journalists,
8716600	8717720	and some of the greatest hackers,
8717720	8719280	and some of the greatest activists,
8719280	8721160	some of the greatest writers, you know,
8721160	8724360	and some just fucking fine, interesting people.
8724360	8725800	You know, everyone's having a conversation,
8725800	8728400	but specifically a hacking group, no.
8729360	8732160	But there's like, different variations of these signal groups,
8732160	8733800	and this one is Barrett, so.
8733800	8734920	When he said Houston, I was like,
8734920	8736800	oh fuck, he's after Barrett Brown.
8738520	8740040	Barrett's on the radar, I mean.
8740040	8740880	Yeah?
8740880	8742440	Like, but you know that, I mean,
8742440	8744440	he's been arrested already.
8744440	8748200	I know, he's in rehab right now, yeah, okay, good side, yeah.
8748200	8750080	Well, what's Barrett up to, do you talk to him?
8750080	8751320	Yeah, I talk to him all the time,
8751320	8753600	he pisses me off, he's a little fucking shit,
8753600	8755800	because he's supposed to write great,
8756360	8760800	huge, thunderous story against Val versus David Enridge,
8760800	8764240	but she got too high, and just fucking forgot about it.
8764240	8766680	Well, not forgot about it, just didn't do it.
8766680	8769000	So, and he hasn't even apologized yet,
8769000	8770400	so I'm very pissed off.
8771400	8776400	And I've got reams and reams of texts with him, so, yeah.
8777240	8779440	And he's a good guy, but he doesn't know shit about computers.
8779440	8780920	He's not an hacker.
8780920	8782800	He's a pharmacist for a good day.
8782800	8784840	Yeah, but he's a talker, he's not an hacker.
8784840	8787520	No, you barely know how to do that.
8787520	8790080	You couldn't find his key chain.
8790080	8791200	You couldn't do his key chain.
8791200	8793040	Seriously, he doesn't know shit.
8793040	8794360	That's the funny part about Barrett,
8794360	8796680	he doesn't know anything about computers.
8796680	8797520	Yeah.
8797520	8798520	So, just, like, sort of,
8798520	8800280	what part of you have Barrett about?
8800280	8802840	No, no, no, he's, you know, just,
8802840	8805160	he's kind of like, the reason I have some respect for him
8805160	8807800	is because he's sort of, like, on this vengeful path
8807800	8808960	that I understand now.
8808960	8811440	I've never been on a vengeful path before,
8811440	8814000	but now I understand it, I've started it,
8814000	8815400	and I know that's what he's doing too.
8815400	8818480	Like, whatever happened with the FBI and him.
8818480	8820520	But I don't know, I just think it's hilarious
8820520	8823360	when he got raided and he was live on the webcam.
8823360	8824840	I just thought that was funny, I don't know.
8824840	8826640	But then he fucking, I told him,
8827920	8830040	I actually recorded this conversation,
8830040	8832640	I told him, like, look, dude, where you fucked up
8832640	8835520	is where you went after the FBI agent's family.
8835520	8836760	That was stupid.
8836760	8838880	You must understand how dumb that was.
8838880	8840840	Yes, but, you know, I was already
8840840	8842080	gonna be put in jail anyway,
8842080	8845280	so, come on, bro, you could have avoided a lot of shit
8845280	8847400	if you just didn't do that stupid shit.
8847400	8850120	So he's an ego that won't,
8852000	8854240	that's his biggest issue, his ego.
8854240	8856240	He can't drop it for a second.
8856240	8861240	He doesn't have the humility or the ability to try.
8863360	8864320	That's the problem.
8864320	8866880	That's why you can't trust someone like that in here.
8866880	8869000	Do you guys part of the top over signal?
8869000	8870560	Yeah, yeah.
8870560	8872560	Well, again, I was trying to help him.
8872560	8874160	He had no, he's like homeless now,
8874160	8877160	with his weird girlfriend, so I was trying to help him.
8877160	8880280	You know, I got him a couple of hotel rooms,
8880280	8882120	I sent him some money, he was like, you know,
8882120	8885480	and then my girlfriend goes out of her way to,
8885480	8887760	sorry, now I'm just complaining, but she goes,
8887760	8889600	out of her way to get him a place to live
8889600	8891600	for like a month, so he's off the streets,
8891600	8893640	he doesn't have to worry about food and shit,
8893640	8895840	he can just work, because she's like,
8895840	8898280	do the thing where he fucking promised he promised us,
8898280	8899880	like, here's a place to live.
8899880	8902040	And instead of just going there and saying thank you
8902040	8904400	and doing it, he just like,
8904400	8906720	creates this whole chaotic thing of like,
8906720	8908360	well, you didn't tell me to call this day,
8908360	8911200	and you know, like this minutiae,
8911200	8912720	so he sabotages the whole thing,
8912720	8913640	and then at the end of the month,
8913640	8915560	you know what, very, go fuck yourself.
8915560	8917480	I don't, it's not opening anymore,
8917480	8920040	the windows closed, it's done.
8920040	8922400	And he's like, fuck you, I'm very, you know.
8922400	8924120	No, and I ignore him, the more I ignore him,
8924120	8926080	the more he wants your attention.
8926080	8927320	We're seeing it right now,
8927840	8930400	I mean, where in rehab, is it down or?
8933080	8934240	Do you really want to know?
8934240	8935760	I was just curious, I mean, like.
8935760	8937720	You're like, what?
8937720	8939000	No, maybe, you don't want to tell,
8939000	8939840	you don't have to tell.
8939840	8942560	No, I, I, I think it's important,
8942560	8945600	I think I want to know what and why.
8945600	8947400	Like, if I'm going to take the accountability
8947400	8948680	of doing something to somebody here,
8948680	8950560	I'm just going to get in trouble if we're in jail,
8950560	8951880	I would like to know who it is,
8951880	8953880	why I'm doing it and what for it.
8953880	8954720	You know what I mean?
8954720	8956440	I get it, I mean, I'll tell you this right now,
8956680	8959560	I can't tell you everything we do, right?
8959560	8960960	Like I said, I'll be honest with you
8960960	8962520	as much as you're going to be honest with me.
8962520	8964240	I can't tell you the motivation behind
8964240	8966120	every single question I ask,
8966120	8968160	because there's a lot of things that the FBI does,
8968160	8971400	like if we had an investigation into whatever,
8971400	8974480	I don't know, call it Barrett Brown, for example.
8974480	8976320	And you want to know why, and it's because,
8976320	8978440	oh, we're going to arrest him tomorrow, right?
8978440	8980720	And then you don't say, hey, Barrett, by the way,
8980720	8982280	meet you in the FBI, I'm going to fuck you tomorrow.
8982280	8983120	Yeah.
8983120	8984960	It probably wouldn't go well for us, right?
8984960	8987240	So that would have to be my choice, right?
8987240	8988080	Yeah.
8988080	8991280	So everything you could tell is totally up to you, right?
8991280	8993120	Like I'm not forcing you to give anything,
8993120	8993960	you're here on your own.
8993960	8996200	Well, I'm not going to give you a Barrett Brown right now.
8996200	8997920	If there's something that he's done
8997920	9000520	that you feel you want to know,
9000520	9002280	or if this is a Vendetta thing,
9002280	9004680	then I don't want to be part of the Vendetta.
9004680	9005520	Don't worry about that.
9005520	9007680	I mean, I'm trying to assess what information you have,
9007680	9010360	because whenever he's up there, I'm in Houston, so like.
9010360	9012400	Sure, you know, I've got a Jeremy Hammond,
9012520	9015480	Greg House, all the guys, all these people.
9015480	9017200	Because like that's the other thing we have to assess too,
9017200	9018520	is if you're not willing to help.
9018520	9021080	But Greg worked with you, Greg worked with you already.
9021080	9023200	Greg worked with you guys.
9023200	9025240	He's already been helpful, you know.
9025240	9026080	Yeah, yeah.
9026080	9027760	Like that's the thing is we're collecting
9027760	9029760	a lot of information on a lot of different things, right?
9029760	9030600	Right.
9030600	9033280	So part of it is, it's going to be a one-way street
9033280	9034280	of information this way.
9034280	9036400	I can't give you all the information that's,
9036400	9038840	so like if that's what you expect, then, you know,
9038840	9042000	it's no hard feelings, and we part ways, and it's just fun.
9042000	9044840	Because I can't tell you everything we do, because.
9044840	9045680	I know, I don't.
9045680	9047320	You don't know me, I don't know you either.
9047320	9049160	I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.
9049160	9050240	I don't.
9050240	9053480	No expectations, I just, if it's something that is,
9055680	9059800	if I mean, I'm going to be accountable for someone's life,
9059800	9062840	I'd really like to think it through, you know.
9062840	9063680	Yeah.
9063680	9066480	I mean, if you want me to blindly follow orders.
9067600	9068560	I mean, I will right now,
9068560	9071040	because Marla's life is in jeopardy, of course.
9071040	9073600	I'll do whatever the fuck you want to save Marla,
9073600	9076080	but at a certain, after that, you know,
9076080	9078240	I will have to draw a line or something.
9078240	9079440	And I, so here's the thing,
9079440	9081640	I want you to be as conscious of the decision.
9081640	9083200	Let's take Marla's whole way out of the situation.
9083200	9084040	Okay.
9084040	9086840	And you resolve Marla, everything's both static.
9086840	9088800	I want you to make the same decision as her then,
9088800	9089680	as you would before that.
9089680	9091400	Okay, well then, that depends on you.
9091400	9093880	If I like you guys, and I believe that this is,
9093880	9096840	you are like Tim and Jammy, and like you, again,
9096840	9100800	if they told, sent you to me, then I'm trusting them.
9100800	9102760	I believe you guys are the good people,
9102760	9105280	because there are some bad people in the FBI.
9105280	9107160	All right, there's some really fucking shits.
9107160	9109760	In every, not just the FBI, but everywhere.
9109760	9111680	And it's hard to find them and negotiate.
9111680	9113560	And you know, my read on you right now
9113560	9116240	is that you're a very highly intelligent guy.
9116240	9118680	You know, but you're hiding something from me right now,
9118680	9119520	and you haven't still,
9119520	9121560	you still haven't told me you're hiding something right now.
9121560	9122720	And you are here to suss me out
9122720	9124240	from a totally different point of view.
9124240	9126320	I'm not sure what point of view that is.
9126320	9128600	And you are here to completely give
9128600	9130240	the female point of view.
9130600	9131440	Oh, wow.
9133000	9133840	I'm joking.
9135160	9137760	You have a whole other case that you need help on,
9137760	9139320	which is not even related to this,
9139320	9141400	but I'm trying to figure out what that is for.
9141400	9143840	But you seem more like a New York-style person,
9143840	9145240	not an LA person.
9145240	9147120	So I'm thinking you've got to be,
9148040	9149480	you've got to be closer than Tim,
9149480	9152040	and you've got to be with Desky and Lyne.
9153480	9155480	No, not with Desky and Lyne.
9156480	9159920	Anyway, so, but your thing's unrelated to their thing,
9159920	9160760	right?
9161600	9162440	My clothes?
9163560	9164400	Okay.
9164400	9165560	You're completely on it, like,
9165560	9166880	right before off of those, it is.
9166880	9168520	That's okay, but that's what you tell me,
9168520	9169360	and then I,
9169360	9170200	So, it's a matter of thinking.
9170200	9171280	I'm trying to assess you.
9171280	9172120	He, he, he, he.
9172120	9172960	The wrong thing is,
9172960	9175080	the people are being straight up.
9175080	9175920	Yep.
9175920	9179040	I mean, I think underlying related,
9179040	9180520	you know, they're wrong,
9180520	9184720	and we do this job for the right reasons.
9184720	9186200	There are bad apples out there,
9186200	9189160	and that's not what you've got across.
9189200	9190040	That's right.
9192040	9195440	I think the fact that when we listen to you,
9195440	9197920	and we ask you questions about model,
9197920	9199600	that's not a concern, you know?
9199600	9202280	That's not even worse than having a family to report.
9202280	9204040	And you've been through that.
9204040	9205560	You know, you have a history.
9205560	9206400	I have,
9206400	9208440	but I have to also question you and think,
9208440	9210440	well, you know, I mean, I could be any way,
9210440	9211560	what if I'm the bad guy,
9211560	9212760	and I'm sitting here talking to you.
9212760	9214760	So do you have to figure out,
9214760	9215600	where am I,
9215600	9217440	am I the good person or the bad person, right?
9217440	9218640	I told you my side of the story.
9218640	9220520	Of course, I'm gonna make myself look good.
9220520	9222600	You guys have to do your background on me.
9222600	9224120	So I figured, have you already done it?
9224120	9225280	If I would not be sitting here,
9225280	9226120	if you hadn't done it,
9226120	9228040	I'd already figured out I was the good guy.
9228040	9229800	So I'm gonna have to trust you on that.
9229800	9230720	That's what I,
9230720	9233760	now I could be jumping to conclusions here,
9233760	9235720	but that's why I figured it is happening, right?
9235720	9237000	So you're right on that part,
9237000	9239560	because I wouldn't bring you in here
9239560	9241040	in a situation like this,
9241040	9242640	if you were my target, right?
9242640	9244560	If you were my target, you were the rest of you.
9244560	9245400	Right, right.
9246480	9247320	That being said,
9247800	9249520	we're still trying to figure each other out, right?
9249520	9250360	Yeah.
9250360	9251680	We need to figure out what our role is,
9251680	9252920	and we're trying to figure out
9252920	9255000	if you've got any information that can help us.
9255000	9257400	So, what, oh, databases?
9257400	9259640	Yes, I do have OCCP,
9260480	9263080	and I did have all of MLA stuff too,
9263080	9265560	Hunter.Log, actually it's still available,
9265560	9266960	Hunter Archives.
9266960	9267800	Okay.
9267800	9270720	And the ICIJ,
9270720	9271560	and I've got,
9271560	9274720	I don't know, so that's the OCCP and,
9274720	9276200	what's Hunter?
9276200	9277440	If I could show up for a second,
9277440	9279560	I'd have admin access to you.
9279560	9280400	This is really good.
9280400	9281740	I got all the shit that I,
9281740	9286740	it was OCCP, yeah, thank you.
9288320	9291280	If you want my files,
9291280	9293080	you've been helping me up with your admin access.
9293080	9294280	I want to sell this shit, you know?
9294280	9297120	I can't be stuck looking at half the document.
9297120	9299480	If you want me to find the fucking money laundress,
9299480	9301480	you need to see the whole breadth of the thing.
9301480	9303360	I have to file the whole paper trail.
9303360	9305160	So, that's it.
9305160	9306800	So, what do they have on OCCP?
9306800	9307640	I've heard about it.
9307640	9309480	So much shit, so much shit.
9309480	9310400	Dude, it's great.
9310400	9312240	It's great, everything, everything.
9312240	9316080	Every, I mean, all my papers, you know, everything.
9316080	9318840	All my shit is there, you know?
9318840	9320640	All of MLA stuff is there.
9320640	9325000	So, Hunter Archives would be the OSC for MLA stuff.
9325000	9326720	And then that's what we got.
9326720	9329280	It was rated in Germany and one in America or something.
9329280	9330120	Which is a shame,
9330120	9331720	because it was like a public service at Archives.
9331720	9333240	It was really good.
9333240	9338320	But it's like a, that was her big coup d'etger out there,
9338320	9341200	her big tiara on her head sort of thing.
9341200	9343760	What's the word I'm talking about here?
9343760	9344600	Her baby or what?
9344600	9345760	Yeah, whatever it is.
9345760	9349880	But it's also, that's like one 20th of the OCCP.
9349880	9352160	Who's at the best of what's the important?
9353720	9356160	You know, I don't think she's important.
9356160	9357440	Actually, I think she's full of shit.
9357440	9359360	She says, oh, we used to work for the CIA,
9359360	9361000	but I can't tell you.
9361040	9363440	Like one of those old, you know, isn't that community?
9363440	9365280	Did Emma Bester reeling or?
9365280	9367200	I don't know, okay.
9367200	9369280	All I know is that I think she is a,
9370280	9372320	I'm still trying to figure out,
9372320	9376280	in that, you know, in any pejorative manner.
9376280	9379480	But I think she was a man first,
9379480	9381320	and then became a woman, or was she a woman who became a,
9381320	9382280	I don't even know that.
9382280	9384920	I just know it's some sort of gender change.
9384920	9388480	And I know that her boyfriend or girlfriend,
9388480	9390960	I don't know if she was also a man first,
9390960	9393680	but I do know that he slash she is kind of an asshole,
9393680	9394640	and that's it.
9394640	9399640	It's like the kind of person that asked for money,
9400080	9402480	and then, like, we need money,
9402480	9404360	we need help because we have an autistic child.
9404360	9406360	And how do you say no to that?
9406360	9408760	You know, but then they sort of say,
9408760	9412960	go fuck yourself if you have an idea that they don't have.
9412960	9413960	Like in this one group,
9413960	9418960	but a friend of mine was just trying to actually bear it.
9419200	9420960	I was like, yeah, you know,
9420960	9424560	what do we do, don't attack this person at this turn,
9424560	9425400	that this,
9428120	9431120	I'm sort of a lawyer that I can't think of.
9431120	9433640	I'm using my speed here,
9433640	9437000	but a nonprofit, some sort of nonprofit,
9437000	9439200	don't attack the specific lawyer because he's a good guy.
9439200	9440840	And then she says, fuck you, he's a terrible guy.
9440840	9442480	You can attack whoever the fuck I want.
9442480	9447080	And this is Emma's partner, it stops.
9447120	9450520	You know, they're, they heard his or anything?
9450520	9453800	Zen, is there a fake name, X-A-N?
9453800	9454640	No, X-A-N.
9454640	9457840	Yeah, but I think she's, like,
9457840	9461120	it was a whole, it's a dramatically stupid,
9461120	9463680	but it's like, but there was this whole drama yesterday
9463680	9468680	about she's working in a diner and she got sad
9469040	9471760	and she started crying, she couldn't contain her feelings,
9471760	9475120	and it was all melodramatic, and like, so what?
9475120	9475960	What are you trying to say?
9475960	9477880	If you want money, just say, can I have money?
9477880	9479400	Because we will respect you more
9479400	9481040	if you just come out and ask for it.
9481040	9482840	Instead of telling us how sad you are,
9482840	9485240	but you have to work in a diner, right?
9485240	9486600	If you say, fuck you for saying that,
9486600	9488960	and that's the sort of, no, I don't mean it, right?
9488960	9489800	You just want it back?
9489800	9493080	Yeah, yeah, you know, it's like, it's enough.
9493080	9494320	You want money?
9494320	9498800	Yeah, you know, and, yeah, so.
9498800	9501160	So is it saying a hacker or is he just doing
9501160	9505160	one of these, yeah, to be honest with you, okay.
9505160	9510160	I, so I felt like I hacked Deutsche Bank,
9510280	9511640	although I didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
9511640	9514120	I felt like I did a pretty good job of hacking it,
9514120	9516440	not directly, I didn't go into their servers and do it,
9516440	9518880	but I fucking hacked that bank.
9518880	9522160	And it, well, not maybe in the sense of a hacker,
9522160	9523480	you probably, if you're a proper hacker,
9523480	9524320	you would not see it.
9524320	9526000	But in social engineering and all the people,
9526000	9527440	when McKaylee Faisola went to jail,
9527440	9529640	I put the fucking bail, too, all right?
9530760	9532600	I got all the data, exposed everything,
9532600	9533840	and there's still more to come,
9533840	9535360	which you don't know about, all right?
9535360	9536920	There's a lot more to come, yes.
9538080	9541160	So I, so when Emma's guy, I forgot his name,
9541160	9546160	the Wolfsack, the Spanish guy, hacked the Cayman Islands,
9546920	9548240	right?
9548240	9550040	That was a great one, by the way, it's good stuff.
9550040	9552200	What happened with Cayman?
9552200	9553520	I just don't know about it.
9553520	9555800	Well, for me, it was on this, you don't know about it?
9555800	9556640	It was here, right?
9556640	9557960	Yeah, yeah.
9557960	9558960	I missed it, I'm sorry.
9558960	9559800	Oh, it's great.
9559800	9560640	That's definitely hacking news.
9560640	9563880	No, I guess this guy was on the service for like a year,
9563880	9566200	and it was just, I think he took all the Bitcoin,
9566200	9567480	like all of it.
9567480	9569880	And so he said, hey, anybody out there hack a bank,
9569880	9572400	I'm gonna give you $100,000 of Bitcoin.
9572400	9573240	So I'm like, you know what?
9573240	9574440	Hey, Emma, could you tell your friend,
9574440	9576480	I think I deserve at least a run-in
9576480	9578320	for this $100,000 in Bitcoin,
9578320	9580080	because although I did not hack Deutsche Bank,
9580080	9581040	that's why I'm trying to work.
9581040	9582480	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9582480	9583840	And so Emma's like, no, you didn't,
9583840	9584920	you didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
9584920	9587720	but she didn't say, oh, let me pass on the message.
9587720	9589400	She didn't say, oh, hold on a second,
9589400	9593000	she just immediately responded as if she was the hacker.
9593000	9597760	So I suspected that it's possible that she's the hacker.
9597760	9598800	I've always thought she was,
9598800	9599960	because I always ask her.
9601400	9602600	Like I'm incriminating myself,
9602600	9604320	but I'm constantly asking like, Emma,
9604320	9605560	can you figure out how to do this?
9605560	9606600	Can you hack this shit for me?
9606600	9608320	Because I can't get past this point, you know?
9608320	9611320	Like with the, for example, David Enrich,
9614080	9617640	we have so much more, oh, this would be something
9617720	9619560	maybe you could help me with.
9619560	9622120	So many efforts and incriminates him
9622120	9624520	with so many fucking terrible things that he's done
9624520	9625920	and all the shit he's done for me.
9625920	9627560	It was all in signal.
9627560	9630120	And I took my phone to get the screen fix at the Apple Store
9630120	9632920	and I said, whatever you do, do not reset the phone.
9632920	9635680	And the fucking, the hacker has reset the phone.
9635680	9636760	And so I lost it all.
9636760	9638440	But I think it's an iPhone's success,
9638440	9640240	so it's not irretrievable.
9640240	9642400	It's still on the fucking phone.
9642400	9644320	But I cannot get the keys.
9644320	9645600	I don't know how to get the fucking keys yet.
9646360	9648400	It's been the slowest thing I've ever learned.
9648400	9650960	But I've got the tar ball, I've extracted the messages,
9650960	9652560	but I cannot get the fucking encryption keys
9652560	9654320	because I can't find them on the phone.
9654320	9655480	That's where I'm stuck.
9655480	9658840	It's like, that was, well, Alconov.
9658840	9661960	iOS, Frenzik edition.
9661960	9666960	iOS, Frenzik, it's just toolkits.
9668440	9671200	iOS, Frenzik, toolkits, it's a quick thing to do.
9671200	9672520	I mean, at least from my experience,
9672520	9677320	Alconov isn't like a great novel with Frenzik utility.
9677320	9680440	Like, I've played around with it, but I didn't use it because,
9680440	9682320	like, they don't automatically decrypt stuff
9682320	9685400	because, like, most normal Frenzik's programs do.
9685400	9686240	Really?
9686240	9687560	All right.
9687560	9689720	I'll talk to you about the free one.
9689720	9690560	Autopsy?
9690560	9691400	Is it good?
9691400	9692240	Autopsy's not bad.
9692240	9694320	I mean, that's a free one that anyone can download, isn't it?
9694320	9695560	It's a bunch of other ones that, I think,
9695560	9697360	a better job than Alconov.
9697360	9698360	Yeah.
9698360	9700400	I just, well, it's because I spent the money.
9700400	9701720	You know, it's having expenses,
9701760	9703440	so I feel like I have to learn it.
9703440	9704280	Yeah.
9708120	9708960	I don't know.
9708960	9710920	Another company that kind of delved into mobile,
9710920	9711760	it does just my opinion.
9711760	9713080	No, no, no, you're right.
9713080	9717280	They're really famous because of the thing with the photographs
9717280	9718480	in 2015, right?
9718480	9720440	So, like, they're kind of, right in their hotel,
9720440	9722280	now they have a mobile Frenzik thing that they're like,
9722280	9723760	well, if we put this out and they trust their name,
9723760	9724600	then we'll use it.
9724600	9725800	But, just from my experience,
9725800	9727200	I just haven't had much success with it.
9727200	9728560	Did you try Axiom?
9728560	9729400	I used Axiom.
9729400	9730240	What do you think of that one?
9730240	9731080	That's not bad.
9731080	9732000	It's a lot of good functionality.
9732000	9733520	Yeah, it's pretty strong.
9733520	9734360	Yeah.
9734360	9735520	It's very good.
9735520	9737640	So then I figured out you can just get pre-trials,
9737640	9741840	if you just say you're extending the pre-trials.
9743840	9744680	But yeah.
9744680	9749680	So you think that Beth is, she actually is a NSA, CIA?
9750280	9753560	No, I think it's worse than full of shit, yeah.
9753560	9756040	But do you think that she's a hacker?
9756040	9756880	I do.
9756880	9758360	I personally, I do think so.
9758360	9760320	I know no one else seems to be sure of my thing,
9760320	9762760	but I do think that she's a hacker.
9762760	9766520	I'm always trying to ask her to do it for some help,
9766520	9770240	but she's the one that introduced me to Elkheimsoft.
9770240	9772800	I said, I have this problem with the signal messages.
9772800	9773640	What do you recommend?
9773640	9775480	She said, Elkheimsoft, ILS, forensic.
9778840	9780200	What do you mean, Jimmy?
9780200	9782040	I don't know.
9782040	9784480	Again, again, right, it's too open-ended.
9784480	9786400	And she texted me the other day.
9786400	9789640	She's like, if you've spoken to FBI,
9789640	9791880	I said, no, I'm not speaking to FBI.
9791880	9794040	She's like, well, are you sure?
9794040	9795280	I was like, well, I'm not lying to you.
9795280	9797880	I was talking to the FBI, like, you know,
9797880	9800360	I will let you know when I speak to FBI.
9800360	9804480	So I go, well, you're kind of known as an FBI informant.
9804480	9806280	I said, well, fuck you, I'm not an informant.
9806280	9808520	I'm a source, like, help the FBI.
9808520	9810680	I do not inform anybody.
9810680	9812400	And then she's like, well, it's kind of the same thing.
9812400	9813640	And then I had to go on an entire raid
9813640	9815520	to explain how it's very different.
9815520	9818640	So we'll let you know that she is probably,
9818640	9822320	and also yesterday, one of my friends, Andrew,
9822320	9824280	had to defend me on this group as well,
9824280	9827480	because Xan was saying, your friend
9827480	9830280	with a well-known FBI informant, which is me,
9830280	9832080	which is another illusion to me.
9832080	9834240	So it's Xan.
9834240	9836480	Oh, Xan is telling you.
9836480	9838800	Xan's the partner of Emma.
9838800	9842720	So she's saying to who that you're a friend of mine
9842720	9843600	in our group.
9843600	9846840	Oh, so your friend is, Xan is acting your friend
9846840	9847880	for being friends with you?
9847880	9848880	Yes.
9848880	9849380	Oh, OK.
9849380	9849880	Sorry.
9849880	9852360	Exactly.
9852360	9853360	OK.
9853360	9855920	I mean, it's obviously a little different,
9855920	9858080	and I don't know if you understand.
9858080	9859080	This is weird drama.
9859080	9863080	It's like, yeah, there are many people with a group like that.
9863080	9865560	I think this, you know, I'm like 96, I think.
9865560	9866800	Oh, wow.
9866800	9869080	That's why it's too many people.
9869080	9871160	And there's too many lurkers, and there's too many new
9871160	9872960	and fresh, like, mid-dag identity,
9872960	9876040	so there's already a bunch of substratas,
9876040	9878720	and some groups are coming from that group.
9878720	9882240	And what's funny is they're all, well, I mean,
9882240	9883480	I'll tell you, it's not a big deal.
9883480	9886240	It's with all Barrett's friends.
9886240	9888520	Barrett's so, like, it's so weird.
9888520	9891400	I don't know how he does it, but he's, you know.
9891400	9894760	Because you might, of the 96, you might know how many people
9894760	9896680	in real life are in that group.
9896680	9898440	Like, women in real life.
9898440	9901040	Well, I guess, like, who they really are.
9901040	9902880	Oh, I know about half of them.
9902880	9903380	Yeah.
9903380	9905800	Like, into the other half, or like, lurker or something.
9906520	9910480	Yeah, but we have people that try and check them out
9910480	9912840	and figure out who these people are.
9912840	9914560	Like, once in a while, you'll get it right,
9914560	9916880	and we can serve it, you know, coming in there
9916880	9920680	and trying to spout a bunch of crazy shit, and kick him out.
9920680	9923040	And then, I noticed, someone loses a phone.
9923040	9924720	Like, it happened recently, and then all of a sudden,
9924720	9928160	we have to, it's been compromised, the FBI's in.
9928160	9929880	I'm sure you, was that you?
9929880	9931520	I don't know.
9931520	9931960	Was it you?
9931960	9932680	Okay, somebody.
9932680	9933680	I don't know what you're talking about.
9933680	9935560	I don't know, somebody.
9935560	9941680	Oh, and that, oh, shit, wait, I'm Junco.
9941680	9943160	Did you call Barrett?
9943160	9945640	I think he recorded a phone call with you.
9945640	9946480	I hadn't called Barrett.
9946480	9947320	You hadn't called Barrett?
9947320	9952560	There was a different FBI agent that was trying to,
9952560	9957240	he was going to, I think it was some white racist,
9957240	9959560	nationalist fucking weird shit.
9959560	9962280	And he was someone else who was working, white racist.
9962280	9965160	Yeah, he used to know, but I remember the name
9965160	9967240	of Junco actually rings a bell.
9967240	9969200	And I was, I was going to tell you the other day,
9969200	9970760	but I had to figure out what it was first.
9970760	9972240	But now I just remembered again, I probably
9972240	9974760	should not be talking right now and saying it out loud,
9974760	9977420	but I am.
9977420	9983080	But there is something, there is something,
9983080	9984880	something secret.
9984880	9985760	Secret is going to be right now.
9985760	9986640	Okay?
9986640	9988840	You don't know who the person is.
9988840	9989800	Were you there?
9989800	9990960	He's only, he's the one who realized?
9990960	9992080	No.
9992080	9992880	Does he know Barrett?
9992880	9994400	Have you got him in question?
9994400	9997000	I know, I know, I've never met a person.
9997000	9999360	Oh, well, I mean, I have met, yes,
9999360	10001320	there's a few people I know first,
10001320	10004400	but I can't, like my friends, I'm not gonna tell you, yeah.
10006160	10008480	Getting a sense of the group, like, any other.
10008480	10010760	Let me show you, like, the most recent thing.
10012600	10013440	Let's see.
10020240	10021440	Ooh, someone's trying to,
10022440	10025680	Hey, you guys, who's trying to hack me now?
10025680	10026520	You got a thing?
10026520	10027360	No.
10027360	10028320	Don't click on the link.
10028320	10029920	What was it? What did you get?
10029920	10031200	No, I just got one of these things.
10031200	10032880	I think it's my girlfriend.
10032880	10035120	Who's using the other computer?
10035120	10036160	Oh, he's.
10036160	10037440	No, that's not what that says.
10037440	10038280	That's my girlfriend.
10038280	10039880	He's finding it really fucking awesome.
10039880	10041000	Yeah, I know.
10041000	10044440	It's, like, it's funny enough, the other computer
10044440	10045520	is Gwen Simpson's.
10046520	10047600	What was that?
10047600	10049600	Yeah, it was the Fusion GCat.
10050600	10051800	The Steal Dacian.
10054960	10056320	I mean, like, there's a lot of stuff
10056320	10057160	that I probably shouldn't know,
10057160	10059800	but I just don't, I mean, it's kind of like.
10059800	10061320	You didn't follow the Steal Dacian?
10061320	10062320	The whole Trump Russia?
10062320	10063160	No, I didn't know about it,
10063160	10064760	but, like, I didn't follow that much.
10064760	10066800	Anyway, I said, I lived at his house for a while,
10066800	10068400	at Gwen's house, yeah.
10068400	10069560	And he didn't pay me half the money
10069560	10071560	he was supposed to, so I took the computer.
10072240	10073600	Wait, is that, yeah.
10077600	10079800	Oh, and yeah, and there's a whole Russian spy thing
10079800	10081120	going on, too.
10081120	10082440	What's the Russian spy thing?
10084280	10089000	So there's, so I was telling Tim and Jami as well,
10089000	10091840	but they're sort of, they're things, so I don't know.
10091840	10093360	Am I supposed to mix things together?
10093360	10096120	But if Tim's aware of it, like, I would use the hot tin.
10096120	10097120	Let me tell Tim first.
10097120	10097960	Let me tell Tim first.
10097960	10098800	Okay.
10098800	10100560	Well, I should ask him if it's okay
10101520	10103400	Yeah, I mean, if Tim already knows about it,
10103400	10105960	he would, like, I don't worry that type of stuff either,
10105960	10108160	so, like, I would just tell someone else to.
10108160	10111160	Yeah, would he, would he tell me the, uh,
10111160	10113200	interior or the exterior?
10113200	10115160	Like, like, what, the United States
10115160	10116840	or outside of the United States?
10116840	10119160	Are we looking for a Russian hacker
10119160	10121560	or are we looking for a, everything?
10121560	10122400	Yeah?
10122400	10124640	Dude, that would be fun for me.
10124640	10125680	I would like to catch people.
10125680	10127840	I like, I can, I can do that.
10127840	10129840	But if money, the money is my specialty.
10130680	10132920	That's what I'm, better than the hacker.
10136680	10137520	Cool.
10137520	10138360	All right.
10138360	10140760	Do you need to send someone for something?
10140760	10142000	Oh, yeah, sorry.
10142000	10144600	No, I just got, I need to eat something.
10144600	10145440	My brain is...
10145440	10146720	You don't think you're gonna eat something?
10146720	10149160	Yeah, could we take a cigarette break or something?
10149160	10150120	Is it okay?
10150120	10150960	Yeah.
10150960	10151800	Yeah?
10151800	10154640	All right, let's do it.
10154640	10156480	What do you want?
10156480	10157760	No, no, no, I just...
10157760	10159280	Yeah, I want sandwiches, then.
10159280	10160120	Really?
10160120	10160960	Yeah.
10160960	10161800	What kind of sandwich?
10161800	10163320	A sandwich or...
10163320	10164160	Okay.
10164160	10166160	Sure, well, yeah, I'd love one.
10168160	10169360	Gratsen, that's nice.
10169360	10171520	I'll put on a mask or whatever.
10171520	10173240	Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
10175720	10176920	What was I gonna show you?
10176920	10179600	At the time, you're...
10181080	10184560	Look, I don't know allegiance to these guys at all.
10184560	10187520	I mean, they've just, they've become sort of friends, but,
10188520	10191600	you know, as much as you can have a friend on that,
10193080	10196840	that doesn't tell you anything about that, right?
10196840	10199520	It's just sort of fun, more fun sort of.
10202200	10203120	Like, you're in the workplace,
10203120	10205840	you're not friends with all your workers, right?
10205840	10207160	No, I don't feel right for now.
10209160	10211480	Oh, yeah, I'll hit the head, you know where it is, right?
10211480	10212320	Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
10212320	10213320	You guys are just gonna go...
10213320	10214800	But I'll wait for you, because you can't fit out.
10214800	10215640	Oh, that's right.
10218520	10222600	So what's your specialty?
10222600	10224720	No, same, but I just happened to work in this office.
10224720	10225560	In this office?
10225560	10227920	Right, so, if you say, like, laundry.
10227920	10228760	Yeah?
10228760	10232640	Of course, he, you know, he flew here to speak to you,
10232640	10236200	so let him, let him, yeah, yeah, he flew here yesterday.
10236200	10237120	I didn't know it was just for me,
10237120	10238120	I just thought he was coming here
10238120	10239240	and I wanted to speak to you while he was here.
10239240	10243920	Yeah, so, for me, like, when you're in management,
10243920	10245840	I'm like, oh, okay, like, a lot of these guys on the floor
10245840	10248560	do, like, business email compromise, and a lot of guys,
10248560	10249400	like...
10249400	10250240	Did you, what?
10250240	10251240	I didn't hear you.
10251240	10252480	Business email compromise?
10252480	10253320	Oh, really?
10253320	10254840	Yeah, I don't know, okay.
10254840	10255960	That's easy, yeah.
10255960	10259120	Yeah, so, business email compromise, and then...
10259120	10260080	Is that a term for it?
10260080	10261280	Just business email compromise?
10261280	10262440	There's a, I didn't know there was a term for it.
10262440	10263880	Yeah, so a lot of things out of Nigeria,
10263880	10265200	and it's just funny, when you mentioned
10265200	10267280	you're not lobbying, is there a thing like...
10268360	10269720	Yeah, one of our guys over here,
10269720	10273120	they just got someone out of, like, Dubai,
10273120	10274080	or something like that.
10274080	10274920	Yeah, okay.
10275040	10275880	Cool.
10275880	10279200	And they're digging into that versus something like,
10279200	10281520	they're special to you, like, laundering,
10281520	10282600	laundering money, right?
10282600	10285480	So, like, romance, victim, romance scam victims,
10285480	10286560	like a victimized...
10286560	10288480	Oh, yeah, I heard that.
10288480	10291520	Eventually, he gets out to, like, Canada, China,
10291520	10292640	or all these other countries,
10292640	10294840	and there's, like, a whole money mule network
10294840	10296240	that's, like, pretty tough to...
10296240	10297080	Is it really?
10297080	10297920	Is it like a company?
10297920	10299080	Is it one person behind it, or is it...
10299080	10301520	No, no, no, it's all a loose connection, yeah.
10301520	10302360	Loose.
10302360	10303200	Interesting.
10303200	10306800	It's like a, like, a lead in welding connections
10306800	10310960	sort of thing, like, there was a...
10310960	10312960	Basically, like, very, very...
10312960	10314200	And they all know each other in person,
10314200	10315040	that's the difference.
10315040	10315880	Oh, they do?
10315880	10316720	They know each other, it's like,
10316720	10317560	oh, you know this guy?
10317560	10320040	He's leading, interested in, you know,
10320040	10323080	doing some work, opening bank accounts, and stuff like that.
10323080	10324640	Ah, I understand that, yeah.
10324640	10327440	So, like, they're friends in Nigeria?
10327440	10329440	Or in the community?
10329440	10331440	Shit, you know we did?
10331440	10334400	We had to, like, this lawyer was essentially an asshole.
10334400	10338040	He said, we need your narrative to store ACP for Monday.
10338040	10341120	So, I went on the Fiverr, and I tried to find it.
10341120	10341960	Oh, Fiverr.
10341960	10344120	It's a narrative of Marie's story.
10344120	10345320	Fiverr.
10345320	10346800	So, I went on Fiverr?
10346800	10347640	Oh, sure.
10350080	10351080	I went on Fiverr.
10351080	10351920	Really?
10351920	10355320	I found someone to do a live transcription
10355320	10356800	and it's a Nigerian guy.
10356800	10360120	He wanted to be paid in Bitcoin yesterday or tomorrow.
10360200	10362960	And Marie says, no, I'm not gonna pay you that.
10362960	10365440	And then he says, okay, and that's it.
10365440	10370440	So, I'm thinking, well, he just got all of Marie's
10370440	10372440	information since she was a child.
10372440	10375440	So, he should probably pay the guy, right?
10375440	10377280	It's a new scam, I think.
10377280	10378560	You're doing transcription services,
10378560	10381360	get your private data, and then sell that data.
10381360	10382960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
10382960	10384480	Nigerian's committing fraud.
10384480	10385320	What do you mean?
10387320	10390080	Like crazy, you know, connoisseurs, yes.
10390080	10393920	I mean, they're in that rush, they're doing good stuff.
10395480	10397800	Why isn't that, why is that the hotbed here,
10397800	10399320	criminal activity?
10399320	10402240	I don't know, it's what's called like training, you know?
10402240	10403080	Training stuff.
10403080	10403920	You're gonna wait here real quick?
10403920	10404760	Okay.
10406360	10408320	You think they train each other and like,
10408320	10409960	you know, it's like, hey, you know,
10409960	10411640	you grow up with all these people and like,
10411640	10413840	hey, you want to make a cash and then they say,
10413840	10415840	all you gotta do is you send out these emails,
10415840	10417640	there's this script and whatever,
10417640	10419080	and then they teach other people.
10420200	10422720	It's like any other criminal organization.
10422720	10424240	That's the way it works, it's all good.
10424240	10426000	Right now, I guess they're,
10426000	10427120	I haven't been looking around right here,
10427120	10428880	but they're like in protest right now?
10428880	10429720	Oh, really?
10429720	10432200	I don't see anything, so Pat's gonna cut it off.
10432200	10433040	I'm gonna say there's no, like,
10433040	10434800	see any signers or whatever.
10434800	10436440	Yeah, that'd be bad.
10436440	10437280	Yeah, exactly.
10437280	10438280	Yeah, I don't know why that.
10438280	10439120	Yeah.
10441320	10442640	Huh.
10442640	10443840	Where are they protesting?
10445000	10446440	There's the answer, you know?
10448280	10449800	Don't join, pal.
10449840	10451320	Don't do it, don't do it.
10452720	10454800	You guys get a bad rap, you know?
10454800	10456760	Like seriously, I was like everybody else
10456760	10458520	until I met Tim and Jenny.
10458520	10459360	Yeah.
10459360	10460200	And then I was like, you know,
10460200	10463040	I can't believe I considered you guys people, guys.
10463040	10465120	What are you doing here, dude?
10465120	10467760	You just being careful on me, yeah.
10467760	10469680	How'd you guys get started on this?
10469680	10471920	I don't know, I just started a little while ago.
10471920	10473440	I always wanted to do it as a kid.
10473440	10474280	Yeah?
10474280	10475520	Here I am, so I'm talking to Dad.
10475520	10476840	Did you good do the whole training
10476840	10478840	and either you taught you everything now
10478880	10480000	or did you know before?
10480000	10481000	Not much, not much.
10482560	10484360	Oh, for the computer stuff I went to,
10484360	10485880	my degree is in there.
10485880	10486720	Oh, it is?
10486720	10487560	I don't know about that.
10487560	10489960	I'm like, oh no, but yeah,
10489960	10491200	fan thing is I want to do it as a kid
10491200	10494600	and then easily enough, you just apply online, everything.
10494600	10495640	Yeah.
10495640	10498400	Yeah, so it's not like you know a guy or whatever.
10498400	10499760	No, that's cool, that's cool.
10499760	10500600	Interesting.
10500600	10501440	How lucky.
10501440	10503000	That's good.
10503000	10503960	Yeah, I'll give you a quick peep.
10503960	10506080	This is what it's like, you can scroll around.
10506080	10508720	It's not that, it's not a cool, great, crazy day
10508720	10511080	that I keep, it's not what you think.
10511080	10511920	Cool.
10521920	10523000	I'm not for rockin'.
10523000	10523840	What's wrong?
10523840	10525560	I'm not for rockin', it's business.
10525560	10527600	I assume these are not like real people, right?
10527600	10528920	No, they're not real people.
10528920	10531480	I mean, they're not their real names.
10531480	10534480	Some of them, I mean, I use my real name.
10534480	10535480	That's your friend.
10535560	10536760	I use his real name.
10536760	10537600	Oh.
10537600	10539360	I think Barry uses his real name.
10539360	10542240	Conlon, I don't know, kind of, Doc Rockett is a,
10542240	10544840	I can't remember, I used to read through it again.
10544840	10546240	I used to know what everybody was, but.
10546240	10547920	He's too many secrets, you know?
10547920	10550080	Oh, that guy's great, yeah, I do.
10550080	10551760	Let me tell them.
10551760	10553880	He doesn't do anything illegal.
10553880	10556240	He's like, he's just like a researcher.
10556240	10557640	He's not even that good.
10557640	10559360	He's got a couple of databases in there.
10559360	10561240	He's just very loyal and helpful.
10561240	10562360	It's a little, yeah.
10562360	10563880	So if anyone needs my help, I'll do that.
10564320	10565520	Kind of nice thing.
10565520	10567920	So there are no film crews outside,
10567920	10568760	but you never know.
10568760	10571640	They could show up to your comfort level.
10571640	10572480	Okay, let's go.
10572480	10575160	At the same time, the protest is like
10575160	10577920	about salons wanting to open.
10577920	10579040	That's what, salons?
10579040	10580240	Yeah, like salons.
10580240	10581560	Okay.
10581560	10582400	Cool.
10582400	10583240	Let's join.
10583240	10584240	A bit of a carry.
10584240	10586440	Oh, that's what we really did there.
10586440	10587760	Oh, thank you.
10587760	10590040	That was pretty good, though.
10590040	10591560	I mean, I give you credit.
10594880	10598080	God, it's split ends.
10598080	10599400	Okay, there you go.
10602400	10604440	So yeah, it's not that it's fun.
10604440	10606920	It's mostly just people yelling.
10606920	10609040	During like, you know, Joe,
10609040	10610520	I'm sure you know Joe Fiona.
10611800	10613080	Who's Joe Fiona?
10613080	10615040	Joe is like, what's his name?
10615040	10616440	Sub-Zero?
10616440	10617360	Sub-Zero?
10617360	10618200	What's his name?
10618200	10620040	I think in 2000.
10620040	10621520	I'm talking about the moral product character.
10621520	10622360	I don't know.
10622360	10623200	I don't know.
10623200	10624040	It's his name.
10624040	10624880	He's alias.
10626000	10627480	He's pretty, he's a clever guy.
10627480	10628520	He was in the,
10628520	10629720	did you see the Hacker War film?
10629720	10632040	That's the film that women did with Barrett.
10634040	10636720	It's basically the guy that's talking all the time.
10636720	10638920	And wearing a suit, that guy.
10638920	10640000	Okay.
10640000	10642040	Joe, is he a hacker?
10642040	10644920	I think, yeah, he's like a, yeah.
10644920	10645880	Okay.
10645880	10647520	So he's like, he's friends with Barrett.
10647520	10648920	Is that how he got in the group?
10648920	10651320	Yeah, these old friends of Barrett.
10651320	10652160	Cool.
10652160	10655240	He's one of his old friends of Barrett, man.
10655240	10656960	So what did Joe do?
10656960	10658280	Joe, I'm not quite sure.
10658280	10660360	I think he goes cycling a lot.
10661600	10663880	He spends most of his time cycling
10663880	10664720	during the year.
10666400	10667600	He's a, everyone,
10667600	10669880	but these guys are fairly optimistic, you know,
10669880	10672200	based, which is great and all.
10672200	10674880	I'm not really a, you know,
10674880	10677320	I mean, I guess I don't believe anything that strongly
10677320	10679080	to go out and carry a sign.
10679080	10679920	Sure.
10679960	10681880	But I'm sure, you know,
10682960	10686600	I mean, if someone DCFS right now,
10686600	10688520	of course, I think I would probably carry a sign.
10688520	10691000	So I'm like, it hasn't hit me personally yet.
10693160	10694960	I mean, that's a really popular corner.
10694960	10695800	Yeah, wow.
10695800	10697040	Just because it's like one of the,
10697040	10697880	you hear it over there.
10697880	10699200	Yeah, this would be okay.
10700760	10701960	It's really far away.
10710920	10712920	I can push a little bit over there.
10712920	10713760	Sure.
10715760	10716600	Oh, really?
10716600	10717440	Oh, man.
10719440	10722400	So, yeah, I mean, just like everyone,
10722400	10723520	the people who use their real names
10723520	10726080	really aren't afraid of the guy finding out.
10726080	10728120	So, I'm sure you, yeah.
10730120	10733600	But the, yeah, there was another interesting thing.
10735160	10736880	God, I can't remember why they say code.
10737160	10739000	I'm running to show you the thing.
10739000	10740320	I can almost guarantee you.
10740320	10742840	It's not me, because I'm not that important.
10742840	10744800	No, but you were from Houston,
10744800	10746800	and Barrett said it was a guy from Houston
10746800	10748680	that called a friend of his
10748680	10750720	that was trying to infiltrate some group,
10750720	10752040	but he was on the wrong group.
10752040	10754040	I don't know exactly what happened.
10754040	10755200	We got a recording of the phone call.
10755200	10756520	I wanted to play back the phone call
10756520	10758640	to see if that was you talking to this other guy.
10758640	10760240	Not Barrett directly, but someone else.
10760240	10762040	I would be interested if you got a recording
10762040	10763400	of me talking to someone.
10763400	10764240	I love you.
10764240	10765080	I love you.
10767280	10769280	Yeah, that's what I said with the code.
10772040	10772880	Okay.
10778320	10780640	Now, could you, is it possible that,
10781640	10786640	is it possible to have this guy,
10786920	10788080	that you've done your research,
10788080	10790560	you probably understand that Steve is not a good guy?
10790560	10791400	He's Steve.
10791400	10792240	Steve Tolts?
10793240	10795080	You've posted here on Facebook.
10795080	10798880	Yeah, like he's not a stand-up guy.
10798880	10799720	He's not a,
10801560	10804960	you know the type that's run to mom and the scribbling.
10804960	10805960	Yeah, not yet.
10808480	10811360	I think it's actually really become a threat
10811360	10815320	to not only tomorrow's update with the priest,
10815320	10816480	the priest that's happening.
10816480	10817480	Sure, no, I get it.
10818760	10821240	Is it possible to have him reported?
10822240	10823080	No.
10826680	10827520	Australia.
10829680	10834680	I went to a whole moral crisis.
10835880	10836920	Did I do this or not?
10836920	10839400	And I asked them, they said they'd do it.
10839400	10840240	But then I said,
10840240	10841520	but then all of a sudden I had this father,
10841520	10843080	I said, we're not going to do that tomorrow.
10843080	10844840	That was the bottom line.
10844840	10846000	But that was last year.
10846000	10848000	Yeah, that was last year.
10848000	10850080	But now everyone's really asking me,
10850200	10851040	I know.
10852520	10853360	Thank you.
10853360	10854360	Thank you.
10854360	10856360	Oh, good, good, good, good.
10860360	10861720	You're welcome.
10861720	10862720	I am the broker.
10862720	10864160	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
10865320	10866200	You actually thought about it.
10866200	10868640	I was like, I'm not fucking one out.
10868640	10869920	I was like, you know,
10869920	10872040	don't look at me, I did it on the right.
10872040	10873440	I did, I did it on the right.
10873440	10874440	That's all I got.
10875440	10877440	It's a little bit economic.
10877440	10880440	Because I was shopping in one town,
10880440	10883440	and this was like twice that.
10883440	10885440	I'm like, if you guys really eat it,
10885440	10886440	I can eat for a week.
10886440	10887440	That's true.
10894440	10896440	I don't think you guys realize how nice this weather is
10896440	10898440	for August, whatever.
10898440	10900440	Do you know Andrews?
10900440	10901440	I don't like this weather.
10901440	10903440	Do you know Andrews?
10903440	10904440	Who's Andrew?
10904440	10906440	The one you pointed out, my friend.
10906440	10907440	Your friend?
10907440	10908440	Yeah.
10908440	10909440	I mean, you just told me about him,
10909440	10910440	but I don't know.
10910440	10912440	Before I mentioned him.
10912440	10914440	He's a good, interesting character.
10914440	10915440	What's the deal?
10915440	10916440	He's a really good guy.
10916440	10917440	Good dude.
10918440	10919440	Do you remember, maybe,
10919440	10923440	probably in 2015 there was this article
10923440	10926440	in Bloomberg about
10927440	10928440	if there was this company,
10928440	10929440	and it turned out later,
10929440	10931440	you find out articles later,
10931440	10934440	that it was a Russian company,
10934440	10936440	they created this big deficit for people.
10936440	10937440	Someone would call you and say,
10937440	10939440	you owe us $2,000 a month,
10939440	10941440	and then you say,
10941440	10942440	you got this thing,
10942440	10943440	you forgot about it,
10943440	10944440	you should probably pay it.
10944440	10946440	Most people will pay that money.
10946440	10949440	If you will just create this big debt,
10949440	10951440	and it's a really fucking dollar,
10951440	10953440	and it's $1,000,000 a month.
10953440	10955440	So a lot of people would take the manager,
10955440	10956440	and people would just be doing that.
10956440	10958440	And they'd try to get it to Andrews.
10958440	10959440	They wouldn't call Andrew,
10959440	10961440	and they'd say, you owe us $5,000,
10961440	10962440	we're a combination of debts,
10962440	10963440	and they'd say,
10963440	10964440	oh my god,
10964440	10965440	I remember paying that back,
10965440	10967440	they didn't really owe us.
10967440	10969440	So he starts fighting and arguing with this guy,
10969440	10971440	until the guy threatens to go
10971440	10973440	and create this company.
10973440	10974440	Like, totally possible,
10974440	10975440	and Andrew said,
10975440	10976440	that's it.
10976440	10978440	So he starts doing like,
10978440	10979440	he's now,
10979440	10982440	he's the Liam Neeson thing,
10982440	10984440	I have three,
10984440	10985440	you know,
10985440	10987440	a few good things,
10987440	10988440	whatever the client is.
10988440	10989440	And that's pretty good.
10989440	10990440	So you reverse engineers,
10990440	10991440	it's brilliant what he did,
10991440	10992440	I love it.
10992440	10993440	Reverse engineers,
10993440	10994440	everyone that's called him,
10994440	10995440	and looks him up,
10995440	10996440	there's all the background on them,
10996440	10999440	gets them to give up more information on their,
10999440	11001440	just like you could do in any case.
11001440	11002440	You know,
11002440	11003440	give information to the guy at mob,
11003440	11004440	and the hierarchy,
11004440	11006440	all the way up to Weldon,
11006440	11007440	the congressman,
11007440	11009440	was he a senator or congressman?
11009440	11011440	Well, I'm a senator or something.
11011440	11012440	Is he Weldon?
11012440	11013440	No,
11013440	11014440	Josh Weldon,
11014440	11016440	or is he something Weldon?
11016440	11017440	Yeah, man,
11017440	11018440	I don't know all the senators
11018440	11019440	who represented him,
11019440	11020440	so I'm a bad,
11020440	11021440	he's an ex-servant.
11021440	11022440	But,
11022440	11023440	I mean,
11023440	11024440	he might be,
11024440	11025440	he might be actually,
11025440	11026440	I know he's a congressman person,
11026440	11027440	but that's about the ex-servant,
11027440	11028440	I know.
11028440	11029440	Yeah,
11029440	11030440	but he's in bed with a lot of,
11030440	11031440	the Russian companies,
11031440	11033440	they're creating these fake debt companies,
11033440	11035440	and it's a really good story,
11035440	11036440	it's great articles,
11036440	11037440	and it's just sort of reverse engineers,
11037440	11038440	put some in jail,
11038440	11040440	and it's a good guy at the store.
11040440	11041440	It's very impressed.
11041440	11042440	That's cool.
11042440	11043440	I mean,
11043440	11044440	he found me,
11044440	11045440	he just wanted to know
11045440	11046440	if I had any data
11046440	11047440	on those people as well,
11047440	11048440	like,
11048440	11049440	I was looking for Weldon,
11049440	11050440	the Russians,
11050440	11051440	the Tudmento,
11051440	11053440	or some other guy,
11053440	11055440	and that's how we became friends.
11055440	11056440	He's a good guy.
11056440	11057440	That's cool.
11057440	11059440	I thought he was already working with you guys.
11059440	11060440	I'm pretty sure he was,
11060440	11061440	I thought he was CIA.
11061440	11062440	Okay,
11062440	11063440	I mean,
11063440	11064440	so if he was CIA then,
11064440	11065440	I don't think he would.
11065440	11066440	That's what I thought.
11066440	11067440	I don't know.
11067440	11068440	Have you ever been in the,
11068440	11069440	like,
11069440	11070440	okay.
11070440	11071440	Yeah,
11071440	11072440	he came out to visit.
11072440	11073440	I don't know,
11073440	11075440	do you think he'd want to work with us?
11075440	11076440	I think he would.
11076440	11077440	I think he would,
11077440	11078440	actually.
11078440	11080440	Do you want to give me his contact information?
11080440	11082440	I think I'd have to ask him.
11082440	11083440	Okay.
11083440	11084440	And then,
11084440	11085440	if he'd never have to,
11085440	11086440	I'd bring it up.
11086440	11087440	Because I don't know,
11087440	11088440	he's like a,
11088440	11089440	like a really,
11089440	11092440	he almost pisses me off,
11092440	11093440	he's like,
11093440	11094440	too good.
11094440	11095440	He's like,
11095440	11097440	he reminds me of my father in the sense
11097440	11098440	of his morality.
11098440	11099440	He's very,
11099440	11100440	very strong.
11100440	11101440	That's good.
11101440	11102440	So that's the thing you guys like,
11102440	11103440	I mean,
11103440	11104440	you hire a lot of,
11104440	11105440	like,
11105440	11106440	Mormons, right?
11106440	11107440	So,
11107440	11108440	who's at the CIA?
11108440	11110440	Who's hiring all the Mormons?
11110440	11112440	They're doing a lot of good things.
11112440	11113440	Yeah, okay.
11113440	11114440	If they can pass the broadcast,
11114440	11115440	yeah.
11115440	11116440	Okay,
11116440	11117440	really the Mormons
11117440	11118440	can't pass the broadcast?
11118440	11119440	That's great.
11119440	11120440	Because they can't.
11120440	11121440	They cannot.
11121440	11122440	No, they can't.
11122440	11123440	Oh, they can't,
11123440	11124440	right?
11124440	11125440	Yeah.
11125440	11126440	Okay,
11126440	11127440	okay.
11127440	11128440	I mean,
11128440	11129440	the Mormons
11129440	11130440	a lot of time,
11130440	11131440	they do missions.
11131440	11132440	So when they go overseas,
11132440	11133440	they learn the language,
11133440	11134440	it's probably useful
11134440	11135440	for like,
11135440	11136440	CIA and all that kind of stuff.
11136440	11137440	Right,
11137440	11138440	good cover.
11138440	11139440	Yeah.
11139440	11140440	Yeah,
11140440	11141440	but it's so,
11141440	11142440	like,
11142440	11143440	we're so
11143440	11144440	strict with rules
11144440	11145440	and stuff.
11145440	11146440	How do you,
11146440	11147440	how do you,
11147440	11148440	justify one thing
11148440	11149440	or do something else?
11149440	11150440	That's a good question.
11150440	11151440	That's something
11151440	11152440	I've,
11152440	11153440	know nothing about.
11153440	11154440	Right.
11154440	11155440	Well,
11155440	11156440	being a Mormon
11156440	11157440	won't work for the agency.
11157440	11158440	Like,
11158440	11159440	how do you justify,
11159440	11160440	like,
11160440	11161440	a man,
11161440	11162440	a woman,
11162440	11163440	a man,
11163440	11164440	a man,
11164440	11165440	a man,
11165440	11166440	a man,
11166440	11167440	a man,
11167440	11168440	a man,
11168440	11169440	a man,
11169440	11170440	a man,
11170440	11171440	a man,
11171440	11172440	a man,
11172440	11173440	a man.
11173440	11174440	What do you guys
11174440	11175440	do?
11175440	11176440	Jesus,
11176440	11177440	people?
11177440	11178440	Can't see that.
11178440	11179440	Okay.
11179440	11180440	Do it or not do it?
11180440	11181440	No.
11181440	11182440	I wish there was.
11182440	11183440	Yeah,
11183440	11184440	I wish there was.
11184440	11185440	Yeah,
11185440	11186440	I wish there was.
11186440	11187440	Yeah,
11187440	11188440	I wish there was.
11188440	11194440	That's what's more impressive, what you need for me right away is the thing that you have on your plate.
11194440	11200440	What I can help you with, what you can do with the transactional for Marlowe's safety.
11200440	11204440	I would like to bro it, Steve.
11204440	11206440	Listen to me, sir.
11206440	11208440	Thank you.
11214440	11216440	Seriously, it caught me up.
11216440	11218440	Are you happy?
11218440	11220440	Maybe.
11220440	11222440	You've got to take off that pavilion.
11222440	11224440	Thank you.
11224440	11226440	Thank you very much.
11226440	11228440	You're welcome.
11228440	11230440	I like the economy with our mayor.
11230440	11232440	That's right.
11232440	11236440	I'm going to watch out for the mayor.
11246440	11254440	I would have to be really secretive if I now tell the mayor.
11254440	11256440	I can't tell her everything.
11256440	11260440	What I don't tell her, she always finds out.
11260440	11262440	What would you tell her?
11262440	11268440	I'm going to tell her, oh they offered me a job.
11268440	11272440	I'd be like, what are they paying down?
11272440	11274440	Not money.
11274440	11276440	It's a good job.
11276440	11278440	But they will have Marlowe.
11278440	11280440	They should say, trust them.
11280440	11282440	You can live with them.
11282440	11284440	See that?
11284440	11286440	You're the mayor.
11286440	11288440	I know.
11288440	11290440	Me?
11290440	11292440	She isn't a super.
11292440	11294440	She'll see you working on it.
11294440	11296440	What are you doing?
11296440	11298440	Okay, thanks.
11298440	11300440	I'll see you later.
11304440	11308440	It's fun to do an episode 7.
11308440	11312440	But I don't know how people will know.
11312440	11314440	I figured it was okay to do an episode 7 today.
11314440	11316440	It was a bit rainy.
11316440	11318440	But she said it was not.
11318440	11320440	It was a lot.
11320440	11324440	A lot of stuff was in French.
11324440	11328440	Which brings me to a good point.
11328440	11330440	So I was afraid to look at it.
11330440	11332440	I don't understand what it meant.
11332440	11334440	Just to take a look at it.
11334440	11336440	I'm a hard guy, right?
11336440	11340440	That's concerning.
11340440	11342440	So that's why I just ran it over.
11342440	11344440	I'll forward it to you.
11344440	11346440	That's what I said to David.
11346440	11348440	I don't know.
11348440	11350440	I would really like to use that against him somehow.
11350440	11352440	I'm trying to do that.
11352440	11354440	It's legal for me to give him that.
11354440	11356440	But he does it with an afterward.
11356440	11358440	I don't know.
11358440	11360440	I don't know what you're talking about.
11360440	11362440	It's hard.
11362440	11364440	It's hard to say.
11364440	11366440	It's hard to say.
11366440	11368440	But it's definitely hard to do what he did.
11372440	11374440	So before the show, what's up with you?
11374440	11376440	You know?
11376440	11378440	You know what's really wrong?
11378440	11380440	You know?
11380440	11382440	I'm just a musician.
11382440	11384440	I used to play football and having...
11384440	11386440	Sorry, I didn't go to it.
11386440	11388440	I see.
11388440	11392440	And there was a guy who lived about me in London.
11392440	11394440	He lived in London for you.
11394440	11396440	He was really good at acting, with the transition.
11396440	11398440	He gave me a list of all that.
11398440	11400440	He addresses me.
11400440	11402440	He'd be a good guy.
11402440	11404440	He'd just have fun and see me.
11404440	11406440	You could tell that or something.
11406440	11408440	And he's the one who said,
11408440	11410440	I don't think it's going to be that bad.
11410440	11412440	And at times it's like $30.
11412440	11414440	I mean, I don't think it's going to be that bad.
11414440	11418440	I want to spend $30 on some bullshit.
11418440	11420440	I would have bought pizza.
11420440	11422440	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
11424440	11426440	Well, that was about the sound of it,
11426440	11428440	but I mean, I was really focused.
11428440	11430440	I have 36 hours to do the single.
11430440	11432440	It's been all my time.
11432440	11434440	A lot of work.
11434440	11436440	A lot of work.
11436440	11438440	You know, I don't do that anymore.
11438440	11440440	Really?
11440440	11442440	Do you miss it?
11442440	11444440	I mean, I miss lifestyle.
11446440	11448440	No.
11448440	11450440	I don't.
11450440	11452440	I don't have music,
11452440	11454440	but I think I do.
11454440	11456440	I don't.
11456440	11458440	Cross our lifestyle.
11458440	11460440	Yeah, but you got to stop at some points.
11460440	11462440	You can't be the other guy doing that.
11462440	11464440	Yeah, there's a lot of things.
11464440	11466440	It's not like it's still going on.
11466440	11468440	Yeah, but still, it's a little creepy.
11468440	11470440	We were at a party.
11470440	11472440	We didn't see what's happening.
11472440	11474440	What's the name of the meeting?
11474440	11476440	I didn't talk to him.
11476440	11478440	I was like, what's the change that you're doing here?
11478440	11480440	You just get out of rehab.
11480440	11482440	That's where he's supposed to not do it.
11482440	11484440	He's like, let's go get a drink.
11484440	11486440	And whatever.
11486440	11488440	It's all like rehab.
11488440	11490440	Things are supposed to not do it.
11490440	11492440	So, you guys,
11492440	11494440	we're having everything.
11494440	11496440	We got the idea.
11498440	11500440	There's a lot of rules.
11500440	11502440	We're not supposed to be that broad.
11502440	11504440	But first you're out.
11504440	11506440	You got laid and be manipulative.
11506440	11508440	Because we don't have your drugs here.
11508440	11510440	You're trying to compensate.
11510440	11512440	I don't know.
11512440	11514440	We'll never realize that.
11514440	11518440	So you're not allowed to date at all after rehab?
11518440	11520440	No.
11520440	11522440	So, you're on a graduation?
11522440	11524440	You'll get that certain tone of the dopey
11524440	11526440	that you don't have for your drug.
11526440	11528440	So, the relationship won't fill it up for you.
11528440	11530440	But you're always going to end tragically
11530440	11532440	because once you're speaking away.
11532440	11534440	It's like what you're going to do.
11534440	11536440	I'm going to act strong.
11536440	11538440	I'm going to act strong.
11538440	11540440	That's what I'm going to do.
11540440	11542440	We'll just talk about that.
11542440	11544440	You don't want to do it?
11544440	11546440	No.
11546440	11548440	It depends.
11548440	11550440	You want to or you want to.
11550440	11552440	If you just don't want to.
11552440	11554440	If you're stuck with it.
11554440	11556440	You have to.
11556440	11558440	I mean, I did.
11558440	11560440	Well, first of all, Muzza,
11560440	11562440	he's called Nick.
11562440	11564440	We need you to stay at this rehab
11564440	11566440	but we figure out everything
11566440	11568440	through your mopsie.
11568440	11570440	If you don't know anything about Muzza
11570440	11572440	or if you don't know anything about Muzza
11572440	11574440	you might want to stay out here.
11574440	11576440	I was banned from the UK for three years.
11576440	11578440	I've never stayed with him.
11578440	11580440	Nothing's relationship.
11580440	11582440	So, stay the year in the California
11582440	11584440	in this rehab.
11584440	11586440	We'll figure out the next move.
11586440	11588440	And that's when I realized
11588440	11590440	that I had to learn really fast
11590440	11592440	for my mother.
11592440	11594440	Well, the Buddha taught me.
11594440	11596440	She got my dad.
11596440	11598440	She threw out my dad.
11598440	11600440	Not the people, literally.
11600440	11602440	But he signed it.
11602440	11604440	But in the New York state
11604440	11606440	he agreed.
11606440	11608440	So, it's not up to her to throw that.
11608440	11610440	So, she landed in the fall of 2004
11610440	11612440	where she gets everything.
11612440	11614440	She's very smart.
11614440	11616440	And I didn't know anything about finance.
11616440	11618440	But she's doing something that's happening
11618440	11620440	where you can learn fast.
11620440	11622440	So, that's why I learned finance.
11624440	11626440	When you're desperate
11626440	11628440	and you have to face off
11628440	11630440	and get nothing to lose
11630440	11632440	you find like you have intelligence
11632440	11634440	and everything.
11634440	11636440	Really, everyone has it.
11636440	11638440	I think it's the current everybody.
11638440	11640440	If you can get rid of the emotion
11640440	11642440	because emotion sort of clogs you up
11642440	11644440	then you can get more free
11644440	11646440	and free of focus.
11646440	11648440	It's emotion that really blocks the emotions.
11648440	11650440	And emotion is important of course
11650440	11652440	but you also need the emotion to
11652440	11654440	connect with someone to understand
11654440	11656440	all the time.
11656440	11658440	You need to control it.
11658440	11660440	It's the greatest freedom.
11662440	11664440	Well, drugs.
11664440	11666440	Drugs help a lot.
11666440	11668440	When they train you, you can do it without drugs.
11668440	11670440	But at first, no, you can't.
11670440	11672440	But you're such an emotional mess.
11672440	11674440	So, you take the drug
11674440	11676440	which calms you down and makes you feel
11676440	11678440	like it's making you focus.
11678440	11680440	Like I was not crying.
11680440	11682440	I was not keeping my father.
11682440	11684440	And it's a reminder that
11684440	11686440	that part exists.
11686440	11688440	It's when you're pressing that existing
11688440	11690440	to get it back.
11690440	11692440	So, you just mind yourself that,
11692440	11694440	yeah, I was free one day.
11694440	11696440	So, you have it.
11696440	11698440	So,
11698440	11700440	you can then exchange it.
11700440	11702440	And you can actually say,
11702440	11704440	wait, is that
11704440	11706440	is that my thinking?
11706440	11708440	Is this you?
11708440	11710440	Is that my question for you?
11710440	11712440	Is this certain?
11712440	11714440	That's the purpose of this.
11714440	11716440	Help me if you can hear me.
11716440	11718440	So, if you can stop me,
11718440	11720440	stop me, stop me.
11720440	11722440	We do it with light speakers.
11722440	11724440	We have it.
11724440	11726440	We get it.
11726440	11728440	It's like it becomes instinctive.
11728440	11730440	My dad would stop me.
11730440	11732440	He's the one.
11732440	11734440	You guys never
11734440	11736440	trust your feelings.
11736440	11738440	Always trust your instincts.
11738440	11740440	Your emotions.
11740440	11742440	And there's a huge difference between
11742440	11744440	your feelings and your emotions
11744440	11746440	and your instincts.
11758440	11760440	What are you talking about?
11760440	11762440	Feelings versus questions.
11762440	11764440	Your instinct, I guess.
11764440	11766440	Your instinct is my emotion.
11766440	11768440	Your instinct is my reply.
11768440	11770440	It's like this danger is not in me.
11770440	11772440	This is going to serve me, not serve me.
11772440	11774440	I'm going to have to calculate it.
11774440	11776440	That's the risk.
11776440	11778440	I'm going to do the risk.
11778440	11780440	Let's see how sad it's going to be.
11780440	11782440	That's a year.
11782440	11784440	Our brains are so fucking
11784440	11786440	amazingly fast.
11786440	11788440	We calculate that.
11788440	11790440	And it comes out as an instinctive
11790440	11792440	instinctive man.
11792440	11794440	The emotion of the cloud,
11794440	11796440	you can see everything through this wall
11796440	11798440	that you're not wanted or not loved
11798440	11800440	or you're not wanted or not loved.
11800440	11802440	That's the way you're going to friend the world.
11802440	11804440	That's the emotion you want to love.
11804440	11806440	So focus on the world.
11806440	11808440	That's all they want.
11808440	11810440	You can do that.
11810440	11812440	Your dad just died.
11812440	11814440	My dad and my mother.
11814440	11816440	It was terrible.
11816440	11818440	I used to be
11818440	11820440	like a...
11820440	11822440	This is a country.
11822440	11824440	I didn't do that.
11824440	11826440	I didn't do shopping.
11826440	11828440	People did it for me.
11828440	11830440	All of a sudden, I'm looking at my car.
11830440	11832440	I don't know how to do it.
11832440	11834440	I don't know how to...
11834440	11836440	I didn't think I had it in me.
11836440	11838440	They did.
11838440	11840440	I don't know. We'll see.
11840440	11842440	We'll see.
11842440	11844440	It's another thing I'm not going to go there.
11846440	11848440	It's a party.
11852440	11854440	Hello.
11854440	11856440	How are you?
11856440	11858440	I'm fine.
11858440	11860440	It's been a few years.
11860440	11862440	Did you sacrifice?
11862440	11864440	No.
11864440	11866440	It's been a few years.
11866440	11868440	Not as good as this guy's.
11868440	11870440	Thanks a lot.
11870440	11872440	What did you do for a while?
11872440	11874440	For a while.
11874440	11876440	For a while?
11876440	11878440	Really?
11878440	11880440	For a while.
11880440	11882440	I was doing a different one.
11882440	11884440	We'll see.
11884440	11886440	We will do the same thing.
11886440	11888440	We will...
11888440	11890440	We'll do some research.
11890440	11892440	Development drugs.
11892440	11894440	Like...
11894440	11896440	We'll see.
11896440	11898440	Yes, yes.
11898440	11900440	I didn't do it.
11900440	11902440	Oh, it didn't happen.
11902440	11904440	Yep. We didn't all...
11904440	11906440	Be born in a...
11906440	11908440	Sorry, we weren't born in a...
11908440	11910440	We didn't all sort out...
11910440	11912440	You would do a different type of drug.
11912440	11914440	You would do a different type of drug.
11914440	11916440	You would do a different type of drug.
11916440	11918440	That's good.
11918440	11920440	That's good.
11920440	11922440	No, no.
11922440	11924440	It's kind of like using drugs.
11924440	11926440	That would be huge investments.
11926440	11928440	They are going to offer you that.
11928440	11930440	No, not anyone would.
11930440	11932440	That's like...
11932440	11934440	There's been a handle.
11934440	11936440	There's been a handle.
11936440	11938440	We have the FBI tries to fire
11938440	11940440	diversely
11940440	11942440	in terms of like backgrounds.
11942440	11944440	So we don't...
11944440	11946440	We try it.
11946440	11948440	There's a big pool of like...
11948440	11950440	I want to join...
11950440	11952440	I want to join...
11952440	11954440	I want to be in contact with...
11954440	11956440	I want to join...
11956440	11958440	The military.
11958440	11960440	We certainly don't want to be a
11960440	11962440	100% of that.
11962440	11964440	We don't want to be a general...
11964440	11966440	We don't want to be a general population.
11966440	11968440	We don't want...
11968440	11970440	We're going to get a fifth grade teacher
11970440	11972440	when I was in high school.
11972440	11974440	He also had a rocket scientist.
11974440	11976440	Just a lot of people.
11976440	11978440	I've had all over the world.
11978440	11980440	What was a fifth grade teacher.
11980440	11982440	They've heard of people together?
11982440	11984440	She's actually a good...
11984440	11986440	She's still a good agent.
11986440	11988440	She must be a people person.
11988440	11990440	She's very good people.
11990440	11992440	But she's also a very good...
11992440	11994720	and a lot of things that we had to do.
11994720	11995720	But...
11995720	11997280	You still have the Casanovas?
11997280	11998480	And it still exists?
11998480	11999480	Casanovas?
11999480	12000480	Is it Mars?
12000480	12001480	What's that?
12001480	12002480	Casanovas.
12002480	12003480	It's Mars.
12003480	12006480	Yeah, well, we don't know a lot like that.
12006480	12007480	It's a little thing.
12007480	12009480	No, it's like the old 60s.
12009480	12012480	You know, the guys who played, you get information.
12012480	12013480	Hello.
12013480	12015480	I don't think that's it.
12015480	12016480	No, I don't.
12016480	12018480	Maybe it's what's waiting for my time.
12018480	12019480	That's the 60s.
12019480	12021480	Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the...
12021520	12023520	You know, that's the limit.
12023520	12025520	They're working for us right now.
12025520	12027520	You guys get fired.
12027520	12029520	That's the same.
12029520	12031520	Do you know how many roles we have?
12031520	12034520	Like, half the stories of your complete bullshit.
12034520	12037520	But, you know, it's good that there's a myth out there
12037520	12040520	that people make you just sleep with whoever.
12040520	12042520	Maybe that's...I'm sure that's what some agents said.
12042520	12043520	It's like, no, no, no.
12043520	12045520	I'm recruiting you for some super secret mission.
12045520	12047520	All you gotta do is sleep with me.
12047520	12048520	Right.
12048560	12050560	You know, she's probably graduating.
12050560	12052560	It's like, I'm working for the FBI.
12052560	12054560	That's what I'm doing.
12054560	12056560	Oh, the good question, though.
12056560	12060560	You guys have unfettered access to, like,
12060560	12065560	the sort of the interagency software
12065560	12068560	where, like, if I wanted to go hack into your phone,
12068560	12072560	I would do it with a new camera.
12072560	12074560	Is there a reason why?
12074560	12076560	Still, there's not a reason why.
12076600	12079600	But there's a powerful cause to be able to use it.
12079600	12083600	Like, if I wanted to hack into your phone
12083600	12087600	and try your camera, would I need a passport?
12087600	12088600	Yeah.
12088600	12091600	Or is it, like, is it sure like now?
12091600	12092600	Is it in the world?
12092600	12094600	See, ten years ago, if you needed a passport,
12094600	12095600	it would be very qualified to get one.
12095600	12098600	But now it's adjacent to the point where you just ask for it.
12098600	12099600	No, it's way harder.
12099600	12100600	Really?
12100600	12101600	Should that, even that?
12101600	12104600	And just thinking theoretically is, like,
12104640	12105640	even harder to do.
12105640	12106640	Really?
12106640	12108640	Yeah, to an effect.
12108640	12111640	You're not, you're no longer searching, you're actively
12111640	12113640	buttering or flipping.
12113640	12115640	That's what happens.
12115640	12118640	Yeah, then that, like, a new turn.
12118640	12120640	Like, a turn on the camera.
12120640	12122640	What's the difference now in a guy sitting in a car
12122640	12124640	on top of a car?
12124640	12127640	Look, this thing can go places for some guy in a car here.
12127640	12128640	Which is...
12128640	12129640	In a car?
12129640	12130640	In a car.
12130640	12131640	In a car in your house.
12131640	12133640	Who's a guy in a car?
12133680	12135680	Yeah, I thought it was you guys.
12135680	12136680	See you guys?
12136680	12138680	We're in the triangle.
12138680	12140680	I don't think so.
12140680	12142680	There's some other interesting things to see.
12142680	12145680	You got a guy outside of the brewery.
12145680	12148680	So he's in the same place with the triangle.
12148680	12151680	And then every time he spots, I mean, it's a wave.
12151680	12153680	I thought it was you.
12153680	12155680	Might be, like, see a higher-department investigator
12155680	12157680	for all I know.
12157680	12158680	Maybe that, too.
12158680	12160680	Let's take a picture of the place.
12160680	12162680	Can I just run it here?
12162720	12163720	How would you run it?
12163720	12165720	Oh, I got some.
12165720	12167720	You got a guy.
12167720	12169720	That's the thing.
12169720	12171720	I got a guy.
12171720	12173720	You used to be seen in the improviser
12173720	12175720	and you guys know how to do it.
12175720	12177720	Oh, I know.
12177720	12179720	That is...
12179720	12181720	How do you put that?
12181720	12182720	Stuff.
12182720	12184720	I mean, you can't do it by yourself.
12184720	12186720	The level of this is not as much as it needs to be
12186720	12189720	to roll with the times and adapt.
12189760	12191760	Like, for example,
12191760	12194760	this whole encryption key battle,
12194760	12198760	like, you know, we've had previous leaders talk about,
12198760	12201760	like, what do you need to give up the encryption key?
12201760	12203760	But we all kind of know, like,
12203760	12205760	philosophically, that'll never,
12205760	12207760	and that shouldn't happen if it doesn't matter.
12207760	12209760	It's, like, a losing battle.
12209760	12211760	We're just going to, unfortunately, have to adapt.
12211760	12214760	If you just build a job, it's just going to be harder.
12214760	12217760	And then many, you know, like,
12217800	12221800	these old-school techniques
12221800	12223800	that, like, talking to people, like,
12223800	12225800	we're talking right now are talking to people
12225800	12227800	that are now way more, you know,
12227800	12229800	just sitting at your desk
12229800	12231800	and looking at, like, a pipeline.
12231800	12234800	So it becomes, there's a question figure
12234800	12236800	at work sometimes.
12236800	12238800	And, like, swaying back tomorrow.
12238800	12241800	And this is just me, but it should be hard.
12241800	12243800	It should be hard?
12243800	12245800	It should be hard.
12245840	12247840	It should be hard.
12247840	12249840	I agree a lot.
12249840	12251840	It should be better.
12251840	12253840	It's not the way it works.
12253840	12255840	It's the way it works.
12255840	12257840	There's nothing, there's no secret to it.
12257840	12259840	It's just that, you know,
12259840	12261840	I can find it when I want it,
12261840	12263840	but I don't really want it yet.
12263840	12265840	There's nothing I can do.
12265840	12267840	You can do that.
12267840	12269840	You know, I mean, I can do it.
12269840	12271840	I can do it anywhere in the world.
12271840	12273840	You know, once you get there,
12273880	12275880	you have to actually keep a secret from all of them.
12275880	12277880	That's a weird quote.
12277880	12279880	I don't know what to make of it.
12279880	12281880	You just have to adapt to it and accept it, I guess.
12281880	12283880	It's true.
12283880	12285880	It's just, like, you know,
12285880	12287880	good pre-LLCs instead of work.
12289880	12291880	You don't have your name on it.
12291880	12293880	That's beautiful things.
12293880	12295880	That's why it's a living dog.
12295880	12297880	You can have a fake name.
12297880	12299880	You can have a name.
12299880	12301880	Perfectly legal.
12301920	12303920	It's a good thing to do.
12303920	12305920	Jersey and all of Iowa.
12305920	12307920	Yeah, it's just like a state.
12307920	12309920	It's a state.
12309920	12311920	You know what?
12311920	12313920	It's very deep, very Jersey.
12313920	12315920	I think that's pretty sure.
12315920	12317920	Probably.
12317920	12319920	It's a good spot.
12323920	12325920	Thank you.
12325920	12327920	You want to go?
12327920	12329920	I'll go.
12329960	12331960	I'm trying to be right there.
12331960	12333960	Yeah.
12335960	12337960	Actually, I think if you prefer
12337960	12339960	an opera or a movie,
12339960	12341960	I think you can take it.
12341960	12343960	I think you can take it.
12343960	12345960	I really do.
12345960	12347960	No, I don't.
12347960	12349960	I think you can take it.
12349960	12351960	You can go to a opera or a movie.
12351960	12353960	You can go to a opera or a movie.
12353960	12355960	You can go to a opera or a movie.
12355960	12357960	You can go to a movie.
12357960	12359960	You know what?
12359960	12361960	You have to do it.
12361960	12363960	You have to do it right.
12363960	12365960	You can go to a opera or a movie.
12365960	12367960	You can do it right.
12367960	12369960	You can go to a opera or a movie.
12369960	12371960	You can do it.
12371960	12373960	You can do it.
12374960	12376960	You know what?
12376960	12378960	You can do it.
12378960	12380960	Okay.
12380960	12382960	I'm not sure.
12382960	12384960	I mean, I can't worry.
12384960	12386960	You can do it.
12386960	12388960	That's the thing I learned.
12388960	12393960	It's not, I can't, it's, it's all I'm learning.
12393960	12395960	It's not only me.
12395960	12397960	It's only freedom, too.
12397960	12399960	It's a freedom, you know what I'm saying?
12399960	12402960	It's worrying about a kid, and then everything is justified.
12402960	12405960	Everything is justified if it's for his safety.
12405960	12407960	You know?
12407960	12410960	That's the interesting part of it.
12410960	12413960	Where are you thinking about yourself all the time?
12413960	12415960	I don't know.
12415960	12418960	I think it's more because of the protector.
12418960	12422960	Yeah, or, uh, or...
12422960	12424960	I don't know.
12424960	12426960	There's a word for it.
12426960	12428960	You're a protector of someone.
12428960	12430960	Someone else's life is now.
12430960	12432960	Yeah.
12432960	12434960	Well, it's also pretty scary as shit.
12434960	12437960	You know, you're accountable for everything.
12438960	12441960	What if it turns out to be an accident?
12441960	12443960	Shit.
12443960	12445960	That's when you were like, that was the other person.
12445960	12447960	Shit.
12449960	12451960	Yeah, you're gonna have faith, though.
12451960	12453960	That's all for me.
12453960	12455960	Here you go.
12460960	12462960	Are you serious?
12462960	12464960	He's just searing in the sun.
12464960	12466960	Well, he's in his heart, right?
12466960	12468960	Yeah.
12472960	12475960	There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
12475960	12477960	What's that?
12477960	12479960	There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
12479960	12481960	And a trade-off and a trade-off.
12481960	12483960	It's really big.
12483960	12485960	The whole concept of oil contracts is really big.
12485960	12487960	Yeah.
12487960	12489960	The oil companies are very political.
12489960	12492960	There's a lot of other factors that you can think of.
12492960	12494960	Yeah?
12494960	12496960	Just political factors?
12496960	12498960	People that are just fucking...
12498960	12500960	I think everyone else is off.
12500960	12502960	Well, I think there's a lot of other things.
12502960	12504960	Peaks down around the whole...
12504960	12506960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
12506960	12508960	I don't know.
12508960	12510960	People have issues with oil contracts.

12722460	12727460	Yeah, I still haven't tried it, you know.
12727460	12731460	I didn't expect you to do this, but you did.
12731460	12736460	You didn't have to decide what you wanted to try.
12736460	12737460	You just didn't know.
12737460	12744460	You didn't even know how to do it.
12744460	12745460	You just flashed in there.
12745460	12747460	You could be just pumping down.
12747460	12748460	Yeah.
12748460	12753460	I didn't want to say too much.
12753460	12757460	The whole Brickel-Prinsky arena.

12825460	12826460	I'm the last one on my list.
12826460	12827460	I got the person.
12827460	12830460	So it's just been decided that there's noney for now.
12830460	12832460	How did you figure that out?
12832460	12836460	I just put the time last time I logged in.
12836460	12838460	I didn't log in. I wasn't going to log in.
12838460	12840460	What the fuck? I didn't log in the moment.
12840460	12842460	And what would they go for?
12842460	12844460	And then I took the last window.
12844460	12846460	They didn't even open.
12846460	12848460	I think I just sort of assumed it was a log file
12848460	12850460	because the windows were open.
12850460	12852460	But I actually don't really know what they thought.
12852460	12854460	I still think it could be gone.
12854460	12856460	When the gun thought I was by.
12856460	12862460	Glenn was a funny story.
12862460	12864460	So after the Bahamas,
12864460	12866460	he slides me back to his house.
12866460	12868460	At first I thought I was staying at a hotel.
12868460	12870460	He said, go to his house.
12870460	12872460	And it turns out I was at his house.
12872460	12874460	Why am I staying here?
12874460	12876460	It's too hot right now in Florida.
12876460	12878460	And it's too hot in DC.
12878460	12880460	You can't put your hotel in.
12880460	12882460	You've got to stay here.
12882460	12884460	Fortunately, my wife is gone on a vacation.
12884460	12886460	But you can stay in her room.
12886460	12888460	Her room.
12888460	12890460	They haven't slept in the same rooms
12890460	12892460	for like ten years.
12892460	12894460	So they're separated by the same house.
12894460	12896460	Okay, so I stayed in his room.
12896460	12898460	I was asleep.
12898460	12900460	I was so tired and I had some long flight.
12900460	12902460	And then I wake up.
12902460	12904460	And you know,
12904460	12906460	God save your cigarette.
12906460	12908460	He has this colonial house with this kitchen porch.
12908460	12910460	And I notice there's like a brick
12910460	12912460	in the screen window.
12912460	12914460	Yeah.
12914460	12916460	I sat there the last night.
12916460	12918460	I didn't call it a good story.
12918460	12920460	What were you doing at 2am last night?
12920460	12922460	I was asleep.
12922460	12924460	In bed.
12924460	12926460	No, you weren't.
12926460	12928460	I heard a car.
12928460	12930460	I saw you run to the car.
12930460	12932460	They gave him something.
12932460	12934460	What did you give him?
12934460	12936460	I didn't give him anything.
12936460	12938460	I have it all in video.
12938460	12940460	And it is this huge 1997 camera
12940460	12942460	that you know,
12942460	12944460	he has not updated its RAM systems.
12944460	12946460	Made by Nintendo.
12946460	12948460	Nintendo, yeah.
12948460	12950460	And so he starts going through his,
12950460	12952460	you know, his fast-forward
12952460	12954460	thing in his office.
12954460	12956460	He takes me to the office.
12956460	12958460	He's like, he's so
12958460	12960460	convinced that he's caught a Russian spy
12960460	12962460	in his house trying to get out of there.
12962460	12964460	Dossier just was published.
12964460	12966460	He's like,
12966460	12968460	he's out.
12968460	12970460	And then,
12970460	12972460	around 2am,
12972460	12974460	we see a hundred shadowy figure
12974460	12976460	approach.
12976460	12978460	Wow.
12978460	12980460	And I see it.
12980460	12982460	And I see the figures sort of stumble and fall.
12982460	12984460	And they stand up really quick.
12984460	12986460	And I look around and see the camera.
12986460	12988460	Glad he's a nice little kid.
12988460	12990460	He's strong, he's strong.
12990460	12992460	And you can't get into.
12992460	12994460	He's trying to slice the window screen.
12994460	12996460	The only window that doesn't have an alarm
12996460	12998460	is the camera.
12998460	13000460	No, no, Glenn Simpson.
13000460	13002460	He's going to be a Russian spy
13002460	13004460	when his son tries to sneak back in
13004460	13006460	for a party.
13006460	13008460	Still no apology.
13008460	13010460	You guys.
13012460	13014460	I appreciate that.
13014460	13016460	Well, anything else
13016460	13018460	that you think you might be able to help out with
13018460	13020460	is what I'm going to do is I've written down
13020460	13022460	a list of the stuff that
13022460	13024460	you see in Access To.
13024460	13026460	And I'm going to be able to do
13026460	13028460	some of the project stuff
13028460	13030460	that would be useful for someone.
13030460	13032460	I don't know.
13032460	13034460	I can do
13034460	13036460	emails.
13036460	13038460	Those are pretty easy.
13038460	13040460	Again, social engineering
13040460	13042460	I'm pretty good at.
13042460	13044460	When I get in that zone
13044460	13046460	and turn on the charm,
13046460	13048460	I can do fun,
13048460	13050460	actually enjoy it sometimes.
13050460	13052460	Actually, that would be fun.
13052460	13054460	If you need...
13054460	13056460	I've been focusing
13056460	13058460	just as like any concerned citizen,
13058460	13060460	but you guys have to be honest
13060460	13062460	so you don't have to answer the question.
13062460	13064460	I'm sort of Trump-based.
13064460	13066460	People come to me
13066460	13068460	with a lot of financial documents
13068460	13070460	from all over the world.
13070460	13072460	A lot of them are just...
13072460	13074460	There's a lot of hoops.
13074460	13076460	Some people like Ed from Ireland
13076460	13078460	is a legit guy.
13078460	13080460	The Catrice Jose guy
13080460	13082460	is some sort of state-run guy.
13082460	13084460	I don't know.
13084460	13086460	But I get a lot of that.
13086460	13088460	And then
13088460	13090460	there's
13090460	13092460	the Epstein thing with the sort of
13092460	13094460	a side gig for New York Times.
13094460	13096460	But I can
13096460	13098460	get that data,
13098460	13100460	but I did not want to take the step
13100460	13102460	to break in.
13102460	13104460	If you need me to do that, I'm happy to break in.
13104460	13106460	And if it's legal, and you guys are like
13106460	13108460	do legally, let's say
13108460	13110460	you can do this, I'll make that.
13110460	13112460	Good.
13112460	13114460	And it would definitely be something
13114460	13116460	we would tell you to do with a bunch of other caveats
13116460	13118460	and would not be allowed to do.
13118460	13120460	But...
13120460	13122460	Let's see.
13122460	13124460	Let me know if I missed anything too,
13124460	13126460	because I have
13126460	13128460	Tyler Rossi about MPS.
13128460	13130460	He did a man-in-the-mill for
13130460	13132460	eating from mom's computer.
13132460	13134460	You hacked the rich bank, but not really.
13134460	13136460	Right.
13136460	13138460	I still can, though.
13138460	13140460	I don't know if I'm
13140460	13142460	studying or I don't know.
13142460	13144460	If you ask me, you should not do any illegal activity.
13144460	13146460	That's probably the best
13146460	13148460	most of action.
13148460	13150460	No, I'm not going to know that for sure.
13150460	13152460	I'm not going to talk about that.
13152460	13154460	But hacking a bank
13154460	13156460	is just hacking the bankers.
13156460	13158460	That's true. That's illegal.
13158460	13160460	I wouldn't suggest it.
13160460	13162460	No, but I mean, in a case,
13162460	13164460	it would be something that you would want.
13164460	13166460	But can you really hack people like that?
13166460	13168460	It's not something
13168460	13170460	that we would normally do.
13170460	13172460	So, like,
13172460	13174460	it's good to know you have the skills, because we could
13174460	13176460	put you in a situation where you can talk to other people,
13176460	13178460	or we can introduce you to a group,
13178460	13180460	or do something else, and you're more complicated.
13180460	13182460	But knowing your skills is a good thing to do.
13182460	13184460	But it would be rare where I'd be like,
13184460	13186460	hey, go hacking a Deutsche Bank,
13186460	13188460	deal with this stuff for me,
13188460	13190460	because in court, that would be a hell of a thing
13190460	13192460	to show that the
13192460	13194460	government essentially hacked into a bank to deal with that.
13194460	13196460	Well, I know, but there's also
13196460	13198460	you guys, I'm sure you have people like this
13198460	13200460	in your agency, where other
13200460	13202460	agencies have the same types, where you find
13202460	13204460	an outside person like myself,
13204460	13206460	that you hire basically
13206460	13208460	to break the rules, but you don't say to break the rules.
13208460	13210460	You need someone that, you don't do that?
13210460	13212460	No. No?
13212460	13214460	Definitely. Okay.
13214460	13216460	I would tell you this, the rule is
13216460	13218460	if you were officially working with us,
13218460	13220460	you are an extension of the government
13220460	13222460	in the sense that if
13222460	13224460	you can't do anything I can't do.
13224460	13226460	Like a self-contractor.
13226460	13228460	Yeah, I guess you can kind of think about it like that.
13228460	13230460	You're not employed by the government.
13230460	13232460	But like, if I told you to
13232460	13234460	hack into something, it'd be like me hacking into it.
13234460	13236460	I can't do it, you can't do it.
13236460	13238460	Okay, so I'd represent,
13238460	13240460	who would you represent in the government?
13240460	13241460	Like, or...
13241460	13242460	Indirectly, yeah.
13242460	13244460	Like, you would give a...
13244460	13246460	You would be getting the direction from the government, too, which I mean.
13246460	13248460	It's like, there's a floor
13248460	13249460	or something.
13249460	13251460	The action is filled with government.
13251460	13252460	Right, right.
13252460	13254460	But technically, it's not, you're not,
13254460	13255460	it's not the government.
13255460	13257460	And who pays you is not the government either.
13257460	13259460	If you're an independent, who,
13259460	13260460	how do you pay it?
13260460	13262460	You mean, if you were to
13262460	13263460	be helping or something?
13263460	13264460	Sure.
13264460	13266460	Yeah, that's the government.
13266460	13268460	Which actually comes from the government?
13268460	13270460	No, it would be taxing.
13270460	13271460	Oh, okay.
13271460	13272460	Yeah.
13272460	13275460	But, we don't hire people to break the law.
13275460	13277460	Like, to search ventricles.
13277460	13278460	Are there any...
13278460	13279460	I'm sure they do.
13279460	13281460	But that's Oklahoma's stuff.
13281460	13283460	So, like, oversees the rules are different, right?
13283460	13285460	Like, oversees your
13285460	13287460	committing espionage, which is by the fact,
13287460	13289460	you know, the fact that we're against the law, right?
13289460	13290460	Right.
13290460	13291460	And the United States, you know,
13291460	13293460	we're still bound by the Constitution.
13293460	13295460	So, like, one distinction I want to make, too,
13295460	13297460	is like, with the FBI, like,
13297460	13299460	we will follow the rules every time.
13299460	13301460	I'm never going to tell you to break the rule,
13301460	13303460	and like, don't tell me about it or something.
13303460	13304460	We'll never deal with that situation.
13304460	13305460	Make a win-win.
13305460	13306460	Never.
13306460	13308460	If I tell you something, like,
13308460	13310460	even if I ask you to talk about something
13310460	13312460	that could be considered as illegal,
13312460	13314460	I'll have a whole document of, like,
13314460	13316460	this is exactly what you're allowed to say,
13316460	13317460	this is what you're not allowed to say,
13317460	13319460	these are the communities,
13319460	13321460	and you can't deviate from these four corners.
13321460	13323460	Otherwise, we distance ourselves from you,
13323460	13325460	because it's not what we ask.
13325460	13326460	Okay.
13326460	13329460	So, because there's a lot of stuff about what the FBI is,
13329460	13330460	or is it?
13330460	13332460	Like, just from talking to you today, right?
13332460	13334460	There's a lot of stuff that
13334460	13335460	you've perceived to be as Jewish.
13335460	13336460	Oh, yeah.
13336460	13337460	I totally learned a lot today.
13337460	13338460	Yeah.
13338460	13340460	So, that being said, it's like,
13340460	13341460	if you work with us,
13341460	13343460	it has to be very clear
13343460	13345460	that you're not breaking any rules.
13345460	13346460	Right?
13346460	13348460	Because we also don't want to work with people
13348460	13350460	who are not going to be able to follow directions.
13350460	13352460	We talked about it, it makes sense to me,
13352460	13354460	but, like, if you're going to give us information, too,
13354460	13356460	we have to know that that is the whole fiction.
13356460	13358460	You can't, like, take part of it.
13358460	13360460	You can't omit the stuff
13360460	13362460	that you don't want to tell us,
13362460	13363460	and it also has to be everything.
13363460	13365460	Because if we find out that it isn't everything,
13365460	13366460	then we can't trust you, right?
13366460	13367460	Right, right.
13367460	13368460	So, you want me to hold back?
13368460	13369460	I'm like, Barrett.
13369460	13372460	If you ask me, tell me about Barrett.
13372460	13373460	So, that would be,
13373460	13376460	that would have to be what we have now.
13376460	13378460	So, we're not,
13378460	13382460	are we really bound to tell you everything I know?
13382460	13383460	Not really bound.
13383460	13384460	Here's the thing.
13384460	13386460	Can I make a mission based on what I think
13386460	13388460	is irrelevant and irrelevant?
13388460	13389460	Or no?
13389460	13391460	It depends, right?
13391460	13392460	I mean, like, here's the thing.
13392460	13394460	You're not going to be your only source of information.
13394460	13396460	That's not how to work either, right?
13396460	13398460	I'm going to verify what you say.
13398460	13399460	It's like I look at this stuff
13399460	13400460	and I'll try to figure out it.
13400460	13401460	It's like a report.
13401460	13402460	Yeah, it's like a report, right?
13402460	13404460	I mean, they're also investigators, so to speak.
13404460	13406460	They publish their stuff.
13406460	13409460	But, if you were to work with us, right?
13409460	13412460	What I need from you most is trust.
13412460	13414460	If I can't trust what you're saying,
13414460	13416460	if I can't trust you with the information I give you,
13416460	13418460	then there's absolutely no reason we would work together.
13418460	13419460	Right?
13419460	13421460	If we were to involve you in something
13421460	13423460	where you are involved with other criminals,
13423460	13426460	you say, hey, by the way, I'm working with the FBI,
13426460	13428460	that whole thing goes to put them.
13428460	13429460	Right?
13429460	13430460	I mean, it doesn't help us.
13430460	13433460	So that's why you allow this stuff, too.
13433460	13435460	If you're here to give us information,
13435460	13438460	it was partial information and it was admitted, right?
13438460	13441460	There's a part in the court called Discovery, right?
13441460	13442460	I'm not sure how it works.
13442460	13445460	So with Discovery, we have to provide everything to defend.
13445460	13447460	That's how every U.S. government works, right?
13447460	13450460	Everything that we have that we're using to prosecute this guy,
13450460	13451460	the defense gets a copy of it.
13451460	13453460	So they can prosecute any of your stuff, right?
13453460	13454460	Right.
13454460	13456460	It's getting illegal happening and they...
13456460	13460460	So in the case that if you gave us partial information,
13460460	13462460	we'd provide that to the defense.
13462460	13463460	The defense obviously knows the full story
13463460	13465460	because that's the one he's being charged.
13465460	13467460	They say, actually, I said a bunch of stuff
13467460	13468460	that is exculpatory.
13468460	13470460	In other words, stuff that shows that I was innocent,
13470460	13472460	but it was selectively filtered out.
13472460	13474460	Our whole case would go to shit.
13474460	13476460	That's a regular job of having this guy.
13476460	13477460	Exactly, right.
13477460	13480460	So just how it's not fair for Prasada to do that to you, right?
13480460	13481460	Right.
13481460	13485460	So as the U.S. government, because we are the U.S. government,
13485460	13488460	we play exactly by the rules, every time.
13488460	13490460	So is there a guy, a middle manager there, at some point,
13490460	13494460	that says, I decide what goes into this reporting
13494460	13495460	and what does not go into the court?
13495460	13496460	So it's not my decision.
13496460	13499460	I just give you all the data you ask for, right?
13499460	13502460	Without any omission, and someone else makes that decision.
13502460	13503460	Okay.
13503460	13506460	Yeah, it's usually the case agent who would be working with you
13506460	13509460	who would say, okay, hey, I'm going to write this report.
13509460	13512460	And we write it in a way that doesn't disclose everything, right?
13512460	13514460	Because if I write your name in my report...
13514460	13516460	Can I text your identity, but it's still...
13516460	13518460	It doesn't hide anything.
13518460	13523460	We'll often put you guys in position to make you look bad,
13523460	13525460	but, you know, try to get it.
13525460	13526460	Try to get it.
13526460	13527460	So anyway...
13527460	13529460	Cover your ass and get it.
13529460	13530460	Right.
13530460	13532460	That's just the general way we work with people
13532460	13534460	because we work with a lot of different people
13534460	13535460	in a lot of different areas of life.
13535460	13538460	Like, I work drugs and drug dealers on my account,
13538460	13540460	and, you know, we work with them.
13540460	13541460	Do we drug you there?
13541460	13542460	Mm-hmm.
13542460	13543460	Yeah.
13543460	13544460	Because we've got to work our way into the chain.
13544460	13545460	How else do you think...
13545460	13546460	You can't just get the runners all day, right?
13546460	13547460	Right.
13547460	13549460	You get in the tenants and you get the people at the top
13549460	13550460	and try to...
13550460	13551460	Back down.
13551460	13552460	I don't care.
13552460	13553460	It just fucking has to happen.
13553460	13554460	It's completely...
13554460	13555460	It's completely...
13555460	13557460	Kind of like what we said downstairs.
13557460	13559460	It's hard, right?
13559460	13561460	It's hard to do this job,
13561460	13562460	but it should be hard.
13562460	13563460	Because of the rules?
13563460	13564460	Yeah.
13564460	13565460	I mean, the rules are hard.
13565460	13568460	Because that thing would be easy for us to do.
13568460	13570460	But we're with the new rules.
13570460	13572460	That's why we're going to do it with the new rules.
13572460	13574460	Because it's the right thing to do.
13574460	13576460	Is it like a chain of evidence or a thing?
13576460	13577460	Like, there's like a cartel.
13577460	13579460	You think, you know, there's a guy's IP address.
13579460	13581460	You know, there's email.
13581460	13584460	So now that, like, drug dealers are using,
13584460	13587460	like, the encrypted chat,
13587460	13589460	it doesn't work to go to the telephone company
13589460	13593460	and say, hey, we want to get a title-free on this cell phone
13593460	13595460	so we can see all the types of things.
13595460	13597460	That's all then in the water.
13597460	13600460	And now in order to get their communication,
13600460	13603460	like, you'd have to actually get a hold of the phone
13603460	13604460	and put...
13604460	13606460	And honestly, the way to do it is, like,
13606460	13608460	you'd have to get someone inside the group.
13608460	13610460	Yeah, close on.
13610460	13612460	Yeah, even then, like, you need someone to, like,
13612460	13614460	20 or 70 men in that phone.
13614460	13615460	Can it be an 8?
13615460	13616460	Yeah, I got it.
13616460	13618460	It still goes back to, like, that thing
13618460	13620460	where you have to get someone inside.
13620460	13622460	We can't just sit back and rely.
13622460	13624460	Yeah, because it's not...
13624460	13628460	It's because it's illegal to hack into the phone
13628460	13632460	and to bring it back in Christian.
13632460	13635460	So even with a proper warrant, you cannot...
13635460	13638460	Oh, yeah, exactly. With a proper warrant, you can't
13638460	13641460	because the technology is testing against that now.
13641460	13643460	It's not the technology itself.
13643460	13646460	But if someone can still do it, it's still doable, right?
13646460	13650460	Like, if someone was using some app that the data was still
13650460	13652460	housed with the service provider,
13652460	13654460	then, yeah, yeah, it would do it.
13654460	13656460	Because it's legally within the phone
13656460	13659460	and that company legally has the content.
13659460	13661460	Is it too much for me to ask, like,
13661460	13663460	what is legally outside the phone?
13663460	13666460	Well, you can even ask about that.
13666460	13669460	And it's just an hacking situation.
13669460	13672460	Like, if you know a cartel guy and you have a warrant,
13672460	13675460	what can you legally not do?
13675460	13678460	Yeah, I think maybe it's easier.
13678460	13680460	I'm just curious.
13680460	13684460	You can't break any law in order to get access to that guy.
13684460	13686460	Still the right?
13686460	13688460	No, we can't do that happen.
13688460	13689460	You can't?
13689460	13691460	Yeah, no, we can't.
13691460	13693460	Yeah, throughout the hacking or anything.
13693460	13695460	And giving a court order or a search warrant
13695460	13698460	to an ISP or a telecom provider is not hacking.
13698460	13701460	There's a law that says we can do that.
13701460	13703460	The warrant is what permits us to get things
13703460	13705460	that are under reasonable expectation of privacy,
13705460	13707460	which is what you're hacking.
13707460	13710460	You're hacking because it's not publicly available.
13710460	13712460	So if you have to breach that expectation of privacy,
13712460	13715460	we need a warrant as a government to get that.
13715460	13717460	The warrant will specify what you can and can't do.
13717460	13720460	And you can break expectation of privacy.
13720460	13723460	And if this is all to protect against, you know,
13723460	13726460	all the crazy shit that goes on and abuses and things like that.
13726460	13728460	So, like, I mean, as much as the government
13728460	13730460	does kind of a fuck up shit show,
13730460	13733460	I mean, it is put up in a way to protect people,
13733460	13734460	protect American people.
13734460	13736460	Their privacy, their liberty, things like that.
13736460	13737460	So when people think like,
13737460	13738460	like my mom does the same thing,
13738460	13740460	she's like, well, are you reading my e-mail that I love?
13740460	13741460	I don't have time to read your e-mail.
13741460	13742460	One.
13742460	13744460	And two, like, why would I be reading your e-mail?
13744460	13745460	That doesn't make any sense.
13745460	13746460	Trust me, I did it.
13746460	13747460	You don't want to read your mom's e-mail.
13747460	13751460	You don't want to do that.
13751460	13753460	Can't go backwards.
13753460	13754460	You can't.
13754460	13755460	I'm going to do that.
13755460	13756460	You can't ever go backwards.
13756460	13757460	Yeah, so there's...
13757460	13758460	I get it.
13758460	13760460	Yeah, there's limitations that we work under, but...
13760460	13761460	I like that.
13761460	13762460	It's fine.
13762460	13766460	It's like, you know, everyone has to have a...
13766460	13768460	Yeah, we play about the rules.
13768460	13770460	But when we do win, right,
13770460	13772460	when we do arrest someone or something like that,
13772460	13774460	our cases are, you know, airtight, right?
13774460	13776460	We've covered every angle that we can.
13776460	13777460	We've got all the information,
13777460	13779460	and we've vetted everything to make sure that,
13779460	13780460	we have the right person, right?
13780460	13782460	We want to make sure we have the right person,
13782460	13784460	and we have everything that leads up to it.
13784460	13786460	So, anyway, that's all just background
13786460	13788460	on how we work and how we work with sources
13788460	13789460	and stuff like that.
13789460	13790460	That's good.
13790460	13792460	I like to do extremely different things.
13792460	13794460	Karen, it's really like Tim and Jami.
13794460	13796460	Tim and Jami are very different.
13796460	13798460	Yeah, because I think that's the other thing, too,
13798460	13800460	is if we break the rules to get to our end of goal,
13800460	13802460	how are we getting better than the bad guys?
13802460	13803460	Right.
13803460	13804460	Right, and just fighting.
13804460	13805460	Yeah, it's easy.
13805460	13807460	I mean, it'd be easy for me to hack into a bunch of stuff,
13807460	13809460	but then I'm just a hacker.
13809460	13812460	I'm just a criminal doing rogue stuff.
13812460	13814460	Oh, vigilante.
13814460	13816460	True, but vigilante is just not far.
13816460	13819460	Anyway, that goes a whole different term.
13819460	13821460	Let's say that for a team of group.
13821460	13822460	Okay.
13824460	13825460	So, what else do I have?
13825460	13827460	Okay, we talked about Irish bank fraud.
13827460	13831460	OCCP, you're an admin on Hunter.d.gov.
13831460	13832460	Both.
13832460	13833460	Both.
13833460	13834460	Both.
13834460	13835460	Both.
13835460	13837460	The use of OCCP.
13837460	13838460	OCCRP, yeah.
13838460	13839460	OCCRP is down?
13839460	13840460	No, it's up.
13840460	13841460	Okay, yeah.
13841460	13842460	So, you're an admin on goal?
13842460	13843460	Yeah.
13843460	13845460	Well, I have an accent.
13845460	13846460	Okay.
13846460	13847460	And...
13847460	13849460	I know how to understand the documents, too,
13849460	13850460	which is...
13850460	13853460	I've learned a lot from the government.
13853460	13856460	So, if you need to...
13856460	13858460	If you want to know what a CLO is,
13858460	13860460	why it's important that it happens in 2008
13860460	13864460	in Ireland versus the UK,
13864460	13866460	I can help you understand that.
13866460	13867460	Okay.
13868460	13869460	We'll see.
13869460	13870460	You have...
13870460	13872460	David Eichrich has...
13872460	13876460	Well, I guess he tasks you to get into Epstein D-Mail
13876460	13879460	and his Epstein Y-C-Mail.
13879460	13881460	You know what he's password-wise?
13881460	13883460	It's up line.
13883460	13884460	It's a G-21.
13884460	13885460	A little...
13885460	13886460	I hit it.
13886460	13888460	A little same job.
13888460	13889460	A little...
13889460	13890460	Little...
13890460	13891460	A little same job.
13891460	13892460	A little same job.
13892460	13893460	A little same job.
13893460	13894460	A little same job.
13894460	13895460	A little same job.
13895460	13896460	A little same job.
13896460	13897460	A little same job.
13897460	13898460	A little same job.
13898460	13899460	A little same job.
13899460	13901460	You can just look at the old hacks from...
13901460	13902460	Oh, right.
13902460	13903460	Yeah, pretty easy.
13903460	13905460	But don't tell anybody.
13905460	13909460	You're also in a single group with Barrett,
13909460	13914460	Emma, Van, your friend,
13914460	13916460	and like a hundred other people there.
13916460	13917460	And a lot of journalists.
13917460	13918460	Journalists.
13918460	13919460	Journalists.
13919460	13920460	Journalists.
13920460	13921460	Okay.
13921460	13922460	You're capable of doing some email hacks
13922460	13926460	and then you'll do some light forensics.
13926460	13928460	I guess with this single group...
13928460	13929460	There's a big difference.
13929460	13930460	Okay.
13930460	13931460	Not like that.
13931460	13932460	That's...
13932460	13933460	I've been practicing a lot with that.
13933460	13936460	That's like my latest interest.
13936460	13937460	But mostly...
13937460	13938460	But with the software.
13938460	13940460	It happened, you know, not on my own.
13940460	13942460	I'm not coding it or writing it.
13942460	13944460	I don't think many people are coding it
13944460	13945460	or writing it themselves.
13945460	13946460	No, I'm very good.
13946460	13948460	I think it's a little bit better than...
13948460	13950460	But yeah, with Magnet, it was open source.
13950460	13952460	But with Magnet, of course, it's better.
13952460	13953460	Yeah, it's not like that.
13953460	13954460	I can prove that to you.
13954460	13957460	You need to do a demonstration of that.
13957460	13958460	Okay.
13958460	13961460	In a single group, you said Barrett...
13961460	13963460	Barrett said that he's not getting anything legal.
13963460	13964460	Is that right?
13964460	13965460	Or not getting anything stupid?
13965460	13966460	No.
13966460	13968460	He's always saying something stupid.
13968460	13970460	But he's just, you know, he's such a rabble.
13970460	13973460	Let's see what happens after he calms down a bit.
13973460	13975460	Because he was high a lot.
13975460	13976460	Okay.
13976460	13977460	He was very high.
13977460	13979460	And he was not happy.
13979460	13981460	So it was more worried about him.
13981460	13983460	No one really took it seriously.
13983460	13986460	You said the rest of the stuff in that group is mainly...
13986460	13988460	People miscontented about stuff.
13988460	13989460	Yeah.
13989460	13991460	You said these steps are basically just bitching a lot.
13991460	13992460	But like...
13992460	13994460	A lot of, like, fuck movies meant, you know...
13994460	13997460	And like, well, actually, I couldn't want to fuck movies meant.
13997460	13999460	You know, like, well, why would you want to do that?
13999460	14001460	You know, it's like that stuff.
14001460	14003460	You know, look at this Twitter post.
14003460	14006460	Or this cop just beat up this woman on the street.
14006460	14008460	You know, there's a lot of that, too.
14008460	14009460	Okay.
14009460	14010460	With the riots and stuff.
14010460	14011460	Sure.
14011460	14015460	But if you're asking if there's, like, organization or people are getting together and, you know...
14016460	14018460	I think they're very watched.
14018460	14020460	You know, there's no organization.
14020460	14021460	It's like, it's just chaos.
14021460	14022460	It's fun to see what happens.
14022460	14024460	It's like, Mike, I'm out of it, yeah.
14024460	14026460	And I meet some interesting people.
14026460	14028460	There's nothing, nothing explicitly illegal.
14028460	14033460	They don't talk about, you know, collectivity or hacking stuff or anything like that.
14033460	14034460	Why?
14034460	14035460	Well, yeah, of course.
14035460	14037460	No, there is a talk about that, yeah.
14037460	14039460	But it's like a friend of mine says,
14039460	14048460	Oh, do you know how I get ISPs from Prague, you know, circa 2016?
14048460	14050460	Clearly, you're trying to find a common shit, right?
14050460	14052460	You know, everyone's a loving the baby.
14052460	14054460	You know, stuff like that, you know.
14054460	14056460	And if you have it, you have nowhere to get it.
14056460	14058460	I think the city's sure to hear you though.
14058460	14059460	There's a link.
14059460	14060460	Do you know what Irish bankers are?
14060460	14063460	The other day, I mean, an Irish banker that knows how to do,
14063460	14065460	you know, anybody in Ireland right now.
14065460	14067460	I'm here to get some coin telegraph.
14067460	14069460	Yeah, stuff like that.
14069460	14075460	But like, I'm the only idiot that says, Hey, Emma,
14075460	14078460	can you give me a favor and help me hack David Emmerich?
14078460	14080460	Because I got to get into his fucking email.
14080460	14082460	I'm the only idiot that says that.
14082460	14084460	So, yeah.
14084460	14085460	Okay.
14085460	14088460	So no one else crossed about like who's behind pass or who's behind it?
14088460	14089460	Oh, yeah.
14089460	14090460	I know.
14090460	14091460	Yeah.
14091460	14093460	There's a really good big discussion on who's behind Lowe's.
14093460	14095460	Oh, Lowe's, I think.
14095460	14100460	Or, well, no, the abbreviated version of Lowe's.
14100460	14101460	Okay.
14101460	14103460	It's like a, whoever did the came out.
14103460	14104460	Oh, yeah.
14104460	14106460	Who did they think the came out of?
14106460	14109460	I think they, I mean, what are some of the opinions of?
14109460	14112460	All I know is my opinion right now, as I can remember,
14112460	14114460	and I'm not holding back or meaning information,
14114460	14116460	because I just can't remember.
14116460	14118460	But if you give me time to look, I'll find it for you.
14118460	14121460	My opinion is, I think it's Emma.
14121460	14124460	The Spanish, the Spanish is broken.
14124460	14127460	Again, Maria speaks eight languages for sure.
14127460	14129460	I mean, it's not the first.
14129460	14130460	It's not a native speaker.
14130460	14131460	It's not a native speaker.
14131460	14136460	And the angry, the anger sort of matches Emma's anger.
14136460	14139460	And the thought process that makes, gets you to write a certain sentence,
14139460	14141460	matches Harry's thought process.
14141460	14142460	The way I educated it anyway.
14142460	14144460	You know, you have to, in order to say the certain sentence,
14144460	14146460	you have to think and feel the sort of thing.
14146460	14148460	We're in the, we're in this frame group.
14148460	14150460	And I see that pattern matched with it.
14150460	14154460	So what Spanish document was it that matched?
14154460	14155460	The manifesto.
14155460	14156460	Oh, the manifesto.
14156460	14157460	No.
14157460	14158460	Okay.
14158460	14159460	Interesting.
14159460	14160460	So aside from like the speech pattern,
14160460	14162460	is there anything else, any other reason why you think
14162460	14164460	the best is behind the game of the island?
14164460	14167460	Well, the thought process, obviously.
14167460	14168460	Yeah.
14168460	14169460	The motivation, I guess, right?
14169460	14170460	It's really angry.
14170460	14171460	Well, no, no more.
14171460	14174460	The motivation, well, you must know.
14174460	14176460	I mean, if you're angry, you know,
14176460	14179460	the motivation is just, you can do it.
14179460	14181460	You know, sometimes, yeah, you're broke, you need some money.
14181460	14184460	Or if you want to, you know, see, I'm better than you or not.
14184460	14186460	But it's like, here's a challenge.
14186460	14188460	You know, that's most of the motivation.
14188460	14190460	You should know that though, right?
14190460	14191460	But it's different, too.
14191460	14192460	Oh, you mean political motivation.
14192460	14193460	There's different motivations, too,
14193460	14194460	with different hackers, too, right?
14194460	14196460	Some hackers are just curious.
14196460	14198460	Like, they just want to see if they can break the system.
14198460	14200460	But they're the ones who hack for a purpose, right?
14200460	14202460	Like, a lot of the hack-tivists out there,
14202460	14203460	you know, they'll hack because...
14203460	14204460	We'll leak something.
14204460	14205460	What about...
14205460	14207460	We're talking about we'll leak, aren't we?
14207460	14208460	What about we'll leak?
14208460	14210460	That's what you're asking about.
14210460	14212460	Well, there's a bunch of different types of things.
14212460	14213460	I don't know.
14213460	14218460	So, the boot leaks appeared on...
14218460	14221460	Honestly, I don't know why he was going after it.
14221460	14223460	I don't think he did it.
14223460	14225460	At first, I think it became the one.
14225460	14226460	I don't think he did boot leaks.
14226460	14228460	Boot leaks was...
14228460	14231460	But you know, and I'm sure you know,
14231460	14235460	and I'm sure you know that your computer systems are outdated.
14235460	14236460	Right?
14236460	14237460	Okay?
14237460	14239460	You're fucking really outdated, right?
14239460	14242460	And the FBI's computer systems are outdated.
14242460	14245460	What do you think the local sheriff's fucking office in Minnesota
14245460	14248460	is still running, like, Windows NT, right?
14248460	14251460	So, it's not difficult, you know?
14251460	14254460	And I think it's consortium.
14254460	14257460	My personal opinion, based on no evidence at all,
14257460	14262460	is that consortium hackers just have to talk about the...
14262460	14264460	the Black Lives Matter, I think, to talk about the police
14264460	14266460	and here's the revenge.
14266460	14269460	I don't think it was, you know,
14269460	14271460	politically motivated by...
14271460	14276460	motivated by some, like, left-wing George Soros fucking thing.
14276460	14278460	You know, conspiracy theory, right?
14278460	14280460	Just angry kids, you know?
14280460	14281460	That's it.
14281460	14282460	That's right.
14282460	14283460	But I could be wrong.
14283460	14285460	I'm off the wrong side.
14285460	14287460	So, you don't think you have a vested behind that
14287460	14289460	that she's behind King Island and what else?
14289460	14291460	I personally, I think, came here.
14291460	14295460	Because just her reaction to my asking for the 100,000
14295460	14298460	in Bitcoin, Deutsche Bank, was sort of took me off.
14298460	14301460	You don't react like that if you just move.
14301460	14303460	Interesting.
14303460	14306460	Yeah, because she doesn't want to share it, though.
14306460	14307460	Yeah.
14307460	14311460	There's a prize attached to it, so...
14311460	14312460	so there was...
14312460	14313460	so that...
14313460	14315460	he said there was, like, a lot of discussion about who...
14315460	14317460	or was it the King and Stink that there was a lot of discussion
14317460	14319460	in the group of who...
14319460	14320460	Yeah.
14320460	14324460	But just for the King and Stink right now, so...
14324460	14326460	Well, Formation Towns as well.
14326460	14328460	I've done it before.
14328460	14331460	But actually, there was no discussion.
14331460	14332460	That's interesting.
14332460	14333460	You have a good point.
14333460	14335460	Yeah, there was no discussion for Formation Towns.
14335460	14337460	That means that everybody didn't get it.
14337460	14338460	Oh, yeah.
14338460	14340460	So that's why it's the way I take out statements.
14340460	14341460	Yeah.
14341460	14343460	But since there was a lot of discussion for, like,
14343460	14346460	payments, that means no one really knew who did it.
14346460	14348460	Who did Formation Towns?
14348460	14349460	I don't know.
14349460	14350460	It wasn't you.
14350460	14351460	I just joined the...
14351460	14352460	the thing in the...
14352460	14354460	well, Marie was stuck in France,
14354460	14356460	so that was the summer of last year.
14356460	14358460	That's when that happened.
14358460	14360460	But I did tell Tim Jeremy, like,
14360460	14362460	hey, he did it.
14362460	14363460	You know?
14363460	14364460	Yeah.
14364460	14366460	And, oh, God, oh, the whip, yeah.
14366460	14368460	Okay, so I...
14368460	14370460	at this point, I'm wondering, you know,
14370460	14372460	I was working with the FBI, the source.
14372460	14373460	Well, Emma said to me,
14373460	14376460	I need you to relay a message to the FBI.
14376460	14377460	I was like, what?
14377460	14379460	I said, yes, I want you to give these guys a message.
14379460	14380460	Okay.
14380460	14382460	I'm like, tell them about Formation Towns.
14382460	14385460	I want you to give them a list of people you've...
14385460	14386460	that are...
14386460	14387460	and I have it.
14387460	14388460	I can give you the email.
14388460	14390460	I'll just forward it to you when I get a chance.
14390460	14391460	Remind me, text me.
14391460	14392460	I don't forget.
14392460	14394460	And I gave it to Tim.
14394460	14395460	I gave it to Jeremy.
14395460	14396460	And they were not...
14396460	14397460	they were like, okay, great.
14397460	14398460	We don't really care.
14398460	14399460	Like, give one to a Deutsche Bank.
14399460	14401460	We don't care about Formation Towns.
14401460	14404460	And Emma felt like she was not heard by the FBI
14404460	14406460	because she wanted to help,
14406460	14408460	but she was not heard.
14408460	14409460	She was offering help.
14409460	14412460	She said, look, I'll give you guys the data.
14412460	14413460	You have a time limit.
14413460	14415460	That's why it's going to go live in a month.
14415460	14418460	I'll give you three months to find the information.
14418460	14420460	I'll forward it to you.
14420460	14421460	Okay.
14421460	14423460	I'm just writing a line to someone to text you.
14423460	14424460	Yeah.
14424460	14426460	I don't know if we got it.
14426460	14428460	That's what I'm writing.
14428460	14430460	Okay.
14430460	14431460	All right.
14431460	14433460	Any other signal groups that...
14433460	14435460	that you're part of that talk about hacking?
14435460	14436460	Yeah.
14436460	14437460	Well, they're all...
14437460	14439460	I mean, all the varied groups.
14439460	14441460	I call them varied groups, but they're all, like, options.
14441460	14442460	Oh, no.
14442460	14444460	The Formation Towns one is still like this.
14444460	14446460	But, you know, it's like...
14446460	14448460	Well, I mean, no one's really posted for like,
14448460	14449460	like seven months.
14449460	14450460	Still there.
14450460	14451460	Okay.
14451460	14453460	And I created a few groups of my own, you know,
14453460	14455460	up to a Deutsche Bank group.
14455460	14456460	It's generally like a Luke Harding
14456460	14458460	and much other journalists.
14458460	14460460	Oh, and every...
14460460	14461460	there's every...
14461460	14463460	once in a while, there's like a fun star chamber
14463460	14466460	where you get someone and everyone's going to stop at
14466460	14469460	and we put them in a group, you know, and we just sort of tap.
14469460	14471460	You know, see what they say.
14471460	14472460	Yeah.
14472460	14474460	Well, like Louise Matt, she put her in a group
14474460	14476460	and he started, you know, what the fuck are you doing?
14476460	14478460	Why did you say this about Scott's father?
14478460	14479460	Scott's father is a cop.
14479460	14480460	Oh.
14480460	14481460	She doxxed me.
14481460	14482460	Oh.
14482460	14483460	What the fuck are you doing?
14483460	14484460	Why are you going after his father?
14484460	14486460	You know, he's like, well, he's a Russian spy.
14486460	14487460	You know, you're just fucking crazy.
14487460	14489460	Do you understand what you're fucking doing?
14489460	14490460	That's weird.
14490460	14491460	Yeah.
14491460	14492460	I think...
14492460	14494460	Like, David Adderidge was supposed to be in one
14494460	14497460	group for COVID, the next guy.
14497460	14498460	It was a prize.
14498460	14500460	It was a present for me.
14500460	14503460	It's like a little beat down room.
14503460	14504460	Yeah.
14504460	14505460	That's weird.
14505460	14507460	Hey, what are you talking about?
14507460	14508460	What are you talking about?
14508460	14509460	I'm talking about you.
14509460	14510460	What?
14510460	14511460	Cool.
14511460	14513460	Anything else that I missed?
14513460	14515460	Anything else that you think that...
14515460	14516460	Yes.
14516460	14517460	I'm just...
14517460	14518460	I can't remember all I have.
14518460	14519460	Yeah, sure.
14519460	14521460	But it's the eyes of me.
14521460	14523460	If I remember...
14523460	14525460	I just...
14525460	14527460	I will remember it.
14527460	14529460	I have to be in a mindset.
14529460	14530460	Sure.
14530460	14532460	You know, I mean, like...
14532460	14534460	your memory is...
14534460	14535460	Yeah.
14536460	14538460	Yeah, I was going to ask you about something very specific.
14538460	14540460	You could recall more about them.
14540460	14541460	Tell me everything you know about everything.
14541460	14543460	And right now, I'm like a...
14543460	14544460	I'm not even active anymore.
14544460	14546460	I'm meeting stuff right now from my memory
14546460	14547460	because I'm in this room.
14547460	14548460	And I'm a little bit nervous.
14548460	14549460	I'm a bit not nervous.
14549460	14551460	So my brain is adapted to that point.
14551460	14553460	So as soon as I walk out of the room,
14553460	14554460	I'm like, oh, we're going to say that.
14554460	14555460	Yeah, yeah.
14555460	14556460	You know what I mean?
14556460	14557460	Okay.
14557460	14558460	So...
14558460	14559460	Okay.
14559460	14560460	Anything else that...
14560460	14561460	Oh, in turn?
14561460	14562460	Yeah.
14562460	14563460	Okay.
14563460	14564460	Well, you saw my number so quick.
14564460	14566460	Do you think of something that...
14566460	14568460	you think would be interested in, you know...
14568460	14569460	surely you can always let me know
14569460	14570460	and I can find a home for it.
14570460	14571460	You think?
14571460	14573460	And do you mean to prosecute?
14573460	14574460	Do you mean to go after it?
14574460	14577460	Do you mean to like to read that is...
14577460	14578460	that needs to be stopped?
14578460	14579460	Or would you say it's like,
14579460	14582460	oh, there's some fun just in hacks happening?
14582460	14583460	What do you mean?
14583460	14585460	I mean, all those things are...
14585460	14588460	I work a very narrow spectrum, right?
14588460	14589460	I work cyber-friendly.
14589460	14590460	Okay.
14590460	14591460	But there's...
14591460	14592460	You're a fraud, though.
14592460	14593460	Yeah.
14593460	14595460	But there's also like counter-terrorism
14595460	14596460	or white collar crimes
14596460	14598460	or practicing as some children
14598460	14600460	in national security threats.
14600460	14602460	Oh, there's a couple lawyers.
14602460	14603460	Okay.
14603460	14604460	So I get...
14604460	14605460	There's people that call...
14605460	14607460	they claim to be lawyers.
14607460	14608460	Okay.
14608460	14610460	And they ask me to do a bunch of stuff.
14610460	14612460	First they'll have to do very strange data
14612460	14614460	and then they say they're fighting and doing a lawsuit
14614460	14616460	against like Iran or something like that
14616460	14619460	on behalf of the veterans.
14619460	14621460	They have to go collect data for them.
14621460	14623460	And it's mostly just...
14623460	14625460	I don't know why they're asking.
14625460	14627460	I thought it was some spy.
14627460	14629460	Oh, like you think they were asking...
14629460	14631460	when they collect data,
14631460	14633460	you think it was one of the most...
14633460	14634460	Yeah.
14634460	14636460	They're asking you to have it.
14636460	14639460	And I know these two guys out of DC...
14639460	14641460	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
14641460	14642460	They...
14642460	14643460	I told them to go fuck off,
14643460	14644460	but they did fly out here.
14644460	14645460	Yeah.
14645460	14647460	I mean, they had their e-mail accounts.
14647460	14648460	Yeah, no.
14648460	14650460	Iran, do you mind if I do that for you?
14650460	14651460	Sure.
14651460	14652460	Because they're...
14652460	14653460	there's something about them that's very off.
14653460	14655460	They flew all the way out here from DC
14655460	14658460	and then there was a very weird fucking...
14658460	14659460	there was a weird experience
14659460	14660460	what happened after that.
14660460	14661460	Oh, I thought it was true.
14661460	14662460	Yeah.
14662460	14665460	You did this to hack into Iran?
14665460	14668460	No, no, they wanted...
14668460	14670460	wire information about money being sent
14670460	14673460	from anywhere, any bank to Iran
14673460	14676460	during 2009.
14676460	14678460	It was just during the Gulf War, please.
14678460	14679460	Okay.
14679460	14682460	Well, it actually included Iran in 2010 as well.
14682460	14683460	Okay.
14683460	14684460	I'll...
14684460	14686460	I'll e-mail you and do one.
14686460	14687460	But, um...
14687460	14689460	So the plan right now is...
14689460	14690460	I know a Russian guy.
14690460	14692460	He works through it, let's say.
14692460	14693460	That must be...
14693460	14694460	Yeah.
14694460	14695460	Or he used to work for us.
14695460	14696460	Okay.
14696460	14698460	And he really wants to be an American.
14698460	14700460	So he can be of very...
14700460	14702460	very useful guy to you.
14702460	14703460	What do you think?
14703460	14704460	Me too.
14704460	14705460	Me too?
14705460	14706460	Yeah.
14706460	14708460	But be careful, because, like, you know,
14708460	14709460	he's being monitored.
14709460	14710460	Mm-hmm.
14710460	14711460	So, uh...
14711460	14713460	you know, a person died.
14713460	14714460	I did not want to...
14714460	14715460	he was a good guy.
14715460	14716460	He was a good guy.
14716460	14717460	Or is he good?
14717460	14718460	Yeah.
14718460	14719460	He's traveling all over the world.
14719460	14720460	He doesn't have to go back to Russia.
14720460	14721460	He keeps being...
14721460	14722460	getting...
14722460	14723460	He's accepted.
14723460	14725460	So he doesn't have to go back.
14725460	14727460	And he keeps trying to, you know,
14727460	14729460	ask me all, like,
14729460	14731460	is there a way or a business?
14731460	14732460	Can you introduce me to someone?
14732460	14733460	So, like, Bali...
14733460	14735460	He's a really good coder.
14735460	14736460	I don't know.
14736460	14737460	He's a good kind of guy.
14737460	14738460	But, yeah.
14738460	14739460	Uh, that would be very helpful for you,
14739460	14740460	because he does know a lot.
14740460	14741460	Well, how do you...
14741460	14742460	How do you know me?
14742460	14743460	I'm just gonna...
14743460	14744460	Uh-huh, traveling.
14744460	14745460	Yeah.
14745460	14746460	Yeah.
14746460	14747460	He's a girlfriend.
14747460	14748460	A girlfriend is the daughter
14748460	14750460	of a military general.
14750460	14751460	That's why.
14751460	14752460	Very interesting.
14752460	14754460	Um, I think he was the...
14754460	14755460	he was a...
14755460	14758460	he was tired of making military journals.
14758460	14759460	He came to...
14759460	14761460	We don't have this position in America,
14761460	14762460	but it's like a...
14762460	14764460	a nice speaker at the house.
14764460	14765460	It's like a...
14765460	14767460	It's not a attorney general,
14767460	14770460	but somewhere along the lines of a attorney general.
14770460	14772460	Um, he's got...
14772460	14773460	Yeah.
14773460	14775460	That would be a very interesting theme.
14775460	14776460	Yeah.
14776460	14777460	I mean, and like I said,
14777460	14778460	a lot of these things,
14778460	14779460	I won't work.
14779460	14780460	So, like, well,
14780460	14781460	there's, I'll take the information,
14781460	14782460	I'll give it to someone else,
14782460	14783460	and see if they want to pursue it,
14783460	14784460	and they'll probably talk to yours
14784460	14785460	and the like that.
14785460	14786460	Okay.
14786460	14787460	Okay.
14787460	14788460	Anyway, that's all good stuff.
14788460	14790460	Um, I'd like to do...
14790460	14791460	You can install my number
14791460	14792460	so you can always, you know,
14792460	14793460	reach out to me
14793460	14794460	if you forget something or...
14794460	14795460	Sure.
14795460	14796460	You know, think of something later.
14796460	14797460	Um...
14797460	14798460	Where does Marla go?
14798460	14799460	Yeah.
14799460	14800460	So, as far as Marla goes,
14800460	14801460	like I said, I think
14801460	14803460	our primary goal will still be to
14803460	14804460	make sure you look good
14804460	14805460	for the investigation.
14805460	14806460	Right?
14806460	14807460	Um...
14807460	14808460	But I can look good.
14808460	14809460	I don't know what you mean.
14809460	14810460	Like, just make sure
14810460	14811460	that the investigator sees
14811460	14812460	everything that he or she
14812460	14813460	is supposed to see,
14813460	14815460	as far as making you
14815460	14816460	and Marla, you know,
14816460	14817460	good parents,
14817460	14818460	and super, uh,
14818460	14819460	an adult.
14819460	14820460	But my worry, though,
14820460	14821460	is that it's already
14821460	14822460	it's back again
14822460	14823460	just purposely.
14823460	14824460	I don't know why.
14824460	14825460	Again, I just feel like
14825460	14826460	you did it,
14826460	14827460	and take the time in it.
14827460	14829460	Um, so even if we do show
14829460	14830460	our best stage
14830460	14831460	and we're the most perfect people
14831460	14832460	in the world,
14832460	14833460	you'll see it.
14833460	14834460	When you read the report,
14834460	14835460	you'll see what they did.
14835460	14838460	And now it can be...
14838460	14839460	I don't know how to fight that,
14839460	14840460	but it's something I don't know.
14840460	14842460	It's tough not to crack, too,
14842460	14843460	because, like I said,
14843460	14844460	I mean,
14844460	14846460	what would you suggest
14846460	14847460	that we do to influence
14847460	14849460	what's already been written
14849460	14850460	or how the proceedings
14850460	14852460	will go on from here?
14852460	14854460	Well, I had, you know,
14854460	14855460	my advantage,
14855460	14856460	uh,
14856460	14857460	fucking thing dismissed
14857460	14859460	based on their terrible, uh,
14859460	14860460	obviously,
14860460	14861460	no deep process
14861460	14862460	and misjudgment.
14862460	14863460	I wrote down a list
14863460	14864460	for reaction.
14864460	14865460	Um,
14865460	14866460	the lies
14866460	14867460	are caught in camera.
14867460	14868460	Right.
14868460	14869460	Versus what they wrote
14869460	14870460	in the report.
14870460	14871460	And it'll be good
14871460	14872460	if you can collect all the evidence
14872460	14873460	so that you can show that
14873460	14874460	to the judge or whomever.
14874460	14875460	Like,
14875460	14876460	I assume you're going to fire...
14876460	14877460	You fired your attorney
14877460	14878460	to hire a new one.
14878460	14879460	Like,
14879460	14880460	you know,
14880460	14881460	because it's probably good
14881460	14882460	to get an attorney.
14882460	14883460	Because that was another thing
14883460	14884460	I wanted to gauge
14884460	14885460	what you could do
14885460	14886460	and do we need an attorney
14886460	14887460	based on what you could do?
14887460	14888460	I mean,
14888460	14889460	just my personal thing,
14889460	14890460	I would probably want an attorney
14890460	14891460	based on what I was in your situation.
14891460	14892460	And I just, you know,
14892460	14893460	this is why people make money
14893460	14894460	and you can see it in color.
14894460	14895460	Right.
14895460	14896460	And like,
14896460	14897460	yeah,
14897460	14898460	and if this is completely not
14898460	14899460	F.D.I.
14899460	14900460	but just having friends
14900460	14901460	that have gone through the work
14901460	14902460	that you want to have a lawyer.
14902460	14903460	Yeah.
14903460	14904460	I mean,
14904460	14905460	you know,
14905460	14906460	where you can have a lawyer
14906460	14907460	and an attorney.
14907460	14908460	You can retell me that
14908460	14909460	if you want me to be your lawyer.
14909460	14910460	I swear to God,
14910460	14911460	you said that.
14911460	14912460	I mean,
14912460	14913460	I love you very much.
14913460	14914460	Yeah.
14914460	14915460	It's good that you trust
14915460	14916460	you that much.
14916460	14917460	I've been...
14917460	14918460	Oh, no,
14918460	14919460	it's not good.
14919460	14920460	I'm just saying that
14920460	14921460	a lawyer can represent himself
14921460	14922460	as a cool friend.
14922460	14923460	I said,
14923460	14924460	if you're representing yourself
14924460	14925460	in America,
14925460	14926460	you're going to laugh at
14926460	14927460	the crazy breaking,
14927460	14928460	okay?
14928460	14929460	And if the boyfriend
14929460	14930460	represents the girlfriend,
14930460	14931460	you can work,
14931460	14932460	right?
14932460	14933460	And maybe this will also
14933460	14934460	help the young
14934460	14935460	and the vulnerable.
14935460	14936460	Okay.
14936460	14939460	And the court is a lot,
14939460	14940460	a lot,
14940460	14941460	a lot of emotions,
14941460	14942460	right?
14942460	14943460	Always remember
14943460	14944460	that the judge
14944460	14945460	cares about nothing
14945460	14947460	except for the case.
14947460	14948460	Is it true, though?
14948460	14949460	Absolutely.
14949460	14951460	And think about it.
14951460	14952460	Think about it
14952460	14954460	from this perspective.
14954460	14955460	Their whole purpose
14955460	14956460	for existing
14956460	14957460	is to ensure
14957460	14958460	the safety of children.
14958460	14959460	That's what I want to
14959460	14960460	believe is true,
14960460	14961460	but that's not what I've seen.
14961460	14962460	I've seen only
14962460	14963460	people acting their
14963460	14964460	own self-interest.
14964460	14965460	I haven't seen anything
14965460	14966460	else like that
14966460	14967460	in this system.
14967460	14968460	Well,
14968460	14969460	when you talk about
14969460	14970460	the lack of
14970460	14971460	deep process in it,
14971460	14972460	something,
14972460	14973460	maybe some things are falling
14973460	14974460	apart here,
14974460	14975460	always come back
14975460	14976460	to what the judge
14976460	14978460	is going to ask
14978460	14980460	and answer those questions
14980460	14981460	for him.
14981460	14983460	Does that make sense?
14983460	14985460	Because one side is going to
14985460	14986460	say,
14986460	14987460	oh, this is best for the kids.
14987460	14988460	And your argument says,
14988460	14989460	this has to be
14989460	14990460	best for the kids.
14990460	14991460	That's what we're talking
14991460	14992460	about.
14992460	14993460	We got to make you
14993460	14994460	look better.
14994460	14995460	And you've got to make
14995460	14996460	yourself look better
14996460	14997460	than there's nothing
14997460	14998460	left.
14998460	14999460	Because then the judge
14999460	15000460	is going to wait until
15000460	15001460	and say,
15001460	15002460	this is a better place.
15002460	15003460	Was in the experience
15003460	15004460	judged like,
15004460	15005460	I heard
15005460	15006460	Dominion is to
15006460	15007460	know the difference
15007460	15008460	between the lies
15008460	15009460	and the fabrications.
15009460	15010460	To know the difference
15010460	15011460	between a crazy person
15011460	15012460	that's just calling
15012460	15013460	every day to
15013460	15014460	facility off
15014460	15015460	versus a person
15015460	15016460	that's concerned.
15016460	15017460	And how does the judge
15017460	15018460	weigh that
15018460	15019460	in front of them?
15019460	15020460	To weigh that with
15020460	15021460	what the judge
15021460	15022460	needed to lay it out
15022460	15023460	in front of them?
15023460	15024460	What's the
15024460	15025460	best kind of evidence
15025460	15026460	in front of them?
15026460	15027460	OK.
15027460	15028460	So you need
15028460	15029460	to, like,
15029460	15030460	get strong
15030460	15031460	and, again,
15031460	15032460	you know,
15032460	15033460	those are the lawyers
15033460	15034460	who, like,
15034460	15035460	you need to
15035460	15036460	try to organize
15036460	15037460	your response
15037460	15038460	to those, like,
15038460	15039460	your buttocks
15039460	15040460	because they're
15040460	15041460	representing the facts
15041460	15042460	to the judge, not.
15042460	15043460	I mean, you could, too.
15043460	15044460	No, you're right.
15044460	15045460	We're going to get there.
15045460	15046460	Yeah, OK.
15046460	15047460	But thank you, yeah.
15047460	15048460	I'm worried because
15048460	15049460	I looked up this judge
15049460	15050460	and her reviews were
15050460	15051460	not good.
15051460	15052460	And I don't expect her
15052460	15053460	to have any,
15053460	15054460	you know,
15054460	15055460	these are the
15055460	15056460	things.
15056460	15057460	But this was
15057460	15058460	100% bad.
15058460	15059460	There was nothing good.
15059460	15060460	I guess the people that
15060460	15061460	put these are more
15061460	15062460	motivated to write this.
15063460	15064460	I know that, too.
15064460	15065460	Like, I've read
15065460	15066460	through the lines.
15066460	15067460	I've been one
15067460	15068460	through lots of cases,
15068460	15069460	but I didn't see anybody say
15069460	15070460	she did great by
15070460	15071460	not one person.
15071460	15072460	I only see
15072460	15073460	she's married to another
15073460	15075460	judge in that same court.
15075460	15076460	I see he was
15076460	15077460	admonished for his
15077460	15078460	handling of the situation.
15078460	15079460	She was admonished for this.
15079460	15080460	They were,
15080460	15081460	they were
15081460	15082460	severe.
15082460	15083460	Like, I'm
15083460	15084460	I'm
15084460	15085460	I was focused on
15085460	15086460	what's successful,
15086460	15087460	the people that are successful,
15087460	15088460	right?
15088460	15089460	How were they successful?
15089460	15091460	They presented
15091460	15092460	evidence that
15092460	15093460	was more favorable
15093460	15094460	for each child.
15094460	15095460	Oh.
15096460	15097460	That's it.
15097460	15099460	It's very narrow,
15099460	15100460	and it's really narrow.
15100460	15101460	But I do that.
15101460	15102460	That's why I'm here.
15102460	15103460	That's why I'm frustrated.
15103460	15104460	Because this is what
15104460	15105460	I do.
15105460	15106460	Well, that's what
15106460	15107460	you need to give attorney.
15107460	15108460	It's clear.
15108460	15109460	It's clear.
15109460	15110460	If you walk in the room,
15110460	15111460	if you guys walk in there,
15111460	15112460	anybody who's walked
15112460	15113460	into my life
15113460	15115460	and read to Steve,
15115460	15116460	it's night and day.
15116460	15117460	Obviously,
15117460	15118460	Marla belongs to this.
15118460	15119460	It's,
15119460	15120460	I'm not saying that this is
15120460	15121460	subjectively.
15121460	15122460	I mean, I am,
15122460	15123460	but it's clear.
15123460	15124460	But to have these
15124460	15125460	these people do that
15125460	15127460	and come up with
15127460	15128460	this,
15128460	15129460	when you read it,
15129460	15130460	you'll see.
15130460	15131460	It's,
15131460	15132460	that scares me
15132460	15133460	because that shows
15133460	15134460	that someone is
15134460	15135460	something else is going on.
15135460	15136460	There's something else
15136460	15137460	I don't know.
15137460	15138460	I don't know how to gauge it.
15138460	15139460	I don't know how to weigh it.
15139460	15140460	I don't know what it is
15140460	15141460	and scaring it.
15143460	15144460	It's not
15144460	15145460	how it should be.
15145460	15146460	You know,
15146460	15147460	it's how it should be.
15147460	15148460	That's the problem.
15148460	15149460	I held you earlier.
15149460	15150460	We're honest.
15150460	15151460	I'll be honest with you now.
15151460	15152460	It's just scary.
15152460	15154460	It's just scary things.
15154460	15155460	That's,
15155460	15157460	that's Marie's child
15157460	15158460	but it's also yours.
15158460	15159460	So,
15159460	15161460	you've got to focus on those things.
15161460	15162460	And I'll,
15162460	15163460	and I'll give you something.
15163460	15164460	I'm not going to try
15164460	15165460	but hearing this,
15165460	15167460	some of what I picked up on
15167460	15169460	is an allegation of a beard,
15169460	15170460	of a bruise.
15170460	15171460	Yeah.
15171460	15172460	A black eye.
15172460	15173460	Okay.
15173460	15174460	Don't be mad about the allegation.
15174460	15175460	How do you get privy?
15175460	15176460	I know,
15176460	15177460	but you can,
15177460	15178460	but that's why they picked the shit
15178460	15179460	that's hard to disprove.
15179460	15180460	How do I go and disprove your phone?
15180460	15181460	We have photos from the game.
15181460	15182460	Well,
15182460	15183460	you said you also had a video crew
15183460	15184460	that was following you.
15184460	15185460	We have a video crew
15185460	15186460	and we have photos of Marlon
15186460	15187460	from that day.
15187460	15188460	Okay.
15188460	15189460	So,
15189460	15190460	so then someone says,
15190460	15191460	oh, well,
15191460	15192460	you need to produce those
15192460	15194460	to show that that allegation is false.
15194460	15196460	You just have to focus on that.
15196460	15197460	Does that make sense?
15197460	15198460	That's,
15198460	15199460	yeah,
15199460	15200460	I mean,
15200460	15201460	like it's easy.
15201460	15202460	And you need to.
15202460	15203460	It sounds easy.
15203460	15204460	I can do that
15204460	15205460	but they can only say
15205460	15206460	something else.
15206460	15207460	How do you disprove Marlon
15207460	15208460	going through the trash?
15208460	15209460	Scouraging for food?
15209460	15210460	How do I disprove that?
15210460	15211460	At 1 a.m.,
15211460	15212460	she says,
15212460	15213460	he's going through the trash
15213460	15214460	alone,
15214460	15215460	trying to get food out of
15215460	15216460	garbage dumpsters.
15216460	15217460	Marlon,
15217460	15218460	an eight-year-old.
15218460	15219460	How do I disprove that?
15219460	15220460	And that's,
15220460	15221460	that's the thing.
15221460	15222460	You can't disprove it.
15222460	15223460	You can't prove a negative, right?
15223460	15224460	You can't disprove.
15224460	15225460	Go disprove it.
15225460	15226460	You're not,
15226460	15227460	tell me,
15227460	15228460	prove me you're not guilty.
15228460	15229460	A little garlet letter?
15229460	15230460	Yeah.
15230460	15231460	Yeah.
15231460	15232460	That's,
15232460	15233460	that's,
15233460	15234460	that's,
15234460	15235460	that's what I'm trying to say.
15235460	15236460	I'm trying to go to the
15236460	15237460	top of these lawyers.
15237460	15238460	Like,
15238460	15239460	they've seen it all.
15239460	15240460	They've seen,
15240460	15241460	you know,
15241460	15242460	they've probably seen
15242460	15243460	elements of your story before
15243460	15244460	and they know what,
15244460	15245460	they hopefully they will know
15245460	15248460	what a good response to those
15248460	15249460	things are.
15249460	15250460	And another thing,
15250460	15251460	it's not just being a good,
15251460	15252460	like,
15252460	15253460	you can be a vicious,
15253460	15254460	hard-going lawyer,
15254460	15255460	but if you don't understand
15255460	15256460	and you don't understand
15256460	15257460	the process,
15257460	15258460	how are you going to be
15258460	15259460	at the other side,
15259460	15260460	whether you want or not?
15260460	15261460	Yes.
15261460	15262460	You have to understand
15262460	15262960	Yes.
15262960	15264960	You have to understand your situation.
15264960	15265460	We don't.
15265460	15265960	We don't.
15265960	15266960	He didn't tell us anything.
15266960	15269960	He didn't want that job to be done.
15269960	15271960	He was using us for his own case.
15271960	15273460	Can you see that's pretty tricky?
15273460	15276960	I can't tell you what to do with your attorney to fire that and get a new one or what kind
15276960	15277460	of attorney.
15277460	15284460	I just can't do that because I think I'm starting to be in a certain spot as any human would
15284460	15285960	just do any process.
15285960	15288960	You have to understand the other side of it.
15288960	15289460	I did.
15289460	15294460	I'm telling you, we accidentally put ourselves in the middle of another case.
15294460	15297460	We're being used for someone else's case.
15297460	15304460	The lawyer we found, the woman that we recall, wants us to help her with her bigger case.
15304460	15305960	That's what we're used for.
15305960	15308460	So our lawyer was not working our best interest.
15308460	15311460	He's working for his best interest and her best interest.
15311460	15312460	That's the problem.
15312460	15321460	And that's why I'm fucking, that woman, the judge, knows that because he's been working
15321460	15324460	in that group for 30, 20 years.
15324460	15325460	Everyone knows each other.
15325460	15326460	It's so ancestral down there.
15326460	15330460	She knows that, but she's still accepted that what she did.
15330460	15331460	And that scares me too.
15331460	15332460	He's judged.
15332460	15338460	The whole thing used to be, you have to get paternal affairs down there and fucking clean this place up because something's wrong here.
15338460	15340460	And these are children.
15340460	15341460	It's fucked up.
15341460	15343460	You know, they think they're above the law now.
15343460	15344460	These people are down there.
15344460	15345460	It's fucked up.
15345460	15346460	The egos are so big.
15346460	15347460	Nope.
15347460	15351460	Like, I've seen big egos, like bankers, like billionaires.
15351460	15354460	They don't say anything against these lawyers and the judges.
15354460	15355460	It's crazy.
15355460	15357460	But we don't have your back.
15357460	15359460	We're going to have your case.
15359460	15362460	That's what I'm telling you.
15362460	15370460	For example, he said, clear as day in writing, I am counsel for Bob Brooksman.
15370460	15371460	Marie calls him last night.
15371460	15372460	We record the conversation.
15372460	15373460	He doesn't know.
15373460	15378460	Why didn't you say to Tim and Lucy that you were Vowell's counsel?
15378460	15379460	I'll fucking Vowell.
15379460	15380460	Don't listen to him.
15380460	15382460	He doesn't know what he's talking about.
15382460	15383460	Vowell's an idiot.
15383460	15384460	Vowell's a bully.
15384460	15385460	He's going to ruin you.
15385460	15386460	He's going to screw up your case.
15386460	15387460	You need to drop Vowell.
15387460	15389460	No, but you didn't answer my question.
15389460	15391460	How is it that you said this?
15391460	15393460	I mean, it's right here in the email.
15393460	15394460	I'm looking at it.
15394460	15395460	I did not say that, Marie.
15395460	15396460	I said, I'm your counsel.
15396460	15397460	I'm Marie's counsel.
15397460	15398460	And I'm here to help.
15398460	15399460	That's it.
15399460	15400460	You want to talk about this?
15400460	15401460	You want to talk about going with Vowell?
15401460	15402460	I can walk away anytime.
15402460	15405460	I don't need this case for 30 minutes of this.
15405460	15406460	All right.
15406460	15408460	He was denying reality.
15408460	15409460	Okay.
15409460	15410460	That's scary.
15410460	15411460	That's your attorney.
15411460	15412460	That was our attorney.
15412460	15413460	That's my attorney.
15413460	15414460	That's your attorney.
15414460	15417460	Yeah, but that's also the relationship with the judge.
15417460	15418460	That's what I'm saying.
15418460	15420460	It's like that, don't it?
15420460	15423460	It seems like we're correcting it from wrong.
15423460	15426460	Your frustration is that you believe that there's corruption at the judicial level.
15426460	15427460	Like the judge is corrupt.
15427460	15428460	Yeah.
15428460	15429460	That's the problem.
15429460	15430460	Absolutely.
15430460	15431460	Yeah.
15431460	15432460	So, yeah.
15432460	15433460	No experience with this at all.
15433460	15435460	I'm just telling you, my experience with this is where I talk.
15435460	15439460	Well, it's because nothing we can tell you about the process is going to make any sense
15439460	15441460	if you don't trust the system, right?
15441460	15444460	Because right now you don't trust the system because you think the judge is corrupt, right?
15444460	15447460	So, then the question is, what is our solution?
15447460	15448460	We can't just correct the problem, right?
15448460	15449460	That's right.
15449460	15450460	We have to find a solution to it.
15450460	15453460	And I cannot be, I can't be an asshole and just do it for myself.
15453460	15455460	And that's why I say, well, there's other people's children.
15455460	15459460	So, if I read about our mind about their kids being taken away from them, we can't...
15459460	15460460	Hold on.
15460460	15461460	Hold on.
15461460	15462460	Right?
15462460	15466460	So, like, we can talk all day with you about how to help you.
15466460	15471460	But if you don't trust the judge, nothing that we can say is going to make any difference, right?
15471460	15477460	So, as far as being a corrupt judge, like if you wanted us to investigate the judge for
15477460	15481460	public corruption or something like that, that's a whole other case, a whole other issue that
15481460	15484460	we would have to resolve that would take years.
15484460	15486460	It's not going to help you.
15486460	15488460	So, how do you navigate it?
15488460	15489460	Right, right.
15489460	15494460	So, the best advice I can give you is that, as unfair as it sounds right now, there seems
15494460	15497460	like there's a lot of things that are going on with the judge.
15497460	15499460	What we've talked about is true.
15499460	15502460	The judges do have a kid that interests that hand.
15502460	15507460	Like, you can form a whole conspiracy about why this judge wants to take Marlowe away from
15507460	15508460	you.
15508460	15509460	And it's about Marlowe.
15509460	15512460	And that's what we have to focus on, right?
15512460	15516460	Because if the judge is trying to, you know, screw someone over...
15516460	15518460	You're going back to the same...
15518460	15524460	Okay, so, what's our solution going to be for a corrupt judge that is just out to fuck
15524460	15525460	everyone?
15525460	15526460	That's not what I'm saying.
15526460	15527460	I'm not saying...
15527460	15529460	Do you know how it comes off?
15529460	15533460	Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like that.
15533460	15542460	I mean, in this specific case, we accidentally found a lawyer that has an agenda to get another
15542460	15543460	guy, right?
15543460	15548460	We fell into this trap, into a circle of friends, they're like a cabal, they're very close to
15548460	15550460	each other, they're married to each other for fuck's sake.
15550460	15553460	You know each other very well for 20 plus years.
15553460	15557460	They feel like they're above the law, they have their own law structure there.
15557460	15560460	They decide what happens, not the law.
15560460	15567460	And we saw accidentally the triple lambing out into this little cabal and we became a
15567460	15569460	tool all of a sudden.
15569460	15573460	Now, when we drop this guy, he's not going to be happy about that.
15573460	15575460	He knows the judge very well.
15575460	15577460	Very fucking well, they're very close.
15577460	15578460	You can see it in the...
15578460	15580460	You know, they say don't record...
15580460	15581460	You know how they record this shit?
15581460	15582460	The trials?
15582460	15584460	They fucking record everything.
15584460	15591460	You know, and so we went through it last night and heard again how he did not defend us.
15591460	15593460	I mean, I don't want to get too much into it.
15593460	15598460	We actively tried to get him out of the room knowing that Murray was lying in the belt
15598460	15599460	under the room, don't worry about it.
15599460	15602460	You know Murray, you really have to get him out of the room.
15602460	15604460	And that's our lawyer throwing us under the bus.
15604460	15606460	And the judge knew it.
15606460	15608460	I don't know how to describe it.
15608460	15612460	You think if you had a new lawyer it would change the situation?
15612460	15613460	No.
15614460	15617460	But that's a solution, I think, on the table right now.
15617460	15618460	I don't know.
15618460	15621460	There might be a good guy, like a stand-up guy.
15621460	15624460	And he's told us it's a whole other system down there.
15624460	15628460	You need to get a lawyer that's court ordered that knows that system.
15628460	15629460	You know, that's your best bet.
15629460	15632460	I can get you an expensive lawyer that can do it for you, too.
15632460	15635460	But he's not going to be as good as the people that are in that court.
15635460	15637460	And that means that it is corrupt.
15637460	15638460	They do it amongst each other.
15638460	15642460	They have their own star chambers, certain things.
15642460	15647460	And so it's Sava who's creating fucking evidence, and she's a social worker.
15647460	15650460	She's supposed to have the child's best interests at heart.
15650460	15651460	That is her.
15651460	15654460	When she was hired she could pay $100,000 a year to do that.
15654460	15656460	And the other guy, 200,000,000.
15656460	15658460	They're supposed to be good at their job.
15658460	15660460	Comes in and starts fucking lying.
15660460	15662460	And changing the narrative, read it.
15662460	15664460	See how the narrative changed after page 15?
15664460	15666460	The narrative changed dramatically.
15666460	15667460	You'll see.
15667460	15669460	How do you fight that?
15669460	15671460	That's fucked up.
15672460	15673660	That's what's fucked up.
15673660	15676900	What I was my plan was if I am all I have options,
15676900	15679940	I'm going to throw it onto the group, more than three
15679940	15681740	of them, and say, look, this is a problem.
15681740	15683340	I need your help.
15683340	15684660	What can you do?
15684660	15688500	And that's done with my last, but then you got something.
15688500	15689000	It's good.
15689000	15691180	I want to get that was my other choice.
15691180	15693060	Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
15693060	15694940	And it's from Marlowe, I got to go do it.
15694940	15696540	No, totally.
15696540	15699780	I mean, in a year, you said to walk away from here,
15699780	15702260	but look at other references for lawyers.
15702260	15704980	Because you always think about a dad or a friend.
15704980	15707540	They had their own reasons for introducing you
15707540	15709220	to that lawyer.
15709220	15712060	So if you're bowling under and hearing me, it's systemic.
15712060	15715740	Like, I'm not having a great, great burden in the world.
15715740	15717020	It wins everything.
15717020	15719820	But not in this world, because this world is
15719820	15721420	run by these people.
15721420	15722900	They make their own goals.
15722900	15727580	The law that was first followed, they create their own laws.
15727580	15728460	That's a problem.
15729420	15731180	Let's read the reader for us.
15731180	15736740	I think it's going back to thinking about why we're better
15736740	15739380	off going in with a lawyer than by yourself.
15739380	15740380	Oh, yeah, yeah.
15740380	15741860	Yeah, I agree.
15741860	15742860	Absolutely.
15742860	15743860	No, absolutely.
15743860	15744860	Yeah.
15744860	15745860	I'm going with the lawyer.
15745860	15746860	We're fine with the lawyer.
15746860	15749340	The thing that we're trying to say,
15749340	15751660	like, here's the thing, you have to either trust
15751660	15753780	that what we're saying is from experience,
15753780	15755380	or you don't have to take our opinion.
15755380	15757100	I mean, it's just a opinion of three.
15757860	15759820	I'm just so media all the data, I just want
15759820	15761380	to make sure you have everything.
15761380	15763900	So the thing would be, if your attorney also
15763900	15767300	sees that there's this corrupt system where the judge is
15767300	15769100	in bed with everyone else, they may
15769100	15770220	be able to change a venue.
15770220	15771180	They need to do something.
15771180	15773260	But they would have that knowledge, right?
15773260	15774540	Like, I don't have it now.
15774540	15777180	They're not a, I don't do child custody battles,
15777180	15779500	but they need to be based on doubt defense, certainly.
15779500	15780940	A couple of different occasions.
15780940	15783980	But those are different situations, different judges
15783980	15784500	to people.
15784500	15786740	So whatever training you get, we'll
15786740	15788300	be able to look after your best interests.
15788300	15790180	The point would be, though, is you have to trust
15790180	15791740	that that attorney is going to be good,
15791740	15793700	and is going to be looking after your best interests.
15793700	15795540	So do your research, and we know we
15795540	15798180	can help with that, if that would be the best option.
15798180	15799980	But I'm trying to find a good solution for you,
15799980	15801740	because I don't want you to walk away from here thinking,
15801740	15803980	like, well, if I don't care, I do want to help you.
15803980	15806260	But we need to think of realistic ways we can help you.
15806260	15807820	And that would be the best way to do it.
15807820	15808820	Sorry, maybe you're right.
15808820	15809660	I'm just thinking.
15809660	15811860	So realistic way would be to play their game,
15811860	15813700	find out what their rules are, and play their game.
15813700	15816700	So that's the end of it.
15817660	15819540	I mean, I don't want you to be upset.
15819540	15821860	I mean, it's not emotional, and I understand.
15821860	15823060	I've always started throwing out there,
15823060	15824820	seeing that we're interested in doing this whole,
15824820	15827420	let's take down the system and create a new system in its place.
15827420	15829420	But I don't think you're there yet.
15829420	15831220	But I do want to do that at some point.
15831220	15832980	But right now, I have to get Marla focused.
15832980	15834940	I'm just going to say, right now, it's play their game.
15834940	15835780	That's fine.
15835780	15836660	It's perfectly fine.
15836660	15841620	But yeah, OK, no worries.
15841620	15844660	And I think some of those things are going to be in your dress.
15844660	15845540	You all right?
15845540	15851660	Yeah, I think there's a lot of a year of that whole process.
15851660	15856060	When we talk here, and I think what I want to make sure you
15856060	15859020	understand is that we'll focus on the game special,
15859020	15861620	because that's your immediate need, right?
15861620	15863540	And then there's the overall need.
15863540	15865460	What can we solve quickly?
15865460	15866820	What needs to be addressed quickly?
15866820	15871060	And then the bigger thing, the bigger aspect of it.
15871060	15876180	It's not that we're not interested in that, because we are.
15876180	15878380	Yeah, one thing at a time.
15878380	15881740	Well, you're here right here.
15881740	15884500	What's your number one goal?
15884500	15886380	Marla, right?
15886380	15888780	So when you ask a question, it's not
15888780	15892860	that we're side stepping the issues, whatever it is.
15892860	15896100	We're focused on, because we're addressing.
15896100	15897540	Oh, no, absolutely.
15897540	15898420	You're sorry.
15898420	15900180	Yes, I hope that you didn't think
15901140	15904460	No, I don't think it's such a, I just, I do this all the time,
15904460	15907140	because I mean with this book, I just think you guys,
15907140	15909100	you don't know all the data, and if you just knew all the data,
15909100	15911340	you'd see how I see it.
15911340	15912660	That's what I'm thinking.
15912660	15913740	It doesn't mean it's true.
15913740	15915300	But it's important to me.
15915300	15920260	And yeah, as what you do, and what I've committed myself to do,
15920260	15922660	is I want you to understand what we're coming from.
15922660	15924260	I don't want you to walk away like,
15924260	15925740	I don't want to give a shit about the bigger problems.
15925740	15926900	No, you do.
15926900	15928860	But right now, you're in front of us.
15928940	15929780	How do we help you out?
15929780	15932260	Okay, thank you.
15932260	15934700	And thank you again.
15934700	15936500	And again, that's our opinion.
15936500	15940700	So it's not legal, it's just my opinion.
15940700	15941540	Cool.
15941540	15944260	And yeah, sorry, I know what you're doing.
15944260	15948300	I wasn't, yeah, can we just throw that out there?
15948300	15950500	No, no, no, I just want to, sometimes,
15950500	15952380	I think it's always better,
15952380	15953700	and maybe this is a fault of mine,
15953700	15955700	is to be more articulate and clear,
15955700	15958100	and to clarify stuff, so that when we walk away,
15958100	15962140	we're clear about what the perception was,
15962140	15964820	or what the intent was, but not intent to accept.
15964820	15966780	I know your intent, yeah, no, I trust your intent,
15966780	15969780	absolutely, I do trust your intent, obviously.
15971260	15973180	That, yeah, and I hope you trust mine.
15974940	15976180	You can do something you can work on,
15976180	15979220	if you need me, like I told you before,
15979220	15980500	you know, if you can't do anything,
15980500	15983580	and I've been through that before with Tim and Jan,
15983580	15986340	and when they get stuck on some sort of bureaucratic thing,
15986340	15989460	I'm still happy about it, so, appreciate that.
15990780	15993340	Good deal, I think we got a good, good work and plan.
15994340	15996580	Maybe, I mean, I'll even try to do some research
15996580	15999060	on a lawyer for you, and give you some suggestions,
15999060	16000260	or something like that, I don't know,
16000260	16001380	we'll see what I can do.
16001380	16004220	I don't know, just do the same research you can do,
16004220	16006700	but at least I can give you a,
16006700	16008980	okay, well, this looks good, that doesn't look good,
16008980	16011460	but anyway, we'll go for that part first,
16011460	16012780	and then if you find anything else,
16012780	16015340	then you can tell us who would be good.
16015340	16018780	I'll, can you do more specific with help with?
16018780	16021060	Yeah, I mean, do you know what I'm doing now?
16021060	16022420	Yeah, yeah.
16022420	16024060	So, like, today was just to assess
16024060	16026940	what kind of access you have, or what kind of skills you have.
16026940	16028780	So what I'll do is I'll write this up and ask around,
16028780	16030300	like maybe there's someone who might call a crime
16030300	16032900	who has, you know, a need for something
16032900	16034940	that you can help with, and then I'll find them and say,
16034940	16035940	hey, this is what he's got,
16035940	16038020	this is the skills he has, this is the access he has.
16038020	16040180	That's all based on what we've said today.
16040180	16041220	That's why if there's anything else
16041220	16043700	that you have access to, or crimes that you're aware of,
16043700	16045140	all those things are useful,
16045140	16047060	because then we can use that to say,
16047060	16048700	okay, this person can use you to this person.
16048700	16049540	Oh, okay.
16049540	16050380	Does that make sense?
16050380	16051220	Yeah, it makes sense.
16051220	16053340	Right now, we're just the gatekeepers
16053340	16055980	of your information, like, you give us the information,
16055980	16057780	we send it out to other bureau people,
16057780	16059620	because we can't have 800 people in the room right now.
16059620	16061460	Right, right, so it's a placement.
16061460	16062300	That's right, okay.
16062300	16063140	Okay, yeah.
16063140	16064100	That's the whole reason we're here,
16064100	16066220	is just to see what you can provide us
16066220	16068100	so that we can help you, make sense.
16068100	16071700	Okay, I will be putting a list of journalism.
16071700	16072540	Right.
16072900	16074180	Any questions you can always give?
16074180	16075540	Don't get to anybody.
16075540	16079660	And I can, I'm not, I can't get anything,
16079660	16082140	but I can get a pretty good amount of data.
16083500	16085220	And it would be a more specific ask, too.
16085220	16087300	We would say, okay, hey, do you know
16087300	16090260	next person at the Miami Herald or something like that?
16090260	16091500	What do you know about them?
16091500	16092340	And that would be someone else,
16092340	16093180	but wouldn't it be me?
16093180	16094780	Probably someone out of Miami, right?
16094780	16097540	So, anyway, we're gonna take all this stuff
16097540	16100740	and digest it, hopefully we can help you out at the same time.
16100740	16101580	But if you have any questions,
16101580	16105140	you can always give me a call or, you know,
16105140	16108060	so these guys are in LA, and I'm obviously in Houston,
16108060	16111060	but you know, either way, we can help you out, okay?
16111060	16114580	Okay, are you not gonna be an LA person?
16114580	16115420	No.
16115420	16116340	You're gonna be a Houston person.
16116340	16117620	I'm a Houston person, okay.
16117620	16119500	Yeah, so if anything develops,
16119500	16121220	you'll probably be having an idea.
16121220	16122900	Yeah, you're okay.
16122900	16126620	Okay, so you just came out here to discuss me.
16126620	16128620	Cool, man, thank you.
16128620	16130180	Glad to, thank you, kind of.
16130300	16131900	You can come all the way down there, right?
16131900	16132740	Yeah.
16133740	16135300	Oh, cool, I hope.
16135300	16136860	And I can't fill in there, right?
16136860	16137700	Yeah, please don't, yeah.
16137700	16139940	Not even that you had a being, or that you...
16139940	16141020	You live in Auburn, you know?
16141020	16141860	Is she okay?
16141860	16142700	Yeah, I don't know.
16142700	16143700	Auburn, obviously, knows you being there.
16143700	16145740	So, I don't know if I've seen her, but...
16145740	16146700	I wouldn't tell her anything,
16146700	16148620	but if I were to talk about it,
16148620	16149940	or if she's told us...
16149940	16151700	You're not even going to talk about it.
16151700	16153660	You're not even going to talk about it, I mean...
16153660	16155580	I think anyone who's seen me,
16155580	16157900	personally, better, I'd be talking to her in 21.
16157900	16158740	That'd be great.
16158740	16161180	You'd be talking to her in 23.
16161180	16162020	Not funny.
16162020	16163740	Yeah, I would never hear you talking to her.
16163740	16164740	You'd be talking to her all the time.
16164740	16165580	I'd play to her.
16165580	16166620	No, she'd play to her.
16166620	16168020	She would.
16168020	16169820	Is she around today?
16169820	16170780	Yeah.
16170780	16172580	I can play by...
16172580	16173900	I don't know, I could still talk to her a lot.
16173900	16175020	You could play by.
16175020	16176460	Talk to her real quick, she'd talk to her.
16176460	16177900	You want to come by the class?
16177900	16179020	Yeah, I know, yeah.
16179020	16179860	We've got an hour.
16179860	16180700	Well, let's see.
16180700	16181540	Let me call her.
16181540	16183540	She should be getting out of work.
16183540	16185500	She'd be done by Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
16185500	16187340	Yeah, she'd send me a text to whatever.
16187340	16188900	I'd love to hear from her.
16188900	16189740	Sure.
16189740	16190580	She'd be on the run.
16190580	16193580	She was kind of, you know, having to...
16193580	16195420	She'd be on the run.
16195420	16196420	She'd be down to the head.
16196420	16197740	She'd be on the run.
16197740	16198580	Really?
16198580	16200420	Oh, yeah.
16200420	16201420	Right.
16201420	16203420	Yeah.
16203420	16204420	I'd be on the run.
16204420	16205420	Is that it?
16205420	16206420	I'd be on the run.
16206420	16207420	I'd be on the run.
16207420	16208420	I'd be on the run.
16208420	16209420	I'd be on the run.
