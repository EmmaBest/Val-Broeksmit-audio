Right now. Good.
Okay. Yeah.
Where are my phones?
Uh-huh. Where am I?
Deployed.
Deployed.
Oh, why don't you take these out for a second?
Okay.
One, two, three.
I don't think I like these jeans.
They're really great.
Yeah, very.
Yeah, especially when we run the run.
Okay.
Thank you, baby.
You're kind of...
Normal guy.
Normal guy?
Oh, good.
Cool.
Cool style.
Yeah.
Like, very stylish.
Nice.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't wear this stuff.
Okay.
Huh?
Oh, my cigarette.
Oh, yeah, my check.
I need that mask.
Okay.
And my cigarette loaves.
What are you using now?
Uh, later.
Like a small one.
Oh, I think I have one in my bag, actually.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, perfect.
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
This one scares me.
No.
That's not good.
You can put that somewhere else.
One, two, three.
Courage, huh?
Do you want to give me back all the other stuff?
The, um...
The bad greeners?
Yeah.
Do you want that back?
Yeah, this one.
Okay.
Yeah.
I can't do this one.
Okay.
Is it bad?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't do this.
I don't know if it's...
It's good.
It's good?
Yeah.
It's beautiful.
Oh, that's beautiful.
You...
I'm gonna picture you in your beauty.
Okay.
Wow.
Okay.
That's all.
That's all.
Um...
Maybe you can meet me if you come downstairs now.
Why don't you go by the building?
Come here.
Come here.
No, no, in front of the building.
Just get in there.
Just...
Just get your best friend in the building, please.
Why are you both doing that with your top?
That would be that, no.
This is not France in 1992.
Both shoulders off.
That's better.
That's what I'm talking about.
What?
I'm telling you to come down and meet me.
See, he's supposed to come down and meet me.
You have to sneak me in, remember?
He's heading down now.
Okay.
So, I'll say Marie wants me...
Do you do well?
Do you need to do well?
Yes, I do.
I'm saying you just want to briefly meet him and say hi.
Sure.
Okay.
Sure.
I'll miss you.
We'll keep you.
You want me to put some of this on this guy?
Yeah.
He's covered in this.
Okay.
I'm going to tell him we're outside in the parking lot.
You said it's cool to meet him, you can meet him.
We're outside in the parking lot.
Drop off your air.
Yeah, too.
Drop off your air.
Red Mini, you can't do this here.
Where is it?
Here.
What's up?
Okay.
Where is that?
I'm worried.
Aw, thank you.
Perfect.
Oh, yes.
Good idea, baby.
What?
That's a good one.
I like the pie.
Nice.
Okay.
You're not switching too much.
I am so hot.
There will be air con inside.
My story.
It's a cool thing because it's like an internet joint.
Yeah?
Look.
Super elegant.
You look super cool.
Super stylish.
Super fashionable.
I like it.
I need you.
It's the best thing.
Not as bad as me.
Do you want one of these or do you have another one?
Yes, good.
Well done.
Perfect.
Good, good, good.
That's what I'm talking about.
Smart.
See you again.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I'll give myself a bit.
Pipe.
That's what you can't use.
You have a band on your arm.
Is it your boyfriend?
Is it your husband?
Is it your boyfriend?
No, no, no.
Is it your controlling boyfriend?
They looked at me.
They were like...
Who?
Nothing.
What was the thing?
You have a band.
I just...
I did not know what it was to me.
Look, what did they...
Is it like...
No, I was cooking and...
They mean anything about it?
No, no.
They just looked at me and looked at me and looked at me.
Okay.
Hello.
How's my hair?
It's okay.
What's it?
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.
It just makes my hair look a little stupid.
It's okay.
It's weird.
It's okay?
We need some sun.
I know.
We need some sunglasses.
Oh my God, yeah.
Maybe we can do that today.
Oh, can you make appointments at the Apple Store for us?
Soon after your...
Your thing, we can go directly to the Apple Store.
You get a new pair of glasses.
We can go directly to the Apple Store.
You get a new phone.
So we're not being hacked by everybody.
Yes, you do, because you're hacked by everybody.
Okay.
No, but in your ear.
Oh, yeah?
Did you get them?
I don't...
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
No, but they're in there.
Oh, okay.
I know, it's annoying, but...
Not helpful.
It's really loud.
It's really, really super loud, baby.
I'm sorry.
You just can't blow my ears like that.
All right, so where are the plans today?
Today's plans.
Okay.
You're gonna do this.
Y'all on goes.
You might pick me up.
You might not.
So I'll take Uber and then go to...
Oh, shit.
Oh, no.
I left it inside.
Yeah, I need my keys.
Oh, there's the Fanta.
The pineapple Fanta?
Yeah.
Ah.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Perfect.
Oh, no.
One, two, three.
I got it.
Do you have to go?
Yeah, well, he's gonna come.
All right?
I told him Red Mini, you can't miss us.
Good night.
Yeah, just leave it here.
Yeah.
Put on the hazards.
Put the hazards on.
Nice.
Lock it, yeah.
Mr. Reed.
Mr. Reed.
Mr. Reed.
Hello, Mr. Reed.
There are four lights.
Do you have the lights on?
Yeah.
Yeah, running.
It's going right now.
What about this back?
See the back?
It sticks out?
I don't have the key.
No.
I don't have the key back.
I don't have the key.
I don't have the key.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You can fix that.
You did great.
You did great.
Oh, here we are.
Hello.
Hey.
It's Daniel.
David.
David Koh.
Nice to meet you.
Cheers.
This is Mary High.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry.
Oh, good play.
All right, Bo.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, good to be here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Remember I spoke the other night?
Yeah.
It's all right?
It's all right.
It's all right.
She almost killed me like five times getting here.
She's French and a woman.
She's got two cliches against her.
French and a woman.
Well, there's your first go.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
I got it.
I got it.
Oh, careful.
Remember to shake on my back.
Thank you.
All right, guys.
Thanks.
How's it going?
Good, good.
Boeing.
Is that your name, is that it?
Yeah.
Like the...
Oh, where's my mask?
Yeah.
The company, right?
Yeah.
Look at it.
Do your parents...
Is that the one staff that comes down?
Oh, my God.
There was some, but not for LA.
Okay.
Really weird.
So easy.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was part of our strategy.
Lightened up a little bit.
Sorry I'm late, though.
Oh, come on.
It's like LA.
You're from here.
It's...
You're not from here.
No, no, no.
Not me.
Not from here.
We're going to get you a visitor, guys.
What?
Is there a visitor?
Come on in, sir.
I have a photo of it.
I need a physical ID, unless you guys are okay with that.
This is actually my fault because I lost my drugs license a few days ago.
I don't know where it is.
It's in a bookshelf.
It's on my bookshelf.
It's okay.
You guys are okay with that?
Okay.
Just go ahead and place all your items here in the bin for me.
Okay.
Okay, now do you want to let you know you were entering the federal facility?
Okay, we are conducting.
Sir, one second.
Okay, listen to me.
I'm not done with this inspection, okay?
Okay.
We are inspecting for weapons and explosives.
You have nothing like that on you?
No, I don't.
You can still carry any tools, knives, pepper spray, nothing like that?
Okay.
Let's do your belt off.
Oh, great.
Okay.
I'm going to have you take off your coat.
Sure.
Sure.
No problem.
You guys, what are you doing?
Do you have any electronics?
Okay.
No, they're all in here.
Okay, put them separately, boss.
Separately from your bag.
Okay.
You can put them right here with your document.
Put your document here.
Put your document right there, okay?
Okay.
I'll leave them in the bag.
You want to take them out of there?
Take them out of there.
Okay.
I brought some stuff.
He said don't bring anything.
I thought you marked it.
I thought you were just being polite.
I brought a little stuff for you.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And nothing else on you?
Nope.
Okay.
Just go ahead and...
Oh, wait.
I don't mean anything.
Yeah, everything out of your pocket.
Okay?
Okay.
So you have nothing with your name on it?
I do.
Okay.
But I'll show it to you on my phone.
I'm going to have my wallet full of cards.
Oh, okay.
Just hang on to it for now, okay?
That's fine.
Stand right over there, okay?
Give me one second.
One second.
I didn't know how to play dirty support.
Okay.
Go ahead and walk through, sir.
Straight through, okay?
Okay.
There we go.
Okay.
You said you have a picture of your ID or something like that?
Yes, I do.
Okay.
I'm going to give you...
Just my recessions.
I want to see that because they can make you a badge.
Of course, sir.
Here's my phone.
Okay.
Give it to the receptionist.
Oh, wait.
They're going to want my phone.
Okay.
Give it to the receptionist.
Okay.
Give it to the receptionist.
Oh, wait.
They're going to want my phone.
Okay.
Okay.
Give it to the receptionist.
Oh, wait.
They're going to want my phone.
Okay.
Okay.
What are the rules for the mask?
Keep it on.
All times?
Sure.
Okay.
Okay.
Ma'am, thank you for following me.
It's much, much, much easier than it was last time I was here.
Sorry?
This is me.
It's new, huh?
Yeah.
That's why.
This used to be called a coffee.
Oh, yeah.
And there's a guy selling coffee over here, too.
Right?
Yeah.
If that doesn't, I'm not going to go.
Anyway.
Yeah, okay.
Is there still coffee inside?
No.
Oh, do you need coffee?
I'm going to get some coffee.
Yeah.
I don't have to go through all this again, do I?
No.
Okay.
You guys want anything?
Oh, I'm good.
Okay.
No?
Okay.
Um, coffee.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Just, you know.
Do you need it on your bag?
I like that.
Yeah.
It's a gift from Marie.
Oh, cool.
Yeah.
She's a good friend.
Yeah.
She's a good friend.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's, uh – she's learning.
She's very jealous.
Really wanting to come and hang out with you guys.
Oh, yeah.
She's so married.
She's like, but I speak eight languages.
You know?
Eight.
Which languages?
Oh, uh, uh, English, I know, right?
English, Swiss, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian.
Huh?
And I think she – uh, Chinese.
I apologize, I think because of like Chinese pandemic stuff, usually they're coming here.
Oh, oh really? In the break room upstairs to the floor?
Yeah, you know what there is.
Oh, perfect, okay.
Good morning gentlemen.
Good morning. We have a visitor here, and he's from...
Thank you.
Cheers.
Can you see my partner?
Thanks.
You guys want to do this again?
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Cool.
Does everyone make fun?
Um...
Really, huh?
Yeah, usually you'll feel comfortable here because of your game console.
Oh, dang it.
You know, I get to meet about a fun man or two different people.
I remember this tent floor.
I handed my stuff, we go to another one over there.
Exactly, same thing.
And then what we just handled over there used to be handled on a tent floor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that girl's no longer working here?
It's a floor lady?
Oh, it's always changing.
She's so nice.
Super nice.
Oh, that could be it.
Yeah.
Still not.
Are you guys there?
So, some of you are special agents?
Yep.
And you are DC3?
Uh, I'm not...
I'm not...
You know, I'm not part of their...
Oh, no.
Their hierarchy.
No, I'm not.
It's not the...
It's the general hierarchy.
In New York.
It's everything but Russia.
DC3.
Yeah, so it usually doesn't work in the same way.
Oh.
Yeah.
So different...
Different to a lot of different things.
Cool.
Oh, there.
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
You remember that?
I do.
Oh, wait.
It's my natural that's supposed to...
Oh, right.
Thanks.
Okay.
What's going to do with it?
I wonder if we're all thoroughly...
What's going on?
Did you get a chance to...
There were four lights.
Clever.
I liked it.
I liked it.
I'd love you to get the reference.
Oh, I got it.
I got it.
That's what it is.
That's supposed to make a random number.
Yeah, that's good.
One, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.
I was surprised you spelled out four, though.
Oh, I think...
Because I never thought we'd take anything.
Oh, it was?
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's how it is.
It's good.
Well, you read the call of Winston.
It's from Winston.
And he's being tortured.
Right.
Writing in the floor.
It's a portless floor.
A two-plus-two-plus-four.
Interesting.
No.
That's the one where there are five lights.
And he makes cards saying that there are four.
Oh, no.
He makes them say that there are five lights.
I know, but that's...
But it's taken from 1984?
Yes.
Right after the record.
Right after the record.
Nice.
Cool.
He probably grabbed all the stuff.
Okay.
Is there another room?
Yeah.
I think I might have a bigger...
No, it's okay.
I like the other side of the room.
Sorry, this side.
That's a big one.
It's gonna be good.
Hang on there.
I don't...
Cool.
Well, this is...
This is Thailand.
Thailand?
How do you do it?
Nice to meet you.
Can I take a hand?
Yeah, I know, it's a...
The virtual way, right?
Sure, sure.
Patty, are you from Houston as well?
No.
LA?
It's from LA.
Okay.
Do you like your coffee?
Lots of milk sugar.
Milk sugar?
Yes, please.
Can I take off my mask?
Good.
We casual here?
Okay.
I have one.
Take it really.
I just can't get the frogs up my glasses.
Yeah.
You do it with your fogger.
I know.
You know?
I've got some people with a mask.
Oh, yeah.
I've got a clear one.
Yeah, like a face shield.
Yeah.
But now they're saying,
oh, are you in the mask?
Yeah, I think so.
Right, right.
It's very, really.
Do you need both of them?
I don't know.
There are some.
There are some.
Yeah, that's a lot.
I can't wait for the last time.
I'm just gonna leave this.
Believe it or not,
Russia just did the other vaccine yesterday.
Of course they did.
I saw that.
I saw that too, right?
It's propaganda.
It's propaganda.
Oh, I'm sure.
I saw that too.
Thank you.
Good to care.
So I'm so excited to hear what this is about.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't think I can take it anymore.
It's like so thrilling.
I've got four guesses.
Can I guess?
Sure, you can guess it.
Okay.
Does it have to do...
I don't think it has to do with things.
It probably doesn't have to tell you.
It doesn't make you feel like that.
No, I'm just gonna double.
All right, let me see if I can read you.
Based on my guesses.
I don't think it's related to banking.
Okay.
Okay.
I think it's related to hacking.
Okay.
I think it has something to do with Emma.
Okay.
How am I?
I'm close?
I couldn't read you.
Well, no, you're getting a different one the first time.
Your eyes went to the right.
Usually, eyes up to the right,
you're creating something.
Down to the left, it acts as a memory.
So, everything I've read and studied about that
is actually co-pulsion.
It is co-pulsion.
You've got to know the person who does that.
It is true.
You've got to get a baseline with the person first.
Whatever.
It's not like global.
Because you think about it,
if that was true.
Yeah.
Every co-returnment,
you'd be able to find out immediately
who's blocking the business.
That's true.
That's true.
Because detection of deception
is incredibly difficult, unfortunately.
Well, do you think so?
I think it's pretty easy.
It's a research issue.
If you know how you are deceptive,
then you will know how someone else is deceptive.
Except for certain type.
I would have to see.
Lisa?
So, there's different types of liars, too.
There's Machiavellian liars,
who will lie just a lot.
They'll lie because that's just what they did
every single day of their life.
Trump.
Then, on the other side of the world,
there's what you can call the Catholic school
boy or girl.
They've grown up with a fear of lying,
where anytime they lie,
they're like,
I just said that my name is David.
What does he think my name is?
The shame associated with guilt.
So, those are, yeah, exactly.
So, those are two very distinctly different types of liars
who lie very distinctly different.
So, for example, the Machiavellian liars
is harder to detect on the line.
Because it's constant lines.
There's no baseline.
And the opposite would be the Catholic school boy or girl
is harder to detect because they're constantly triggering.
Well, they honestly think that they're lying about something
even when they're not.
What about the sort of desperate liars
that are trying to stay alive?
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot.
That's what it means.
I've read a couple books on it,
and we've taken a couple classes.
Yeah, that's what I was curious about in your classes.
Do they teach that?
Do they teach a chronicle or something?
Like, that's a thing that I'm sure
can be used to see someone's life
and there are things that we'll do.
And there's things that I do
as part of my normal daily life.
Yeah.
Well, what I do is I ask you questions.
I know you'll post your name
when it's your birthday,
because they're at low.
No.
And then I'll see how you react to the honest question.
And then I'll ask you something I know you don't know,
and I'll see how you react to that.
And that's how I establish a baseline.
That's my method, though.
That's a good thing.
That's how I do it.
What about you?
You have polygraph, huh?
What's a polygraph?
No, no, I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm never taking polygraph.
I would like to if you guys weren't helping out.
It'd be fun.
But no, I just, you know,
I like people.
Well, actually, I hate people, but I like...
I love and I hate people,
but I like to study things.
I don't know.
Very cool.
Very cool.
That was nice of you,
we're going to bring you down here.
Yeah.
I guess you can call me
if you want to head back out or something.
I'm sorry?
Do you have to give her a call?
No, it's just got to work at one.
So she said,
is you going to go out
and just to write this letter
into the judge?
Yeah.
Well, he got screwed over by his fucking lawyer.
It's got to be Mike Kretzmer.
Mm-hmm.
He went so far as to...
He emailed Jim and Tammy
saying,
I am Val's counsel.
I am Val's attorney.
I'm Val's attorney.
I'm Val's attorney.
Interesting.
Yeah, because I saw your text this morning.
I saw that.
You know, he said he'd like to represent you,
but he's not, so...
Yeah, we had to fire him.
Yeah.
He was very condescending.
And there's something really wrong.
You see, I thought it was in L.A.
I mean, it's like a mafia.
They know each other
and they do whatever
the other person says.
It's very disturbing.
They want to mess it up however you want,
but you have to have it.
That's perfect.
Thank you.
Wonderful.
All right.
Well, I tried to guess what this is all about.
It says,
nothing to do with banking.
Okay.
And I think that's something to do with hacking.
And the name is Emma.
Oh, look.
I think I got the honor of being here.
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
Well, I mean, to the third guest.
Okay.
No, no, no.
Another guest.
Interesting.
Who's the third guest?
I think he's the fourth guest.
No, no, no.
Okay.
Yes.
Oh, there's a guest.
It's a match.
It's a match.
It's a problem.
Cool.
I guess, so,
what we're here for is mainly to see
how we can help you, right?
Because we need to find out.
So, you and I have talked,
I've talked with Patty and Bowling
about it lately,
but you should probably
re-match a little bit about
what the situation is right now,
how the hearing went,
and everything else.
Just make sure that we're all on the same page.
Because like I told you,
like, if we are going to be able to help,
we have to know how we can help
and how best to help you.
Okay.
That way, we can go forward.
But at the same time,
if you're going to help us,
you also have to know,
okay, well, is this going to be
dependent on something else?
Right.
Well, that's why,
why don't you just tell me
first what you want.
And then I'll go from there.
Well, I mean,
the thing is like,
I'm not going to tell you
what exactly we want.
I'm telling you that right now.
I've already told you,
on the phone,
I'm giving you my word,
because you, Tim and Jami,
recommended you.
I said,
I'll help you if you need my help.
No matter what.
Even if it's,
even if it's not anything related
to you helping me,
I will help you the best
in my ability.
Okay.
Just because of Tim and Jami,
because I date,
their word is very,
they carry a lot with me.
It goes far with me.
So I've already told you that,
so I'll stick with that.
You don't have to worry about
anything too transactional with me
right now.
Okay.
If you guys are coming out here
to help me,
that's great.
Okay.
I'll tell you,
what do you need to know?
The whole story from the beginning?
Yep.
Different deal.
Okay.
Go.
Um.
Um.
I don't even know where to start
from the beginning.
Uh.
Okay.
So,
you don't know my story though.
It doesn't really matter, does it?
Um.
You can't even trust it.
You can't even trust it.
Oh, please don't read it.
David Ennerinches article.
It's terrible.
Um.
Okay.
So Marie and I,
I'm that,
you know,
you can't even trust it.
You can't even trust it.
You can't even trust it.
You can't even trust it.
Marie and I met,
uh,
because I thought she was a spy for my mom,
and I thought she was spying on me.
So I,
uh,
confronted her,
and she was,
uh,
had a show in Australia
doing,
selling a bunch of,
uh,
she had a personal,
like her first cool show in Adeline,
I think,
with her,
Sydney.
I don't remember.
So,
um,
she ends up,
she knows my mother,
because my mother,
um,
she know that story, right?
So he killed himself,
and my mother needs something to do,
after she,
uh,
robbed me and everyone else in the family
of all our money.
Um,
went to,
back to,
uh, art school in New York,
and,
uh,
Marie was just about to leave her husband,
and she went to art school in New York at the same time.
So my mom's like 64,
Marie was like 34 at the same time,
but they hit it off,
became friends.
You know,
Marie actually stayed on my mom's house,
she knows my sisters,
she did like cocaine with my mother,
which is weird.
You could imagine,
with stories,
it's very weird.
Um,
anyway,
so,
and not to incriminate me.
It's a joke,
you guys say.
Having coffee with friends.
Right, right.
So,
um,
and then we hit it off,
and she came back to LA,
and she lived in LA fortunately,
and,
uh,
and David needed somebody to,
um,
and my mother's side was not talking,
and at this point,
I was still friends with David,
David Unridge,
and he is someone on my mom's count,
and so I said,
you know what,
I think I got the perfect person,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna flip her,
and take her from my mom's side,
bring her to our side,
it's a good side of the force,
right,
and I did,
you know,
and I did,
and she became a source of the book,
and she told David
all the blanks he,
uh,
was missing,
and we moved in together,
you know,
all my life,
I've been like a bachelor,
you know,
kind of spoiled brat,
mostly too,
and my dad,
kind of financed my life,
so I,
I made music,
I had 36 albums in a single,
I had a lot of girlfriends,
I fucked around,
I went on tour,
I had fun,
you know,
and that all,
went to zero,
and it all stopped,
immediately,
and January 26, 2014,
and I learned,
I learned a lot since then,
a lot of things have changed for me,
and I've never dated a girl
with a kid,
and I was like,
you know what,
I really love her,
and I really like this kid,
so why the fuck not?
I mean,
my father,
my mom,
when I was a kid,
you know,
and,
he's a good kid,
and it's not that,
I mean,
it's hard to raise a kid,
believe me,
but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was,
you know,
especially when he's a good kid,
you know,
he's really happy,
but, you know,
and like,
most of that's really from me.
They say it's a much stronger love.
That you'll ever love,
yeah,
it's true,
it's true,
but I also have like,
I'm also not,
I mean,
I'm like the boyfriend,
so I mean,
I'm the father figure,
as well,
but I guess I don't have the burden
that Marie has,
and that's,
like I could see hers,
she is really upset
over little things all the time.
I'm like,
why are you getting so upset?
She'll fuck you.
Anyway,
we,
we,
everything was sort of going fine.
I got a bit depressed
when Peggy died,
a very close friend of mine
died January 1st.
And now,
Is it?
No,
it's 2019,
you know,
but,
that's another story.
It's a good story,
but a long story.
Neil Young,
his wife,
Peggy,
Neil Young is a real dick,
a real fucking asshole.
When I was at the funeral,
he stood up there on stage,
it looked like he had won,
like Peggy had died,
and he got his girl,
his daughter back,
who was,
he was,
this,
this strange from,
and all the money that Peggy took in divorce,
and he said,
there's like,
I won,
I got it all back.
I had to leave early,
I don't know,
about what I said.
The point of that story is
because you need to know
that Steve,
so Steve Tolst,
okay,
he's an Australian,
and he is a writer.
He won like a second prize
in a beauty contest,
you know,
like a runner-up
for the Booker Prize,
but not even
when the Booker Prize,
and he only did it
because his father
is a very well-placed guy
in Sydney,
and a very wealthy family
of lawyers,
and they did
whatever they could.
So,
he's sort of like,
and I don't say
it's just a little bit
of the angry boyfriend,
he's kind of,
he's running the capacity,
he's running sort of like,
he's not the brightest guy around,
but he can fool you
into believing he is,
you know,
and I think he did that
to Marie for a long time,
and when she sort of caught on
what was really happening,
she left.
But,
when I met her,
he was still emailing her
20, 30 times a day,
texting her,
sorry,
the equivalent,
and she thought she
had to respond,
and I remember
being in a car in like,
2018,
I'm like,
why are you responding to this?
Why are you doing this?
Like, every time you have
an issue where you have to
say, oh, you're going to be fine,
she's like,
I don't know,
I just feel guilty if I don't.
I'm like,
well, okay,
we don't have to,
and then she was
like, you're right,
I don't,
and then she stopped,
and that's when it all started.
So,
he's a kind of guy,
I was telling Kim,
would rather burn
the world down
than to
allow her to leave him.
Okay,
and I never met these
attached people before.
This is new to me,
right?
Like,
first of all,
I'm dating a girl with a kid,
and now there's a boyfriend,
like,
the kind you see in
freaking television shows,
you know,
it exists.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
I thought she was like,
I thought Marie was over exaggerating.
I'm like,
come on,
can't it be that offensive?
She shows me the best.
I'm like,
wow,
you know,
you have to really be crazy.
So again,
the reason,
what you don't know,
is that when they first met,
it was sort of normal.
She was waiting for him to leave,
but he stayed
and moved into her house.
Then he got sick,
and aneurysm in his back.
It did something to the spinal nerve,
and L4,
I don't know,
I'm not out of position,
so I don't know exactly,
but it severed the nerve,
pinched the nerve.
It was something where it paralyzed.
Neck down,
fully paralyzed.
She,
Marie is such the type where,
she actually wrote a letter to
Sarkozy saying,
I need your help,
is that Australian,
and he even paid for his medical bills.
And Sarkozy fucking responded,
and said,
okay.
Yeah,
that's Marie.
So Sarkozy actually paid for his bills?
Sarkozy paid for his bills.
Probably started to write
Sarkozy for health and planning.
Right?
Yeah,
what am I doing here
when I talk to Sarkozy?
No.
But
what's really weird
is that Steve's father
could have paid for it,
but they didn't,
because they were that type of people.
They can get it for free,
then they'll take it, right?
It doesn't matter that they're taking someone else's
scholarship,
someone else's
fund for their thing,
they don't care.
So Marie nursed him back to health
after a couple years,
and he could walk with him.
Miracle,
it was a 4% chance of walking,
you walk.
Oh no,
sorry,
not 4% chance.
That was,
that was having M-[Redacted]'s 4% chance.
It was like a very low
percent chance of walking,
but he was up and walking.
But
he would forever have to wear a catheter.
I think it costs me back,
I'm not sure how long that lasted,
but of course,
the guy,
no hard on,
cannot get it up,
no sex.
So Marie
just was in her,
she's very loyal,
and she was 22,
and she met him,
very young and naive.
So,
what am I doing?
I guess,
can't,
you know,
I have to stick with this guy.
You know,
she did last as long as she could,
and his mind
and body deteriorated further and further,
and then she just left.
She couldn't take it much,
she left.
Now,
between us,
they separated in,
I think 2013,
but for the lawyers,
it's 2018.
Just so you know,
because she's,
you know,
for the,
you know,
I don't know any about divorce either,
but the lawyer said,
let's just say 2018.
Okay,
so I don't know.
So,
when,
I met him for the first time,
he seemed,
I mean,
I was like,
oh, hello,
my name's Val,
I'm the guy that's fucking your wife.
He's like,
ah, ha, ha,
very funny.
It was a joke,
and he laughed,
and he took it well.
He did?
Yeah.
He took a chance.
I did,
I did.
Everyone else laughs,
you know,
but,
he became more obsessive.
The text increased
tremendously.
I mean,
we're talking like 50 to 60,
answering me,
what are you doing?
I don't understand.
And they were like,
really negative.
It's all designed to make her hurt,
feel like shit,
feel guilty,
you know,
or feel sorry for him.
Every single one is designed for that.
I printed them all out,
gave them to the lawyer.
It's,
just to read them,
it's like weird.
You guys,
it's a fun read,
if you ever want to,
if you're bored.
I'll send it to you if you want.
But it's disturbing,
too,
because it's a sign of obsession,
and that's never going to end well,
you know.
So,
fast forward to a bunch of stuff,
on April 10th,
or,
sorry,
before April 10th,
COVID hit,
and Marla had to be
taught home,
homeschooled now,
so he had the logins
to the computer,
you know,
such a nightmare at first.
It was such a nightmare.
Oh, man, yeah.
Trying to get him to do homework,
and he's lying,
now he's lying all the time.
And this kid,
he never lied.
He like,
was so honest and happy,
he couldn't put him anywhere,
and he would start talking to everybody,
and everyone would be
in trance by his conversation.
He is a smart kid,
he's so smart.
But now,
he's lying.
I mean,
why is he lying?
Is he trying to hide something?
He's depressed,
he's something's wrong,
he doesn't either,
but Marie always blames Steve,
no matter what,
it's always Steve.
And I kind of learned
that she's,
you know,
almost always right too,
you know,
because he comes,
it's a 50-50 custody at this point.
Sorry,
for a year,
it was 50-50 custody.
Before that,
it was 80-20,
Marie, okay?
But for the last year,
they tried 50-50.
Steve says,
and I have a lot of records,
saying I cannot take care
of Marla for more than a week
at a time.
All he does
is he sits in the little office,
and he writes the books.
He works for screenwriting
for some comedy TV show,
it's not very funny.
Two police officers
are detectives in a car
the whole time.
Security?
Something security?
I don't know.
It's not that good.
It's not that good.
So that's why he's in the country.
Not Tim and Jamie.
I needed,
Marie wanted to divorce him,
she's been wanting him
for so long,
but she can't,
because,
but because of the visa
that she was on,
she was tied to it,
she could not work in America,
and she was trying to do,
you know,
she would still
do some cash jobs,
or she'd teach French,
or art,
to the mothers,
to go to a school called Lila,
it's a French,
for French people.
And there's something
we were going on about that
school too,
you guys should be aware of.
Very,
something's off.
But,
what was I saying?
Sorry,
you know that Lila,
French school,
and it brought up,
80, 20, 50, 50.
Yeah, the custody,
that's right.
Yeah.
And then COVID.
That's right.
Yeah, she's,
well, now Marie works in rehab.
She works at arts,
which is another crazy thing
about DCFS.
She works in rehab,
which is randomly drug tested
every week, right?
So,
but I'll get to that.
She teaches art therapy
to all these drug addicts.
She's able to work,
and Marla's able to work,
and everything's going fine,
and then Steve,
one day, comes over,
because we're a day late,
or there was some misinterpretation,
and this,
something happened,
someone didn't communicate
with someone about Marla,
one who was supposed to be picked up.
Steve knows to never come
by place, or loft.
He knows to never come by,
and we don't go to his place either.
It's an unspoken rule.
He comes over,
and he,
he's wearing a mask
that was white,
but he drew,
and this was really weird,
I thought, he drew teeth.
He's a 50 year old man,
okay, and he drew teeth
on the mask.
He came over,
and I had a security camera,
so I had the whole thing on tape.
It was wonderful,
this is fucking hilarious.
But,
he goes,
he comes over,
and you know,
you see pedestrians throw by,
and they're just normal people,
when you can see someone going for a run,
and someone just walking the dog,
but then you see a slow,
perambling,
what the hell is this?
And it's, of course, Steve.
I mean, I don't know if he's high,
I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy.
But he makes it to the front door,
he knocks,
he blows up his one sleeve,
he's preparing for something, obviously.
And,
no, I don't,
I don't really see this in retrospect.
At the time,
I'm upstairs having a joke
and laughing with Marla and Marie.
Like, we're like on the floor laughing
about word Al Jankiewicz,
because Yoda,
you know what I'm saying, Yoda?
Why Yoda?
Yoda is great.
But Marla just learned it,
so he was laughing.
And then the door is,
someone's knocking the door,
and it's around five o'clock, I remember,
because that's when Steve's always on time,
perfectly.
And I'm like,
what the fuck?
So I said,
I'll go check,
and I open the door,
and I see Steve,
and Steve goes,
Marla,
Marla,
he starts screaming for Marla.
Marie is so freaked out,
she takes Marla,
and she hides in the bathroom.
It's the only door in the loft as a lock,
and it's like,
just the furthest,
it's the furthest from the front door,
actually, too.
And I was like,
wow,
like she really,
she was fucking scared.
And I don't want her scared,
it's just like a little,
you know,
puny guy can barely walk,
so I,
but he starts,
he says,
I want him to,
I'm here to pick up Marla,
and I say,
no, you're not,
you cannot be here,
you're not supposed to be here.
What are you doing here?
You gotta go.
No, I'm picking up Marla,
it's five o'clock,
look, just,
let me put on some shoes,
and some socks,
and a jacket,
and I was,
I wasn't fully dressed,
I was like,
sweatpants,
and shirt.
Let me come outside,
and I'll,
and I'll talk to you about it.
He said,
well,
there's not much to talk about,
but okay,
so he goes back,
I close the door,
and now,
what I learned later,
is when I closed the door,
he whipped out his cell phone,
and he opened up an app,
and he starts flipping through porn.
Normal, right?
No, not,
very odd behavior.
I was like,
what the fuck,
but it wasn't like porn porn,
it was like dating site porn,
with the couples.
It was fucking weird,
right?
To come over to the house,
not gonna be angry at me,
because he was kind of like,
his voice was raised,
I'm telling you,
like a really brief version,
but then just like,
not chill out,
like,
it was very strange.
I tell him,
look, it's okay,
I'm gonna handle it,
and Marla says,
you know what,
my dad,
he just needs to be reassured,
and Marla's like,
no, no, no,
no reassuring,
just stay here with me in the bathtub,
and like,
you guys are just gonna be fine,
I'm just gonna talk to him,
and you'll leave.
So I get dressed,
I open the door,
and the door opens up this way,
and then as my door,
as the door's open,
he comes in,
shoulder,
right here,
to break my,
my,
my grip,
on the door,
but I,
he's not that strong,
so I,
he doesn't break my grip,
he just makes me upset,
so I grab,
and I pull him out,
and he doesn't quite hit the car,
his first reaction is,
oh, my back,
right,
like a,
sort of like a,
childish thing,
very strange,
for a 50-year-old man,
and I said,
oh, shut the fuck up,
and now you can hear me,
the profanity's out,
I'm like,
are you stupid,
are you that stupid,
I mean,
to fight a,
you know,
and I said,
this is California,
this is,
you know,
good thing I'm not like California,
because,
you know,
they carry guns,
like,
people can have guns,
I don't even have a gun,
you know,
things like this,
and then he,
he,
I said,
look,
this is on camera,
then he's like,
you just lost,
you just lost the divorce,
you just lost everything,
you fucked up man,
you gotta go now,
he's like,
I'm not leaving,
so,
short version is,
I throw him out to the sidewalk,
I push him until he's in the,
it's still private property,
but I just sort of say,
now you're in the streets,
you can leave us alone though,
and I tell you,
I will,
and I made him a promise,
I will bring Marlo out,
you can say hello to Marlo,
I will bring him out,
and you have my word on that,
but you have to be by your car,
you cannot be on our property,
and you can agree to do it,
go to his car,
so Marlo,
please do me a favor,
can you come out with me,
but just don't let go of my hand,
and Marlo says,
okay,
and he does not let go of my hand
all the time,
because I know he's gonna try and steal him,
and he tried twice,
the whole time,
I recorded everything on my phone,
it's all,
it's all there,
and the video camera,
so when that incident occurred,
Marie and I sat down and talked,
and she said,
the deterioration has gone severe,
this is a line that's crossed,
and Marie's in the middle of the forest,
and to cross this line,
in the middle of the forest,
is very stupid,
okay,
so that means the brain has deteriorated
further than we even imagined,
so Marie is very concerned,
and she's like,
I'm not giving Marlo back down,
so she holds on to Marlo
for the last five months,
so we had Marlo,
and we were like,
it's fun to have like,
now we're like a family,
for five months,
we found Marlo,
you know,
we all got to know each other,
and Marlo,
you know,
it's really funny,
it was nice.
How long have you been living with Marlo?
Two and a half years now,
but you know,
you see Marlo every other week.
Like five months?
Yeah, yeah,
it was a lot at first,
especially for me,
but I got used to it,
it wasn't,
it wasn't so,
you know,
I thought it was going to be even worse for me,
but you know,
expect the worst.
It's a good day,
it could go any way.
Yeah, it's true, it's true,
but you know,
and we'd see Steven,
and the fear,
see the fear and the lying,
and we'd try to teach him to not lie,
like he starts lying,
like he talks,
I said,
Marlo,
why are these lies?
And we know where they come from,
because Steve,
this is how Steve talks,
he lies constantly,
he's always,
he's always,
and we felt like we made some progress,
you know,
he was,
he had more self-confidence,
like he was afraid of dancing,
and eight year old,
afraid of dancing,
because he's self-conscious,
he's fucking silly,
so we started dancing more
to make him less self-conscious,
and we did these kung fu outfits,
so we pretended we were kung fu fighting,
you know,
saw him kung fu fighting,
he loves it,
so his confidence is back,
he's happy,
and he fucking said to me,
three days before this,
all went to shit,
he said,
well,
I wish you were my father,
he said to me,
and it broke my heart,
it broke my heart,
I mean,
I felt great and warm,
but it also broke my heart,
you know,
and I know that feeling,
because I grew up in foster care,
you know,
I know that feeling,
I've been to two different,
different families,
and different mothers,
and different fathers,
I had two brothers once in foster care,
you know,
you know, home.
You remember it pretty well?
Yeah, yeah,
and one I don't,
two I remember pretty well,
the last one I remember very well,
because there was,
there wasn't the horrible system
that you hear about,
this is a nice happy Jewish family,
a loving family,
they're like good people,
you know,
even in Chicago,
in Cook County,
Carol and Larry Payless,
I remember,
it's not like the shoe store,
it's Payless,
I said,
oh,
sometimes for a different climate,
it's a lot like a craft shoe,
I see.
Yeah,
I got lucky,
I got lucky,
because I heard the stories,
you know,
so,
it's still,
it's still in the middle, yeah.
No, nothing,
there's fighting,
and Steve is using this now,
as a tool in the divorce,
everything that just happened is,
weaponizing DCFS,
he just did it,
and it forgot it limited capacity,
I know that it wasn't him,
it's gotta be the lawyers,
his lawyers are pretty smart,
because he's got money,
he's got like seven lawyers,
you know,
you have one guy
that barely leaves his office,
we do most of the work,
Marie and I.
Anyway,
so Marie and I are like,
we've gone through two cleaning ladies,
one live in the brewery,
and one girl,
she's great,
she was like too cute for me,
because,
why is she doing it?
Marie,
why is she doing it?
I'm not staring at her,
why does she have to worry
about these tight pants?
I'm like,
no, I didn't ask her,
it's not my fault,
and then one day,
she's like,
you know what,
I don't want to clean,
I want to sing,
I want to make music,
I'm like, okay,
go make some music,
so she quit,
so we start cleaning,
and in Richard,
you know,
Marla gets in trouble,
we're like,
oh,
you gotta do the dishes,
you know,
you have to wipe and clean,
and he doesn't like that either,
so we thought,
why not do,
get a nanny slash,
a housekeeper,
okay,
somebody can do both,
watch Marla,
we can have some time alone,
and they can clean the fucking house.
So we do put the feelers out,
Marie puts them out
on some next door,
it's a couple other websites.
I ask everybody,
I know,
oh,
sorry,
I forgot,
I almost forgot Patel.
Patel is a labor,
one,
two,
three,
three doors down,
four doors down,
I thought she'd just moved in,
in like July,
or sorry,
mid June,
I'd never seen her before,
but all of a sudden,
she's there,
everywhere,
very loud and boisterous,
and she,
outside,
look,
at our place,
there's a little park
across the way,
and Marla always hangs out there,
and so everyone,
sort of,
the brewery,
the brewery,
artist loft,
it's like an artist community,
so it's a campus,
more or less,
and it's just 300 lofts,
with a whole bunch of it,
with six or 900 people in it,
it's a different spot,
so everyone hangs out
in the sort of park areas,
where we are,
because it's closest to us.
She says,
she saw him in the park,
and she showed him his jewelry,
and he said,
oh, I want to make this,
just some jewelry,
and I was like,
you want to make crystal jewelry?
He's like,
yes,
I want to make crystal jewelry.
Like, okay, Marla,
you can make some crystal jewelry.
So we take him over there,
and she seems sane, right?
I know something's off,
you know,
I mean,
I can sense it,
I know something's wrong,
but I figure maybe this is like,
she's in a,
just got her parents' house,
or she's moving,
trying to make her life,
or start a new world.
I mean,
there's no way she's making money
selling crystal jewelry, okay?
It's,
first of all,
it's shitty jewelry,
no one's buying it,
and it's way too expensive.
It's not $4,500 a month,
on that place.
I know what she's paying too.
So,
I figure there's some parents
paying for it,
or something,
or maybe a brother,
definitely not a sugar daddy type,
because she's the most unattractive
woman I've ever seen.
Like,
you see her,
and you're like,
whoa,
okay,
and it's unfortunate for her,
but it is true.
So,
anyway,
she,
we brought her over,
and we approved
for like two hours a day.
We thought that couldn't be,
literally,
you can walk in 10 seconds
and get to her house,
or something.
It's like,
there's no danger,
you know?
And Miles said,
please, please,
can I have that crystal jewelry, please?
Okay,
yes,
and we get two hours to ourselves now.
So,
we're happy.
So,
for five days,
and he makes crystal jewelry.
He comes back for lunch.
He eats with us.
Sometimes,
Marie brings them lunch.
Sometimes,
I'll go over there
and just see what's going on.
Everything's friendly and copicetic.
You can always,
she's no problem.
She's a talker.
She likes to jab her
about herself.
She will not ask you anything
about how you are,
where you're from,
or anything.
She'll just tell you everything
she knows about everybody.
Gossip,
gossip, gossip.
People live like that.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's,
well,
it's because that's what she thinks
her value is,
and that's why we're,
you know,
it's very,
I understand it,
but,
but I mentioned,
Marlo,
like,
making crafts.
Anything,
and we found someone,
like,
I'll talk to him, too.
And that was like,
you know,
it was so,
it was interesting,
but he loved it.
And he even said,
down,
down Marlo,
bye,
have you liked my whole life?
I've already made crystal jewelry.
Your whole life,
figures on.
He's like,
it's a huge revelation,
yeah.
All right, Marlo,
you go for it.
Of course,
he got bored with it,
you know,
four days later.
But on Saturday,
Patil decided to sell the jewelry
that she had been making with Marlo.
So,
they go and they set up
a thing in the park,
like,
just a table,
and all the people from
the community come over
and they see Marlo,
and he's fucking adorable,
selling jewelry,
so people buy jewelry.
Of course,
I buy most of it,
you know,
so,
and I have to buy some Patil's jewelry, too,
because it looks bad,
but she's not really selling any.
So,
I buy some of her,
so I spend like 250 bucks
on this useless jewelry
that's already broken,
right?
Um,
Steve is $250.
I don't know.
No,
no,
I've not,
but it's like 30 pieces,
you know,
it's ridiculous.
Yeah,
you don't need it,
trust me.
It's not necessary.
But,
but Steve,
I invite Steve,
because I'm a nice guy.
So,
I'm like,
Steve would like to see this.
His son is making money
on something he created
on his own.
He's better than with his first $20.
So,
he's ever earned.
Steve would like to see this.
I think it would be a good idea.
And Marie's like,
no.
I say,
come on,
let him,
he's got to,
he'll enjoy this.
Because we give him visits every week
or whenever he wants to,
well,
not whenever,
basically once a week,
but whenever he wants to talk tomorrow,
we let him talk,
unless tomorrow does not want to talk
and not as often.
And he does not want to accept that.
Um,
so,
I invite him over
and he comes over
and,
um,
and,
oh, shit.
Um,
I forgot I'm working today too,
but it's okay.
I put on an option
because I don't have to worry about it
till next week.
Um,
so,
he comes over
and he's
instantly in the mood changes.
You'll,
if you ever meet him,
you'll see for yourself.
You know,
it's one of those people,
everything's sort of down,
now I'm depressing
and self-conscious.
You know,
because that's what he,
that's what he emulates.
Um,
he seems somewhat immune
to it right now,
but he won't be in the future.
I know it.
I could see it happen.
Um,
he asked Patille
for her number.
Steve.
Steve does.
Which I thought was strange.
Um,
but not too strange.
Marie said
he never asked people
for her number.
This is not a good idea.
Okay.
And I said,
well,
I'll trust you.
Um,
later that night,
Patille,
uh,
Marie and I are,
uh, walking.
For some reason,
we didn't walk to the,
now we weren't doing the laundry,
we had to walk past the park.
I can't remember why.
Um,
and we see Patille
and three other girls
sitting in the park
by candlelight talking.
And I go,
hey,
nice to see you guys.
We're going back,
going to bed,
cause I had to wake up early
for some reason.
Um,
I can't remember why.
I had to wake up early.
I was upset at Marie
for making me stay up so late.
You know,
I was like,
I had to,
he promised me
to get to bed before,
and I had to do extra shit
for something.
So she says,
okay,
don't worry,
let's just have a quick talk
with Patille
and talk about the day.
So,
you know,
okay,
fine.
But that quick talk with Patille
means she's going to talk
to you at you for an hour.
You know,
and of course,
I'm,
and Marielett does it,
so I'm the one that says,
okay,
enough,
I've got to go to sleep.
Right?
I'm going to have to be the asshole.
So I say,
okay, fine.
She comes into our place
for the first time.
In our entrance living room, we have a loft, there's an upstairs, back room, there's a whole bunch of fucking space.
And I'm like, okay, great, let's just go outside and smoke a cigarette and have a go.
She says, okay.
Go outside and we're underneath now my surveillance camera, okay?
And I have a 30-day fucking break point.
Marie is typing a letter now to send to LogiCircle to get this fucking tape because this will change everything.
Patille and we're smoking a cigarette and Patille goes on a tirade about how much she sees evil in Steve.
I looked in his eyes and all I saw was pure evil.
You know, like they're really dramatic.
I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.
She's like really, she gets in my face like, I don't really, I got in his eyes and I saw nothing.
It was blank. It was evil.
I said, no, Patille, what you saw was emptiness. There's just nothing in there.
He's not very smart.
She was, no, no, no, it was evil.
This was our conversation for like a good 15 minutes, right?
So not only are we confident that Patille hates Steve, you know, that she's not going to sell us out or do anything stupid.
We were like, okay, she's, you know, we believe her.
But, you know, I don't realize and I'm stupid because I forgot this is classic bipolar.
That's what I picked up on.
This woman is fucking classic bipolar.
And I've seen this so many times and I was dumb to not listen to my instinct that first day when I knew something was wrong.
I didn't know what it was.
I didn't think about it hard enough.
I think that's where I fucked up because that's what she is.
And now I see it because they flip one extreme to the next and that's exactly what happened.
Now in her report, she says she reached out to Steve via Instagram.
Not true.
They have, she's got a phone number.
Okay.
She wrote a report because we stopped seeing her after this because also there was something she was fucking dancing naked with M-[Redacted], supposedly.
M-[Redacted] says she was dancing, but she may or may or not have been naked.
So M-[Redacted] doesn't really understand.
He's going either way.
Right.
So I don't know what that means with M-[Redacted], but I don't like it.
He said he felt uncomfortable.
He tried not to look.
All he said, all I wanted to do was finish making the jewelry and she wanted to dance.
So that was enough for us to think this is enough of this.
Okay.
We put him in camp the next day.
He goes to a beach day camp for the next two weeks.
Now we don't hear from Patel for a long time.
We think something's wrong.
Why is she like say hello?
We don't see because she's not voice person friendly.
Then we get hit with Steve's lawyers.
Like a dossier.
They send like a thing saying here are the witness statements I have.
Why yours is a terrible person.
Here's why I'm great.
Not quite enough to do.
It's like an aggregate.
Yeah, summary of what she wanted and other people saying that me is a terrible person.
I want to say July 30th approximately July 30th.
So we see this and what we read is so fucking outrageously crazy.
She said that M-[Redacted] is walking around without a shirt barefoot and is combing through garbage for fucking food.
Seriously.
He's going through dumpster for food.
And he says Marie is doing the same thing.
Or sorry, she says Marie is doing the same thing.
And then she says that Marie is walking around itching and scratching with sores all over her body.
A classic junkie.
She named every single drug in the world from fucking crystal meth that PCP did.
Some exotic crazy shit.
You remember in the heart of, you know.
She says that there is a secret hidden room in her loft where all the drugs are stored in the paraphernalia.
Okay.
She says I have 40, I'm not exaggerating, 40 to 50 cell phones scattered on the tables.
Okay.
Not fucking exaggerating.
And it's even worse.
They're worse crazy shit.
But those are the ones I remember right now.
And we're like what the fuck.
You know, and immediately I think that Steve paid her.
He had to pay her.
But this is before I figured out the bipolar thing.
What is the lawyer asking for?
They want nothing.
The lawyer said nothing.
This is like a tactic.
At this point you guys are full custody.
Well, see the custody arrangement as far as I understand it.
Again, I'm not a lawyer and I've never been through it.
But since they're still married they both have equal rights to Marla.
But no one has any, there are no rules set.
So it was a verbal agreement to say 50-50 for a year.
So when Marie said no 50-50 it was perfectly legal for her to do that.
And then she felt bad and she thought well maybe I should give him to,
and also we could want it some time alone after a couple months or like,
maybe we should give him to Steve for like a month,
or sorry, for a week.
And then our lawyer said no.
Because there was no rule to stop him from keeping Marla.
You know, just as you did he can do the same.
So we're like okay, so we keep him.
So when we see this thing from Utila it just freaks us out.
Like what the fuck.
And then DCFS comes over.
And I never heard of DCFS.
I don't know what the acronym stood for.
I'm sure I was visited by them as a child.
Because it seems like I remember something.
I did have a social worker I remember.
But the first woman that came over was named Priscilla.
And she was very nice.
She came over and she, I let her in which is stupid.
And I realized now you should never let them in if they ever come to your house.
It's a thing you can take.
They can never take away a child if you don't let them in.
That's what I was told by Laura.
But she came in.
She viewed the house.
It was safe.
It was loving.
It was fun.
It was a good fucking home.
And she reported that.
Okay.
Now Marie said to her in her interview that there was an incident that she was worried about.
And I remember very well.
We came home from shopping one day.
And Marlo just starts telling us like a confession.
This crazy story about touching penises at the Mark and Bobax house.
These people that sort of turned on Marie.
They were friends of Marie.
And then some reason they were not.
They just turned and then chose Steve's side.
Because people would need divorce.
People would pick sides.
It's shitty.
People are fucking shitty.
You call someone a friend.
I mean, it really hurt her.
It really hurt her.
And the things they said were so fucking ridiculous and stupid.
Anyway, it's the...
What was the point of that?
Sorry.
I need some more coffee.
I'm talking too much about coffee.
Okay.
So what was it just before that?
Oh, DCLA.
So what comes to the house?
She says, are you willing to take drugs to us?
And we say, yes, you're willing to take drugs to us.
Great.
We don't hear back from her for about three or four days.
Actually, we've never heard back from her.
That was the last we saw at Priscilla.
Next thing we know, police are at the door.
This is actually the second time police came.
They came before Priscilla came.
And then they came.
Then Priscilla and then the police came again.
And then...
No, this is Sabah Abta.
And Erasmo...
Aguilera.
Aguilera.
Not Aguilera, but Aguilera without the A.
Those are not the police?
Those are not the police.
These are more DCFS.
DCFS?
Yeah.
And now it's 10.30 at night and they're coming knocking door at 10.30 at night.
And so, Marie's not home.
She's at Amy's.
And she's all under your camera.
She'll put it on YouTube or something like that.
And they are...
You know, first they wake up Marlon.
They're banging on the door.
And Marlon was asleep.
I was asleep.
Because I woke up fucking early to the trade options.
You know, like 6 o'clock, 6.30.
The market's open at 6.30.
I have to be awake and ready at 6.30 a.m.
So, you know, I'm half asleep.
And Marlon's like,
Someone's at the door.
Someone's at the door.
I'm like, Marlon, why aren't you asleep?
You're supposed to be asleep.
They woke me up.
They woke me up.
It's okay.
So I go out and I open the door.
And I see...
And I say, where's DCFS?
We're going to talk to you.
I'm like, I just spoke to you guys.
You were just here, you know?
And he's like, well, you got another call.
And I'm like, fucking...
And I know it's Patel calling every day.
Patel and Steve's together calling every day.
Just to fuck with us.
You see where they can get.
I know it.
You know?
And they know it too.
So I'm like, you know, I'm just sort of sick of it.
I don't really want to do this anymore.
But I talk to them.
We have a conversation.
I'm very friendly.
You know, I'm not...
I don't give them any shit.
And they just...
I don't remember legally if they...
If I invited them or they just walked in the house.
So they ended up getting in the house.
I don't remember saying, yeah, go ahead, please.
Come in for another round.
But they did.
And they did the rounds.
And we joked and we laughed.
Now, here's...
No.
This is where I...
We broke down.
Marie and I have been doing this for three days.
Like, nonstop.
Working on this thing that you guys sent.
You know, breaking every single word by word,
every line by line.
Where the lies are and what we can prove.
We have documentary evidence for it when we don't.
Right?
For example, she says, I knocked on the door
and took about ten minutes to come to the door.
It took two minutes and thirty-two seconds.
Okay?
Two minutes and thirty-two fucking seconds.
She says, we went through the house.
There was no food in the refrigerator.
It was scarce.
We had just ordered about three hundred and fifty-four hundred dollars
from Amazon delivery.
Fresh, direct.
To come fucking two guys full of...
car full of food.
It was overflowing.
We made jokes.
I joked them.
I said, look, ha!
Guess you can't say where you're going.
So we're starving him.
And we all laughed about it.
In the report, it says, scarce.
Those are just, like, too little things.
No, I'm not even getting into the big ones.
It was delivered the next day.
No, it was there.
It was already there.
The night before, we had got ordered it.
And we had packed up the fridge and the pantries.
All right?
It was like, what the fuck?
We couldn't believe what we were reading.
And if you read that thing, the first fourteen, fifteen pages are like,
okay, fine.
So it's normal.
Nothing's wrong here.
And then we become, like, the worst people you've ever heard.
It's like fucking crazy shit.
And somehow, I don't give her the number.
She has Tim's number.
How the fuck does she get Tim's number?
And she says, and there's a little note at the end,
because she's trying to discredit me as much as she can.
And you can see that it's really hard.
Worse than David Enridge did at The New York Times.
Like, really come after me.
But I don't understand.
I'm what I did to anger her.
I have a recording, because I've learned to record pretty much everything.
You know, it's smart, because no way people can fuck with you.
And another question, why?
Like, I am.
I'm joking.
I'm just going to steal it from your cloud later.
But what was I saying?
I recorded her saying, well, obviously, you know, the house is great.
Obviously, Marlo loves you and you love Marlo.
It's not, you know, you guys are great.
Just, we want you to take a drug test, and that's it.
And I'm like, okay, that's it.
I agreed.
And then I said, and then there's another phone call later,
because the next day, four police officers came.
And that's where I was just, I had enough.
I'm like, look, more fucking police officers.
Ed, this is the fourth day in a row, and you're still doing this.
At what point is this harassment?
This is like a few weeks ago.
Yeah.
Oh, this is much, what's today the 12th?
So today, yeah, we're in August now.
We're in August.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I was looking at the footage last night again.
It was July 29th.
This must be the 30th now.
30th or August 1st, right around there.
Yeah, I think so.
Because the police came the next day, so it must be the 30th.
How many days are in July?
July 31.
So it's 30th or 31st.
Yeah, yeah.
I didn't even know.
I didn't even know.
I had zero ideas when I asked.
So, yeah.
So all of this stuff that's happening,
is that what was court on, what was it, on Monday?
No, no, no.
It gets worse.
It gets worse when you get to what happens on Sunday.
So I'm like, I say, Savva, look,
and I read her this email.
I said, look, nothing personal against you.
You seem like a good person.
I just, I'm tired of everyone of you guys believing this woman
and accepting this as fact and not even investigating the caller.
Clearly, this woman is out of her mind.
And how can you not delineate saying from insane,
I think that's your job, but I didn't say it like that.
I said it very kindly.
I have a copy of it.
I supported you.
And I said, look, I'm just going to say we'll do the drug test,
but that's it.
We're going to put our foot down.
We're not going to do anything else after the drug test.
All right.
We're just going to, we're not going to, we're going to stop.
So you tell us what the next move is and we will oblige.
And that I can quote.
I mean, I said that tell us what the next move is
and we will oblige.
That's a quote, right?
And then I didn't hear from her.
And then Tuesday of that week, we interviewed a clean lady.
She came to us from, see, I still think Patel sent her this woman
because I asked Patel, do you know anyone that it will clean and babysit?
Because I feel bad that you, I don't want you to think
we're sending Marla over to your place to babysit.
Okay.
So I was trying to overcompensate by saying,
please give me the name and number of a fucking babysitter.
You know, so that way she wouldn't think that.
You know, so I still suspect it came from her,
but Marie thinks it came from somebody else.
So I don't know.
But she called us and said, I heard you're looking for a babysitter.
And I said, yes, we are, but also a cleaning lady too.
Like you need to be able to clean.
So she says, I can do that.
And so we meet her on Tuesday.
I honestly have no memory of this meeting.
But Marie says we met on Tuesday.
I don't know.
I don't remember it.
I mean, briefly, I remember saying, okay, thank you, shaking a hand.
But I don't know, maybe because I didn't sleep much the night before.
Cause I mean, it's really weird when you don't sleep, you know,
and then, you know, cause I'll take a nap at like 130 when the market closes.
And then my mind will refresh itself.
But sometimes I don't get that nap.
So, but Marie showed me and she said, look, right here,
you can see the text between Lori and us.
She was here on Tuesday.
So she went back home and she came back on Friday.
And that was her first day.
She worked Friday and she was good.
And we paid her 80 bucks in the center on Saturday.
She comes back, but she comes late.
Okay.
She is like very late.
And she says, I went to the dentist and had an abscess.
And she showed pictures to prove it that she was at the dentist.
I said, okay, fine.
So she does all the cleanser of the kitchen,
does all the dishes and does the sheets, half the sheets of laundry.
It takes Marla with her.
One interesting thing happened.
Marla was freaked out in the laundry room.
And he said to his mom and friends that she,
Lori turned white and really white.
And he thought she was going to die.
This is Marla.
So he was very scared for her.
And we sat her down.
We asked her, are you okay?
She said, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's a COPD she has.
It's called, it's some sort of pulmonary thing.
I don't really know.
Apparently.
Yes.
Apparently she has machines at home.
She has a machine, like a little machine that helps her breathe.
Which I'm like, okay.
And she had a bunch of these things.
The inhaler.
And it's strange.
Everyone has an inhaler.
She knows, but there's a different looking one.
It's very odd.
And it has the date and a wheel.
So I don't know that much about that one.
She doesn't want to go home.
Okay.
She's like 60 years old, mid 60s actually.
Found out how old she was.
She was born in 1960.
So she's exactly 60 years.
And then the reason I did that math really quick is because I already knew the answer.
Okay.
I knew the answer.
So she starts crying.
At first it was a laugh.
I heard them both laughing upstairs and I said, what's so funny?
What's the joke?
I want to know the joke.
And I go, oh, you won't get it.
You're a man.
I'm like, oh, okay, fine.
And then I go to the bathroom and then I come out and the crying turned to sobbing.
Severe fucking sobbing.
She was hugging Marie and Marie looked at me like, you know, she also gave me like the
go away.
It's a girl thing.
You're not going to let me handle it.
It's okay.
So I go downstairs and Marie says, look, let's let her stay.
She doesn't want to go home.
So we'll put her up in the, we have in the little room at the top of the, if you see the layout,
come over.
You guys will see the layout for yourselves.
So she stays in the little room upstairs.
I don't think much too much about it.
It's not a big deal.
She wakes up, she takes a bath, which is odd.
You know, you don't do that.
It's a weird behavior.
She takes a bath and she starts cleaning again.
And we're like, okay, fine.
Clean again.
Sunday was the last, a third day anyway.
We did a three day trial and it was the final day.
So we knew she was gone for good no matter what on Sunday.
She's always going out to her car.
Okay.
Which I did not think was too suspicious.
I just thought she was going to join or something because she came back a little, you know,
different, but happy, always happy, not miserable.
And she would talk about her life a little bit.
She told us about her daughter in Italy and she married a very wealthy Italian guy.
And then it gets to be around 9.30, 10.
And I'm like, Marie, you handled the hours.
I don't, we're not going to pay her for the time she slept.
Right.
We're not paying her.
So you take care of this.
I don't want to deal with it.
I'm going to the number and I'll send her the money.
Marie goes, says, okay.
Next thing I'm in my office area.
Marie is not hit with her.
She comes in and says, I'm really tired.
Do you mind if I lay down for a few minutes before I drive home?
And I say, sure, fine, no problem.
So she's wearing like a jacket getting ready to, she's ready to leave.
And then I look at her and like, she's actually ready to leave.
It's good.
Take a nap.
Go for it.
She lies down.
She doesn't wake up.
She dies.
She fucking died on her bed.
She's fucking dead.
Like fucking dead.
Right.
And the only reason I knew she was dead was later because I mean, I thought she was alive
because at any moment I thought she was going to pop up and we're pushing her and stuff like that.
And I tried to feel for a pulse and I sort of remember what to do.
And I swear to God, I felt the pulse and there was warmth in her wrist.
And it was, unless I was feeling my own pulse in my fingers, which people do that too.
I don't know.
But it wasn't until she, like, I don't know anything about it.
I mean, I saw my father dead, but I never saw that this happened.
Like her face turned, it was like a bruise color.
It was a purplish.
It was not natural.
And that's when we knew, like, holy shit, this woman is dead.
And now it's fucking scary.
So we were freaked out.
Marla did not see anything.
He was asleep.
He was asleep.
He's got his little treehouse room on the other side of the wall.
Oh, thank you.
Of course.
Jesus.
I mean, we didn't want him walking in either.
So at all times, I had someone had to be in front of that door just in case he came down.
Like, yeah, he doesn't want some more Cheerios, you know, kind of like TV.
But of course, this morning, Marla, you can watch all the TV you want.
You go upstairs and you watch TV.
This is TV morning, right?
You watch as much as you want.
And Marie called the ambulance.
And then all hell broke loose, man.
Is it?
The ambulance came.
And what we learned later from the report, because it's in the report,
was that, supposedly, Sabah, Sabah, hate with a B, having to,
was talking to Patel at 9.30 a.m. in the morning on a Monday, which is weird.
Because Patel did not, she either did not sleep in that before or this is all a lie.
Okay.
And calls and says, holy shit, there's an ambulance going to Val's and Marie's.
Come over now.
And then she calls Steve.
And Steve comes over.
So LAPD is there.
The ambulance people are there.
Steve is there.
Patel is there.
And not only is she there, but she is screaming at him.
He's calling us murderers, saying profanities.
Throwing fucking rocks.
Throwing fucking rocks.
All right.
That's how fucking crazy she is.
Not only did she show up, but all the people that hate us in the building are there.
Just like really enjoying this.
Not in the building, but the campus.
And there's a, there's three or four of them.
You know, and one of them is the management.
We're in a huge fight with the management.
A woman named Ashley Madison.
Ashley Madison.
Ashley Madison.
Ashley Madison.
Ashley Madison.
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't hack that.
Actually, something, she's just a pain in the ass.
And she decided, oh, can I just tell you, police officers that Val, we always thought Val was on drugs.
We always thought Marie was on drugs.
And Bob, Bob, Bob.
Okay.
And she, and then this guy named Stosh.
And I'll tell you, he's like one of these people that always wished he was a Marine, you know, the types.
They're like, they wear like the clothes, like they pretend that they were served in Vietnam.
And they pretend they served in Afghanistan, but they never did anything.
And they never even left their town.
And he works at the building too.
He opens the door for the cars, basically.
He's like a dormant for cars.
But the attitude, and he's very, he's got this racist fucking thing too.
And he was there too.
And he said, excuse me, officer, I would like to talk to you in person a little longer afterwards.
Yeah, I know exactly.
He's just going to talk shit about me.
And I just was like, what the fuck is happening?
The film crew that's following me around, they came.
And they said, there was so much animosity in the air.
They said, we knew, and we don't want to tell you this, but we feel like this was the whole setup.
This was planned.
Like there was people, there was evil there.
There was something hatred there for you.
Yeah, yeah.
My name's Rocco.
It wasn't obviously not now.
And I've been told about this, Adore.
But Rocco Castoro, he was the former editor-in-chief of Vice.
And he's doing a documentary.
No.
Sorry?
Yeah, I think I saw it on YouTube.
Oh, you didn't?
It's on?
Formerly.
Yeah.
Sorry, you have a new channel.
Yeah, anything with some other, some dude named Tim Pool, which I don't know him,
but I heard bad things.
So I'm trying to distance myself from that name, is what I've been told.
It's like, well, whatever you do, don't associate yourself with that name.
But he's financing this project for some reason.
Yeah, trying to recreate Vice magic.
Exactly.
He was fired, actually.
Yeah.
It was the way he tells the sexual harassment thing that they were covering up in HR.
And it was a whole mess, because the sexual harassment was from wines,
the head of HR worked for Harvey Weinstein as well.
This is a whole fucking mess.
It's like a real fucking crazy shit.
Anyway, don't believe everything Rocco says, because he exaggerates and bellishes a lot.
But he did say, like, we were not welcome.
They told us to leave right away.
And not dating the police, the building.
So they had to take all this stuff and go.
And then Marie also said, I felt like we were set up.
I felt like, how did the fuck did Sabah already have a court date ready on the back of her car when she came?
How is that possible?
How did she have that court date for Monday?
And I was like, I don't know.
I don't know how DCFS works.
Apparently, the due process is not a thing there.
There's no such thing as due process.
They can do whatever the fuck they want.
And that is fucking terrifying.
And if you read that report and you were me, you would see.
If you could see from my point of view, which I don't know if you'll be able to because you're not me.
You don't know what I'm like and what Marie's like and Marla's like and Patel and Steve.
It's fucking terrifying that this is in the public record.
And there's a judge that yesterday, the judge heard this.
And I'm sorry.
I'm scared to have Hava, the social worker.
She comes.
Marie is fucking in tears.
She is crying.
She's inconsolable.
She is barely in our reality at this point.
And this woman comes up to her and says,
so did you kill her?
So was it an overdose?
Are you drugs?
Yeah?
Tell me how many drugs did you do today?
And she's like this.
Right there.
And Marie is just uncontrollably sobbing, telling her to fuck off as nice as she possibly can.
But she's answering the question.
She's like, no, of course not.
Where's the cleaning supply?
Show me the cleaning.
And the LAPD would not let her in the house.
So that was good.
They wanted this woman out there.
Now, I have some footage of her screaming at Marie because the security camera did get a pretty good view of it.
I have not gone through any yet because I've been going through all this other shit.
I will do that later today.
And I'll find out exactly what the fuck happened.
Now, everything was fine.
And the coroner, we had to wait for the coroner.
And the coroner comes in and he's like, he comes in like a superstar.
He's like, everyone's waiting for the coroner.
He shows up.
He's like, well dressed, well groomed.
He's like, hey guys, I'm here.
And I was like, OK, good.
Interesting.
He was like a personality, which was strange and interesting.
And then the whole mood changed.
And all suspicions toward me just sort of dissipated.
And the guy did his job and he was very thorough.
And he said, Val, here's the case number.
Any questions you call me?
I'm sorry to tell you, but when people die, there's a blood barrier thing in your nose.
And the blood drips out the nose.
So there's blood on the bed.
I was like, no, OK, it's disgusting.
He said, you're probably going to want to get rid of the sheets.
I was like, yes.
They will take them for us.
They can take the fucking sheets, man.
But Saba, during this time, takes M-[Redacted] and gives him the Steve
and decides that M-[Redacted] cannot be with us.
She makes this decision.
She's screaming at Marie.
Marie is inconsolable and she takes M-[Redacted].
She does not tell Marie, OK, until later.
And then M-[Redacted], and if Marie comes to me, I'm inside talking to police officers.
She took them.
They took M-[Redacted].
They took M-[Redacted].
So I start running out there.
I get to the fucking park and I see M-[Redacted] and he's sitting down.
I see Saba and they're going about to approach M-[Redacted].
I see Steve behind her.
Just fucking.
Steve's so sick, he's smiling.
He's fucking grinning.
He's fucking smiling.
He's so happy about this shit.
And I go there.
I say, you're not taking M-[Redacted].
No.
You're not taking M-[Redacted].
I get between her and M-[Redacted] and I say, no.
M-[Redacted] just comes with me.
He grabs my hand.
OK.
And Steve is not like this.
Saba is fucking upset.
And she goes, it's like this.
It makes me work hard.
It's sort of the sigh.
And then she walks over to the police officer and tells him something.
He comes over.
It's like, you have to release the child now.
You have to let him go now.
I don't even know who this woman is.
She comes here.
I don't even see a badge.
I have no paperwork.
I have his card with court date on it.
OK.
Nothing.
Do you see a badge around her?
She's just a social worker.
She's not a fucking officer.
And the guy says, listen, you have to let go of the child now.
So I'm like, OK.
So M-[Redacted] is going to be fine.
We'll figure it out.
Don't worry.
Et cetera.
Steve takes him off.
Takes him away.
And we haven't seen him since.
Now, we get this fucking shitty lawyer.
Here's a problem.
Sorry.
It's so convoluted.
But I just want to make sure you got it.
I want to be thorough.
Right?
I don't want to miss any details.
This is important.
Marie is so upset that she doesn't care a woman just died on the bed.
She gets a blanket and just goes on the bed and sleeps.
And I'm like, wow.
I didn't think she had that in her.
I was like, there's some coldness in her.
I'm like, Marie, use that coldness.
Later I am.
You've got to use that now.
You cannot lose your shit like you did today with Salva.
Because she was screaming and crying.
And Marie's not a weak woman.
But something happened at that moment.
The woman really worked her.
And then we immediately called this woman named Dorothy Gibbons White.
And she is a lawyer that represented a famous friend of Marie's that was an NCIS actress named Zoe.
And she did the most horrendous thing that he could do.
But you know what?
She fucking fights dirty.
She accused the husband of Zoe of being a child rapist.
Like raping the son, Sebastian, every day for like a year or something.
And I'm like, wow.
Let's fuck that.
And Marie's like, fuck that.
I don't think it's true.
I'm like, what?
And I'm like, I don't think it's true.
Like really?
It's like, we've got to get this woman.
You need to fucking hire her.
Because now we're so pissed off.
We need someone to fight dirty.
So we call her.
And she says, you know, Sebastian got off.
But he was held for four months in Kentucky.
The police caught him trying to go across state lines.
The FBI was involved.
It's a thing.
He really is this dirty.
And we start to believe her more.
And we want to believe her.
Right?
Because we want her help.
Because we know that she fights dirty.
We want some of the fucking women.
And I'm here at any cost.
Whatever the fucking cost is.
We want Marlo.
You know?
And she starts saying, does Steve ever hang out with JP?
JP is the name of the guy that's this child rapist.
And so he was the wife.
So if you look at the internet, if you Google those two names,
you'll see the story.
And as a matter of fact, Steve is friends with this guy, JP.
And all gravitates around this fucking school called Lila.
And the guy that's the head of that school is named Nordeem.
I filed a police report on him in May for being way too handsy
with Marie and all the women at that fucking school
and the children.
Because he is grabbing them, hugging them, everybody.
He's very handsy.
And it's a French thing to do.
I get it.
But we're not fucking friends.
All right?
And Marlo doesn't like it.
He does not like it when the guy grabs his fucking shoulder
all the time and rubs his back.
He doesn't like it.
And I tell Marlo, well, tell him not to do it.
You know?
If I'd see him, I'll fucking tell him.
But I've never seen him do it.
Marlo tells us.
So I was pissed off.
And on top of that, this guy says to Marie right to email,
Marie wants to have a meeting with the teacher
because we're worried about Marlo's work
because he wasn't doing his math and work.
He's lying to us about it.
And she wanted to set up a meeting.
And Nordeem said, he's the head guy.
The guy that's too handsy says, Marie.
He's the principal.
He's the principal.
Yeah.
He says, Marie, I would go, but you have to go.
I'll tell you when the meeting will be.
And Steve is going to be there.
And Marie says, I'm not.
I can't be in a room with Steve.
I do not want to be meeting with Steve.
I'll do my own meeting.
Steve can do it.
I have his own meeting.
And then he says, and I shit you not, Marie,
if you don't go to the meeting with your husband,
I will call Child Services on you.
In an email.
And we have that email.
OK.
And then that's when I lose my shit.
And I fucking call the police.
I said, this guy's harassing us.
He's being fucking handsy.
He just threatened my girlfriend.
And what he does with the kids is fucking strange.
Now, take that completely unrelated.
I had no idea that Dorothy Gibbons White, the prosecutor,
also had a file on this guy.
Apparently, there is something fucking weird shit going on down there.
How much of it is real?
I don't know.
How much of it is fake?
I don't know.
Because she is, again, fights dirty.
But she blends fiction with fact, but she does it well.
And I can't even fucking tell the truth anymore.
So I don't care at this point.
Maria doesn't care.
We're going to have to go to that level and accuse Steve
of hanging out with a known fucking kiddie fiddler.
How to file.
If that's what's going to win, then let's just fucking do it.
So she says, all right.
But here she says, and I have, and I'm
happy if you guys want to take this further and go for it.
Because I have, I recorded all of it.
So you have her on tape saying to Marie,
do you think Marlo, could you get Marlo to say this?
Could you get him to say this?
She's like, probably.
Yeah.
This is what we need Marlo to say.
And Marlo's eight.
She's fucking saying that on the phone.
She says, if I were you, it was my family,
I would want Mike Kratzmer to represent me.
It's like a mafia down there.
But he's in the mafia, but he's like a spy.
He's a good guy.
I'm like, OK.
So that's the guy we call.
He immediately wants $15,000.
And he is a fucking piece of work.
And he's the worst lawyer I've ever fucking seen.
He's the one that reached out to jamming
and said he was representing me.
All right.
No, there's one thing I missed.
I thought it was $15,000.
No, we did not.
No, not at all.
Fuck yeah.
That's $700 an hour for three days of work.
And what he did on Monday was nothing.
He did not say a fucking, he did not defend us.
He said, I don't even have to show up on the camera.
OK.
Just Marie's going to sit there.
So I set up this whole thing with lights,
beautiful.
And you have to call him.
Yeah, you have to call him.
Yeah.
And a proper camera with a proper lens.
So she looked good.
Like everyone else was looking good, right?
But the lawyer, no, he fucked up.
Sent us a link at the last second.
And she had to do it from her phone.
It looked terrible.
And we were the only ones, or she was the only one
holding the phone.
Everyone else was at their computers.
Well-dressed.
Everything looked good.
And Marie's, we just looked unprepared.
And Clumsy Inn just, it was terrible.
And the lawyer did not defend us.
He did not say that none of this is true.
He didn't say that the teal was crazy.
He didn't say that Steve was using this as a tool for anything.
He just said one thing.
He said, all I ask is that the child is not sleeping
in the same bed as the father.
And I say, oh shit, I know who he's going for.
I know who he's building up, what he's going to build up to.
But he doesn't defend us.
And that's when I start losing, then I start texting him
and say, what are you doing?
You didn't put anything into evidence.
You didn't mention anything about all these disdainless litany
things I've sent him.
And he just screams at me and tells me,
I'm not listening to him.
I don't know what I'm doing.
If I was a brain surgeon, would you tell a brain surgeon
what to do?
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
And then it was just-
Did you submit a brief to the court?
I don't know.
We don't even have it.
As far as I know, he submitted nothing.
He said he didn't give the court anything.
He just asked the late, did you read the documents?
And she says, not yet, give me a few minutes.
That's all I remember.
And then she read the documents.
And then she said, I want to see this guy dial.
Because I'm painting out to be this controlling, fucking asshole
that is like, you know, Marie is too weak to speak for herself.
And Marie is so fucking sick of hearing from men telling her
how weak she is that she needs another man to speak for her.
Like, if you guys don't ever tell that to her,
because she's slacking.
All right.
But that's how she's painted out, not only by Steve,
but by everybody.
All right.
And now I am the controlling Spangali that is controlling her.
For what purpose?
I don't know.
You know, it's not like she has money.
There's nothing I want.
I'm trying to get for her.
But apparently this is what I'm painting out.
There's one more important thing after that.
It's where I forget.
It's really important.
Lori, the woman, she took out the garbage once.
I wish there was one more than one.
But there was this one time, I think it was Saturday.
There were three of that.
Lori's the one who passed the law.
Yes.
Yes.
But three different bags of black garbage.
And I wasn't, this is told to me by Marie.
It's the second hand.
Marie will tell you the full story, much better than me.
And Marie felt something was wrong.
Something suspicious, because she was watching the bags
from upstairs, which she thought was great.
So Marie said, I'll just take these bags out.
And Marie and Lori was trying to tell her,
no, don't do what I'll do.
And she's like, no, that's okay.
I'll take them out.
And I think M-[Redacted] goes with her.
I don't remember.
She goes outside.
She opens the garbage.
And in Garbage Bag A are my files from when
I was in Cook County, foster care.
It's a stack of this big that I got when David was
doing my background.
And so we got all this stuff from Cook County in Chicago.
And it's a huge stack of papers of my own,
tired childhood, in the misery of it all.
Included in that is a notebook that I wrote in,
like poems and songs from when I was like 16 or 17.
And there was another screenplay that was really
terrible, shitty screenplay, but I don't know
why she chose that.
But you had to go to get this file.
You had to know where they were.
They were in my library.
And you have to go and scrap them.
It was not something that was accessible.
Now bag number two was the same thing,
but for M-[Redacted].
It was M-[Redacted]'s school assessments,
all the teacher assessments, all his grades,
everything he's ever gotten from school.
It's all in this one dossier sort of thing.
In the third bag, there wasn't anything interesting.
She said there was, there might have been something,
but not like this, something else.
And so Marie flipped out, you know,
what this means.
I still don't know what this means.
It's very strange.
So she was taking out the trash,
but it hadn't gone all the way yet?
No.
Well, she was going to steal it.
So she was pretending, this is how she was going
to get the papers out in the garbage cans,
in the garbage bags, and then pretend that she was...
Yes, yes, this stage.
And that's why maybe she was going to her car all the time.
And we found out that she did steal some shit from us,
which is funny enough, the Crystal Jewelry.
I shit she not, I shit she not.
She stole the fucking Crystal Jewelry that M-[Redacted] made.
Yes.
Okay.
So that's the short version.
Yeah?
Cleaning up.
Cleaning up.
Yeah, and then I got...
Actually, yesterday, I got a text from Rocco,
who's the guy...
The film...
The film...
Yeah, the ex-Vice News guy.
He said...
He did some background on Lori,
and he said that she was...
Rocco.
Okay.
It's Lori Roth, date of birth, 117, 1960.
She has an extensive criminal history,
breaking and entering, distribution and trespassing.
If your neighbor was watching M-[Redacted]
and claiming he had bruises around the times,
we were shooting, I can refute that with footage.
Okay, let's...
Yeah, she claimed that he had bruises and a black eye.
That M-[Redacted] had a fucking black eye.
Never.
Never.
Never.
Never.
He never had bruises other than falling off his bicycle.
You know, his scraped knee.
What did the judge finally decide on Monday?
The judge said...
The judge said, okay, great.
So, I want to see this Val person.
Can we please see Val?
And so, he recalls me and I sit down.
I don't say a word,
because our lawyer says, don't talk.
So, I listen to the lawyer.
And she looks at me.
There's a pause for like three or four seconds,
and she says, I'm going to recommend
that the child does not see Val Brooksman at all
and has minimum visits with the mother.
Minimum visits.
Minimum.
Like, the bare minimum that they have to...
The minimum.
They could give away a few hours, three days a week.
You know?
Is there a deadline that someone not acquires
or wouldn't go back to court?
Nope.
We had no paperwork.
We did nothing.
I had no paperwork from anyone.
No one from fucking DCF asked.
From the courts.
Nothing.
Can you tell me on September 29th,
you guys have the follow-up hearing
where they'll make a more firm decision?
Or is that...
Yeah.
So, on September 15th,
I thought that was the court,
that if it's not,
it's when the investigator has to hand in his paperwork.
And then the next trial date is the 29th.
And if there's no amicable decision made,
October 1st is the real trial,
like a trial trial,
where people will get witnesses,
like the television or something.
Okay.
So, yeah.
So that's...
All right.
The short version.
It's pretty crazy.
It's like the cop said,
he's like,
you got hit with a double wham.
A double wham.
And that's been stuck in my head ever since.
He was very right.
He was a double fucking triple wham.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Speak my language.
How often does that film feature,
you know, sector guys?
Not often.
Not anymore.
So they've filmed...
So David Enrich,
you know,
he tried to get a film deal
during this whole thing,
very unethical,
and he held on to...
You probably don't want to hear any of this shit,
but I'll tell you anyway,
because it's so fucking political.
If you're like Tim and Jim,
you don't want to hear it.
But Trump has these loans
with Deutsche Bank, right?
And David sat on them
for a very long time.
And I'm like,
why did you sit on them?
He said,
well, Deutsche Bank told me they were fake.
I'm like, no.
You listen to Deutsche Bank told me.
He has a deal set up with Deutsche Bank.
It's kind of Eurgen.
I forgot his last name,
but he's the head of the PR.
It's a, you know,
scratch on my back,
I'll scratch yours.
And for example,
with Tom Bowers,
remember Tom Bowers?
Tom Bowers was
Rosemary Vibraleck's boss
at DBTCA.
Rosemary Vibraleck
was Trump's private banker
at Deutsche Bank.
So he died.
His death was very suspicious.
It was suicide.
He hung himself in Malibu.
It was similar to my father.
Very similar.
And then the coroner,
there was a huge problem with the body.
We couldn't get the police report
because the body had melted
mysteriously on Christmas Day
and they shipped it to Virginia
for some reason.
And that's, so we can't,
it's cause of death,
no one can tell anyone.
Very fucking weird, right?
Of all the bodies in the world,
of all the deaths in the world,
this is death.
That is, no evidence.
It's just fucking strange.
And that was the last time
I spoke to Jim and Tammy as well.
I bring up Tom Bowers
because, why do I bring up Tom Bowers?
Oh, because he knows about the lungs, right?
That was David's source.
And I know that can be a whole mean source.
And then when he died,
David tweeted out,
it was a sad day,
Tom Bowers died today.
He said, he's a good man.
He's got a family, sir.
He left out the most important bit,
suicide, right?
Because he has to deal with
Deutsche Grange.
They said, do not imagine the suicide.
So it was myself and Scott Steadman.
I told Scott about it.
And Scott is a,
he's like a Twitter,
forensic music,
he runs this thing called forensic music.
It's like a Twitter phenomenon.
It's like 20 years old,
he's got a million followers.
Because he handles
the Trump-Russia thing really well.
So I tell him this story
and he gets on.
He's a genius with public information.
He finds anything in the public domain
and he gets the cause of death.
And then we do a story about the cause of death.
And now we're in a battle against David.
As I've always,
as I've been since that fucking article came up.
Sorry, that's,
I don't know why
it felt that was important
for you guys to know.
So you said David was,
you began by saying David was sitting on the,
sitting on the wall.
Yeah.
The Trump bill, you know.
But then,
forensic news,
did they have their own?
I mean, I guess the,
the George Bank of data,
seems like you shared it with Tim,
with Tim and more?
I did.
I gave it to Tim and Jeremy.
And then,
David also had a copy of it.
No, I never,
I never gave David a full,
I would never,
I do not,
you know,
I gave him a doc,
a selective amount of documents.
But then,
he's had the Trump data.
No.
No, no, no.
So how did,
how did David know about it?
Tell him about it.
Okay.
Now, if you remember,
there was a guy,
he's a pundit,
he's like a liberal-ish,
not Chris Matthews,
but,
I can't remember his name.
But he went on the air one,
one night and said,
ladies and gentlemen breaking news,
I have the Trump loan documents,
from the Russian banks.
And they are very well,
very much exactly what you thought,
you guys all thought.
Stay tuned,
et cetera, et cetera.
Next day,
he says,
ladies and gentlemen,
I have to retract my statement,
from the other night.
I don't have them.
Turns out they were fraudulent.
And so,
what the fuck.
And Deutsche Bank's lawyer
has got ahold of this guy.
He's a famous name,
I just can't,
it's not coming to my mind.
And told him that
these are fraudulent documents
and if you go,
you're gonna fucking see the shit out of you,
you're never gonna work again.
And that's what you got scared
and backed out.
Now there are some fraudulent documents
out there,
I've seen them on Scribd.
They're terrible,
frauds,
but these aren't the ones.
These are different documents.
Fraudulent documents are more...
Not in my data set.
Not just Deutsche Bank.
Well,
my data set's grown substantially
since 2014,
but it's not from my data set.
Please.
It's like no one's talking about
the best way that we can help people.
There's a couple options right now
that we already have to talk about a little bit
as far as the investigator goes, right?
What are the allegations against you?
I mean, I know we've talked about all of them,
but you have like some where you've,
like if you see the lack of food
and you have cell phones everywhere.
Yeah, I don't really know what the allegations are,
other than drug addicts.
You know, but it's easy to call them drug addicts.
I am very open about my past.
Right.
You know, I've taken drugs.
It's a big deal.
You're not undergoing now,
because you said you know a drug test.
Yes.
So that should be,
that should probably solve itself, right?
It should, but it doesn't.
It didn't,
because then the,
our lawyers just don't take any drug tests,
don't talk to them if they call,
you hang up.
If they're at the door,
you don't open it.
They're like, okay, fine.
Do you recommend that safe thing?
I don't know.
Well,
he's the lawyer.
I just decided,
he knows more than me.
So I trust him,
blindly,
until yesterday.
My,
my,
so that's what I did.
And that was stupid of me.
Very fucking stupid of me.
And Marie did the same thing.
And if I had not trusted him,
Marie would not have trusted him.
Does Marie also get a drug test
after her work you said?
Yes,
randomly.
Yes.
I would imagine that.
It wouldn't be a huge issue,
because if Marie already got a drug test,
there would be one after the last.
Right.
And it's perfectly okay to go with your own doctor,
because you don't trust these DCF people
and give your own fucking drug test.
You're overseen by doctor,
and your doctor will hand it to you.
That's fine too.
I read it online.
But the Saba woman would not allow that.
She didn't want that.
And I also said,
no,
Saba,
and I have it on the table.
Saba,
I said I was willing to take a drug test.
I didn't say I was going to be there
at 3.30
and Beverly Hills
on fucking Friday.
That I did not say.
It was,
well,
you know that if you don't take a test,
it's going to,
that means that you are called,
quote, dirty,
they call it.
Well,
that's a,
well,
you know that's a bunch of bullshit.
It's a lie.
Why would you do that?
That's just the way it is.
Can she get what you want
in Beverly Hills?
She said anytime between nine
and five
on a Friday,
on Friday,
yes,
in Beverly Hills.
Okay.
And then I was,
we're both ready to go
until Thursday night
before police come.
Okay.
And then we're pissed off.
And we're like,
you know what?
I'd help that Mike
recommend not.
Yes.
Yes.
So it's like,
you know,
we weren't even supposed to call her
and say no,
we're just,
but we picked up the phone
or stupidly even talked to her.
But this woman is,
it's like,
something's wrong.
Something's really wrong.
We don't know what it is.
I know what I don't know,
which is a substantial.
Are you guys,
do you guys know anything even,
that I don't know?
What can you help me with this?
What is happening?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have no idea.
No one's told me anything.
Even Mike,
the lawyer is supposed to be
the greatest ever.
He doesn't,
he told me shit.
He fired him.
That's right.
Interesting.
Do you guys have things
for another lawyer?
Well,
that's what I was going to find
out today.
See what you guys can do.
And if you could save us,
you know,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
If you could save us,
you know,
$15,000,
it would be great.
But I'm trying,
I have to gauge what you can do
to see if I need a lawyer.
That's why I'm
making this right now.
So not only you're gauging me,
but I'm gauging this.
It's a tough call.
Like,
we're not going to send
an FBI lawyer to represent me.
Right.
The things we can do,
I mean,
if there's a question of money,
sometimes we can
get you some money.
But obviously I can't.
We have,
You know, obviously, we're not wealthy, but we can do this.
Yeah, remember what you were saying,
and I mean, you've missed your wealth yourself.
You said trade didn't end one time.
Yeah, I mean, I've lost more than you made, but yeah, I got it.
You know, don't tell, don't tell Mary.
You're doing the last few more.
Actually, that's probably my best, when crisis, time, and crisis.
So there's that type of stuff.
The other thing that we talked about, too, is we have to keep
our relationship secret.
Yeah, that's the only way that we can do it.
So if, you know, I call a shop, stop, or something like that,
and say, hey, we've got the deal, so we'll tell you why you want to know.
Sure.
You have to stay small on it, right?
So our relationship with you is going to be limited in scope, right?
Like we talked about, it's likely going to be something where, you know,
it's going to be something.
You know, I look at electronic cigarette thing, I just can't believe it.
Are you going to know all this smoke, electronic?
Really? Inside?
It's just, but it's not real.
I'm not aware of it.
So the main thing that we would call it, the main thing that we would be able to
help with is, like, everything's going well, right?
We can't change what's going on in the past, right?
Because we can't change what, you know, Isala said, or what your neighbors have
said, or anything.
Sure, right.
But going forward, we can help you with the investigator, right?
Because the investigator is going to assess you and Marie to see if you
get the two full parents.
So those are things that we can help with.
I'm trying to think there are other avenues that would like you.
I made a whole list of stuff.
I've been studying law for like a week, okay?
I'm not a lawyer, but I figured there's some things that they've done very
illegally, all right?
Due process still exists, even in that court, all right?
Even though some lawyers say no, some lawyers say yes, it does exist.
We read online on reputable law websites.
They're not supposed to invite themselves in and walk in.
They did.
This woman is clearly, the lies are so ridiculously, too many lies.
And the only reason for that is to paint a picture because you have an agenda.
Why, why she has this agenda?
Why she wants to destroy me or Marie?
I don't know, I mean, I get it.
I've encountered people like this before.
I don't know why they do it, but they want to do it.
It's either, Marie always says I'm going to kill this, you know?
I don't think it's jealousy.
I think it's something else.
I don't know what it is, but there's some reason that she wants us destroyed.
And she, and you have to, what I've learned is that this system,
just the DCFS, is very corrupt.
There's some, they know each other.
It's ancestral, they all know each other.
This guy that worked there, our lawyer and customer, he was threatening Marie.
Okay, when we left, he fucking threatened her and said, you know what?
If you don't get a vow, because I was calling him out, I said, why didn't you do this?
If you don't get a vow to stop acting like a bully and know everything,
you're going to have to make a choice between your son and Val.
We have that on tape, too.
You got to hear this fucking, too.
It's crazy.
Okay.
Full soldier, too, I've dealt with this and other cases that are similar to yours.
With DCFI?
With DCFI?
In Texas.
Oh, okay.
In some organizations.
But we don't, the thing is, I'm not an expert either, right?
We've worked with some things in the past that have been successful stuff,
and we actually got some good work out of it.
Everything turned out fine.
So that's my experience with it.
I'm not an expert in custody law and now across this work,
I learn something new every day.
So the primary issue I see is this, like, if we're going to help, right,
we're going to help and be effective in our job, but also be effective for you.
So trying to uncover a conspiracy with Saba makes it, like, I mean,
I don't think there's some weird stuff going on, but that's what I'm saying is that
if the investigator does his job properly or her job properly,
they should see that you guys are successful parents who can help raise M-[Redacted]
in a very productive way.
But here's the thing.
Any competent person, whether you're a DCFS or a police officer,
anyone that is trained to deal with people,
can delineate a same person from an insane person, right?
You should be able to do that.
Now, when you meet Patel and you read her shit, she's obviously fucking nuts, right?
Sorry for this, but clinical terms, she's fucking nuts.
She's out there.
And for Saba, I know is able to determine the difference between saying and not saying.
So she purposely, I suspect that she's a smart person,
that she purposely included this woman's testimony for a reason.
She's against it, because she must know that she's fucking nuts.
They're using her.
It's sad for this woman.
I'm not that sympathetic for her anymore because she's did it, but it's, you know what I mean?
I'm not saying it's very simple.
It's the first time I've heard it.
So you're saying that she's clinically insane, right?
She's got a frontier bipolar.
Maybe not insane, but that's exaggeration.
Mentally unstable, for sure.
Classic bipolar.
I'm willing to bet you anything you'll find bipolar medication.
But just for reference, right?
We probably wouldn't want to make that claim, right?
You would, yes.
Or you would not.
Because if it's one, easy to tell that someone is clinically insane, and two,
you know that she's insane, and three, why would you give custody to her
for several hours a week?
Because we didn't know it at the time.
He just hurt himself, right?
So like, you know at the time, he's same argument to the lady with the investigation.
So that's an avenue I think would be dangerous for you than anything else, right?
So we get her to retract her statement.
Well, here's the thing.
So again, are we going to go over there and break her off to retract the statement?
Yeah, I'm ready to go to the Armenian.
I'm like, let's go find the Armenians.
They handle this shit, right?
Luckily, we're lucky for you.
The FBI doesn't do that, right?
I mean, we are on the side of good because we're not going to influence people in that way.
It's just not how we work.
And like I told you on phone, I'll be honest with you.
What we can and what we can't do, I'm not going to make a story for you to say like,
oh, we can turn the world around immediately for you right now.
No, I know.
I know.
I don't expect that.
But I'm trying to work with you to see what avenues we can best help with.
So like I said, the best thing I can think of right now is influencing how you're perceived.
And not in a negative way, not in a way that's illegal or anything, but just saying like,
hey, if you have these issues, if you have, they say, oh, there's not enough food in the house.
And then we just show receipts, you get an Amazon delivery every week or something like that.
Yeah, we have the receipts.
So all those things would be easily refuted by evidence that you can show.
And there's no evidence that the FBI is helping you or, you know, if we give you money to do that,
that's just cash that you have, right?
So all those things are ways that we can help your view in the court size.
Because what we talked about too and what we talked about on the phone is that it's very rare
that they take custody completely away from the parent.
It can happen in very extreme cases, but at least the ones that I've been involved in,
the judge almost always favors.
And what we talked about, the mom almost wouldn't have a father or whatever.
I believe that you believe that.
But what I've read and studied in the last few days about this specific system in Los Angeles
and these people, it's not that.
It's the opposite.
They give it to the perpetrator.
They give it to the person that has the most money or the person that's been doing the illegal fake calls.
Because this is, obviously you can imagine, this is a tool used in many, many divorces.
That's the complicated part of it.
And I have not experienced in this, but just, you know, you've had an experience in the past
and you've been like, this is complicated.
It's not just a child welfare situation, it's a divorce.
It's weaponized.
They weaponized DCFS for divorce.
It's terrible, but that's what's happening.
And they know it.
And they're using it and making a lot of money.
They're fucking lawyers and judges.
Like, for example, Sabah makes $120,000 a year.
Her supervisor makes 210 public records.
That's a lot of money for DCFS, right?
And they have the other $80,000.
What's other?
Where did that $80,000 come from?
Over time.
$60,000.
Over time.
And $25,000.
Other $90,000.
So what the fuck?
Is that normal?
I don't know, okay.
Anyway, I'm just saying it's suspicious to me.
But yeah, well, what can you do?
What can you do?
What is in your power and what's not?
We have to do some more research, because the issue is what we can do would make it
over it also, right?
Also, you don't have a rebuttal either.
We wrote it on the piece of paper, the FPVF thing with like these, then we put sticky
notes on the fake sticky notes on a digital thing.
Can't find it anywhere.
It only took two days to write it, and now we can't find the sticky notes.
We have to write it again.
So we will get you that.
We will get you that.
And I haven't uploaded all the evidence yet, like all the recordings that we have and
all the video recordings, audio and video.
So, the last time I checked the email address, I didn't see anything, but that was before
I left.
You didn't see anything?
No.
I sent it to you.
I sent it to that email address on Sunday night, and I checked on Monday to get anything
yet.
But you don't, this should be, I sent you like a shitload of stuff last night, last night.
Oh, last night?
Yeah.
Okay.
I haven't checked it.
Oh, okay.
Because I haven't been flying in a year.
It's okay.
I sent you the text saying, I'm sorry, I just saw this now.
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
I haven't checked whatever it is you sent.
Okay, good.
Okay.
You've got a lot, there's a lot of reading in there.
You'll see.
But you've read the report, though.
I don't have, if you sent the report in that group, I haven't read it yet.
The good report?
No.
So, yeah, I just have a good report.
Oh, good.
Okay.
So, you sort of, oh, good.
I got to you first.
That's good.
So, you get your first impression from me first.
Not that report.
That's a good sign for me.
Very happy to hear that.
That's good.
So, we can do some more research on our insights, see what thing you have.
Good.
I can't promise anything else, but I cannot promise my own right.
Like, I can't promise that I mean you don't need all of that help at all.
That's good to me.
But I can't tell you I'll be honest, right?
I'll be honest with you about what we can do and what we can't do.
And, I'll give you some options sometimes and say, well, we can try this and try that.
It may include to different ways.
But I can't promise what I promise what we can do.
I got that.
Um, Look, what do you want if you want it?
What did you have on there that you wanted to show up?
Seriously, it will be here all week.
OK, can you even find it in summary,
like the overview of what you see?
Do you like political shit?
Or do you like give me a genre?
I work in cyber crime.
Oh, you do?
OK, that's what I thought.
You read it on that article, I know.
So you're going to do that part, right?
So I work in cyber crime.
So we look for hackers.
We do ransomware, or BTC, and jacking.
Oh, you do?
Really?
Yeah, we do much other stuff, like computer issues in general.
I do some stalking pieces.
Do you have all the toys in tact shit, too?
I've got a lot of toys.
Oh, really?
OK.
But yeah.
Dude, OK.
Do you need like an apprentice?
All right.
Do you want to come out to QC and see all the toys we have?
In our hand presses, and then you ask the whole band to give them out.
Well, yeah, OK.
OK, yeah, well, I can help you.
I'm a self-taught hacker.
I'm not very good.
I did not hack Sony, OK?
I did not do that.
They was accused of that, but I did not do that.
The stuff on DDoS Secrets, I was stupid enough to say,
I'm like, can you actually give me credit for my stuff?
Can you put my name?
I'm the only idiot that said, here, put my name on it.
But MPS, Monty Duposky, that was not a hack of the documents
were given to me by the Anatella Rossi.
So it was not a hack.
And she said, I want you to make this public as possible,
because we dated Rossi's story out there.
So I said, of course.
And she knew I had connections with New York Times,
and most returnals, and that's what she wanted.
So I helped her, and Luca was her lawyer.
It seems like a very, like you walk in one light bulb
on this old ancient desk, smoking a cigarette,
speaking Italian, perfectly safe of a lawyer.
He also wanted all this everywhere.
He wanted me to disseminate as much as I could.
We had a deal.
I said, if you can give me anything in McKaylee Faisola,
anything in my father, anything you got,
I'll give you whatever I have.
And I don't really, let's look for David Rossi.
I don't have much in here.
If you want to do it, you can do it right now.
So that was our trade.
And man, I told you in town, but he told me
the craziest fucking story.
It'll take a long time to tell you the story.
The short version is that Monty Duposky, the Calabria mafia,
is using MPS to launder their money.
And they're using it in very interesting and creative ways,
like putting cash in basketballs for the Italian basketball
team.
Literally, they'll have basketballs filled with cash.
And then they give the basketballs to some other team.
They trade them with other basketballs.
And that's how they do the cash exchange.
Fucking weird.
I swear to God.
And we've got David Rossi.
And Anatella says this happened.
And Luca says this is what happened.
David Rossi would pick up just a briefcase full of cash.
He'd rent a car.
He would drive from Siena to Lugano.
And he would just start dumping cash into different accounts.
And then one guy that picked up the cash count
is Cardinal Scorano from the Vatican, caught on CCTV.
And he's laundering money.
He's got a history of being a dirty banker as well.
So this is very interesting.
But no one's gone after him the second time.
He's got to go.
Or has to mention that he doesn't go.
Both of them.
And how do you know what to tell him?
I went over and then visited her.
When I was a, it's a really, it's another story
if you want to have a story time.
But I was trapped in Amsterdam.
Like literally trapped in a fucking campsite.
Someone broke into my rental car and stole,
like I had this computer in black case, Macbook,
and it was underneath the passenger seat.
And it's the dead of night in Amsterdam.
Like 3 AM, I'm going into town and I buy some cigarettes.
So I leave the car for a little, maybe 10 minutes.
And I walk back and cobblestone streets and I see glass.
I say, oh, poor fucker, guys, car broke in.
It's mine.
No, they did not take my passport.
They did not take my 30 or 40 euros.
You know, sitting in that little tray between the passenger
and the driver's mind.
They didn't take my fender strad in the back seat
or anything else.
They only took that computer, which I have a dutch bank
stuff that I had just bought in New York City
a month and a half prior.
And I just organized all my dutch bank shit,
all the files on that computer.
It was encrypted.
There's no way anyone can get to it.
And anyone that would pull off something like that,
it's got to be a shitty private investigator.
There's no, anyone that's sophisticated
would have just fucking hacked it, you know,
or given up on anyone saying it was encrypted.
There's no way in.
It was air gap, I forgot to say.
There's no way.
But that's the only thing that was taken.
And I suspect dutch bank hired a private investigator.
That's where I think.
In Prague, I thought I was gonna die
when this guy, Italian thug, pulls me out of the car
and starts beating on me.
And he doesn't speak a word of English.
I just came to buy some car to the mall in Czechoslovakia.
Have you ever been to a mall in Prague?
It's fucking weird.
It's a weird place.
I once died on a train.
Oh, in Prague?
What happened?
I got to get off.
No, no.
I ended up in a train.
That's not good.
It was not good.
No, it was like, it was bad.
Yeah, I hit the SOS button in the car, like,
help, I'm being murdered.
This guy's gonna murder me.
And I forgot, I had bought a fake gun,
like a BB gun in Germany.
And I never, I don't know anything about guns,
but I should have used it.
Maybe he would have run away,
but I forgot it was in the fucking apartment.
So instead I'm just like, I use my phone.
Look, you're on camera.
Stop kicking me, stop this.
You're being on camera.
And the SOS, here's it all.
And next thing I know, the fucking SWAT teams.
They got machine guns, there's six of them.
And they surround us, and they tell the guy,
he has fucking hands up, and I'm like,
that's the guy, we know that's the guy.
They're speaking English.
And then the dude does the strangest thing.
He's surrounded by the SWAT team, with M16s,
wherever those big guns are.
He takes off his shirt, so you can see he's topless, right?
Why does he take off his shirt?
Cause he's got military tattoos.
This is how he's going to communicate to the Czech police
that I'm one of you.
That's what he did in 20 of the time he looked
at the EU military, some sort of service.
And they put down the gun, it works.
They're like, what is going on here?
Turns out, we take over the police station,
and like a fucking lady from a central casting,
Interpol, shows up, you know?
He's like, I don't want to be here in a sunday or anything.
Get me, who's this stupid American, you know, sorry.
Turns out he's from Avis rental car,
and he just came to repo the car.
That's the fucking crazy shit that it was, man.
It was a weird time, you know?
I don't know why I told you that story, but it's fine.
What was the question?
Sorry.
Let's go back to your hacking system.
Oh, hacking?
Yes.
What kind of skills do you know,
what kind of techniques do you know?
Well, I guess my, the only one I pulled off,
like really successfully was my mother.
But we had a lot of time in planning, though.
It was just a man in the middle of watching my hack.
It was really easy.
Was it a Wi-Fi fan app or something?
I have a pineapple, but I did not use a pineapple.
I could not, I was like, I had no money, I had nothing.
I had to learn how to increase the output of my battery
power on the MacBook to handle all the fucking thoroughfare
that was coming in through the,
well, I had practiced at this hotel down there.
They called the, in Venice Beach,
but it was a, I spoofed their,
it's in Manhattan Beach,
and it was where I learned everything for two weeks.
Anyway, I spoofed the router,
and I learned Wireshark at that time,
which was like driving me crazy
because all I got were the packets,
but I could not figure out how to put the packets together
and took me, like, maybe I'm slow, I don't know,
but it took me a while to figure out
how to put the fucking packets together.
And once I did, I was like, shit, I have passwords now.
I have some, well, not full passwords,
they're still broken up,
but you can just put them into a algorithm that will,
yeah, John the Ripper or something,
anything that's, actually, John the Ripper won't work,
it's more like a, I don't know, it's,
Sorry?
Rainbow table?
No, the table one, that's not very easy one,
the table hack, that's the injection one,
were you in CaliLinux, you're talking about?
Yeah, it's been a long time since I took that class,
but I thought you're just running it
against a dictionary or something?
Yeah, well, you are, but you also had an algorithm
that's specific to what you're looking for.
Like, I knew my mom's,
my mom would have a very specific list
of names she would use, right?
So I had to plug in just those,
and I had to have the, you know,
anything over eight fucking,
it's good we can talk a little bit, this is fun,
anything over eight letters is gonna take over
a day and a half, unless you have a 20 gig GEX,
whatever, NVIDIA card, you know,
that's with Elkumsoft, which is the fastest
password cracker I've seen so far right now,
on the market, I'm sure you guys
probably have access to something cooler than that,
but it takes a long time.
But it's a lot of it, you just have to use your intuition
or make a phone call, you know, I didn't say you,
you know, that's the best way to do it is this,
they call it social engineering,
so that's the most fun way to do it.
How do you learn, like, do you take classes?
You too, we don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
I was, you don't understand, my dad just killed himself,
my mom cut me out of the family,
I was sequestered to rehab, it was a very nice rehab,
but I was not free, I was like, for four months,
I'd say that.
You're a whole lot more than me,
I've taken the classes that you and I,
I don't understand everything.
But I had to, it was like, if you have no money
and you have to feed yourself
and someone throws you in a foreign country,
you're gonna learn, you know, that's what it was for me,
it was like, I had to know why my dad killed himself,
I had to figure it out, I had to get into his email,
so I just sat down and fucking focused.
I was impressed, I was like,
I was planning on killing myself,
you know what, maybe my mom will learn something
if I die the same year, you know,
maybe my sister will never have the stuff,
I was being a martyr, you know,
I was being a little shit too, being an asshole.
And the doctor said, you know what Val,
we're gonna try and give you out or all,
let's see what this does, what the fuck that was like.
You know, and then I take it, I'm playing,
three hours like that.
All right, let's learn cocking, you know,
finance is next.
And you know what, it fucking saved my life that thing,
it really did, I drugged,
and people say don't be drugs,
but sometimes drugs really work, it shows you.
Yeah, if you're depressed, you don't see any hope,
sometimes the drug will just give you a glimpse
and remind you that there is another way
of viewing the world, you know, that's it.
But anyway, yeah, I was fueled with out or all,
it was very helpful.
Yeah, I found focus, I never, like I was a dumb musician,
I thought I had, there's no way I was gonna learn
how a derivative work, right?
I had no fucking, I was very proud of myself,
and I thought my father was very proud too,
and that's kind of another thing, kind of,
you know, a little fuel, a fuel to the fire.
So what other things really need to happen?
Like, do you know anything about ransomware?
I do, yeah, I stay away from it, it sounds,
I mean, it sounds like it's really,
it's not, I mean, I've never had anything around somewhere,
but it doesn't seem like a difficult thing to break,
I mean, it's gotta be localized on the computer
and you can isolate it, it's not,
if you take the computer offline,
it's not like a self-destruct button
that where all of a sudden your computer's gone dead,
you can isolate the fucking hack.
It's just like anything, you know, any virus.
Well, not like any virus, I don't know much about it,
but if someone's putting a foreign code
onto your computer, it's depending where it is,
and again, remember, there's different types,
and with Intel, the new shit we learned about Intel,
with the hack on the chips, there's a whole new,
it's like a whole new industry, but there's a whole new,
what's the word, like a way to get at data,
I can't remember the names of them
because it's, my brain's on 100% today,
but the ones, the Intel chips, the flaws
that were found about a year and a half ago,
do you remember what you know what I'm talking about?
The vulnerability, thank you.
What's it called?
Vulnerability?
Yeah, but what were the names of the ghost one?
Well, no, no, no, I don't,
I think the noise might be one of these problems.
So the things Intel fucked up,
and from the very beginning when we started making chips,
there was a cache, or a cache, or whether you can,
yes, we could get all the credentials back
from the actual chip, and every single computer
in the world is vulnerable to this, every single computer,
and that's fucking amazing, right?
So that gives you completely new access,
and three different companies found this out at the same time.
It's like the 100th monkey hearing.
Do you know the thing?
The 100th monkey?
Yeah, the 100th monkey.
Great, yeah, it's just, the idea has sort of happened.
But anyway, yeah, that's a whole new way of doing it.
I know how to do,
my best thing is social engineering,
and then, you know, I'm not really a coder.
I don't know how to do it,
but I can take other people's programs
and use them very well, you know?
Elk and Soft kind of pisses me off a little bit.
These guys, they overdo it, but,
I mean, I have magnet, I have Elk and Soft,
I have the orange one.
I can't remember, I can't remember what it's called.
Belk is off, there's no issue, you know what?
Oh, you know what?
I'll show you, I'll show you what I got.
You know, magnet is the best right now.
See, and I'm thinking, like, why go through,
why do all this extra work you don't need to do
if you can just get the fucking,
someone's already built the program,
we'll go out there and invent the wheel, right?
So if, for example, if Elk and Soft, oh shit,
let me see the options,
if Elk and Soft is already created a way
to get the tar ball off your iPhone 11,
why do I have to create a program
that do the same thing,
that you've got people that spend a lot of time
and money doing it?
So I'll just use their shit
and improvise with other people's shit.
Like, the pineapple is not that great, you know?
It's not that interesting.
And also it's a little, it's not user-friendly, you know?
It's like you have to really sit down and study
the fucking stick of pineapple and what not to do it.
So I build a, like a fast way to do it for my girlfriend
because she wanted to know how to do it,
but she had no patience to sit down
and learn how to keep the AP or the evil twin thing.
You know, so I just showed her like a,
I created like a shortcut for her, which is sort of-
How did you make it easier for her from Bernie?
I automated it, yeah.
It's easier if you do that,
because she just does one thing,
everything falls into place instead of making her,
it makes her think like she's accomplished something, you know?
It's not that hard to just automate, let me see, you know.
Sorry, so let me show you, for example.
Oh, Evan Tree was the other one.
The other one is her Wi-Fi off, it's Bluetooth off.
Oh, yeah.
Of course, of course.
Your security and ours, but-
Oh, really?
You guys got people, interesting.
Yeah, I mean, I think, sorry, I got all excited,
but I forgot that you guys were with the FBI.
Shit, okay, yeah, Wi-Fi's off, Bluetooth is off.
So let's pull up, like phone breaker,
Xcode, I can do, I don't know,
can you be more specific, is there something you're looking for?
It's not 10, it says your level of skill
would like need your help to do something.
Okay.
You know, we needed you to look at, you know,
vulnerable website or something like that,
is that something you could do?
Oh.
You know, if we had a phone, we'd be pretty good.
The phone I could do a lot better
than I could with the vulnerable website.
I could do the website, but it would take me a little extra time,
because I have not studied that one as much.
I mean, I used to do it before,
maybe when it was easy, when everything was on the server,
and you could just do it for the back space.
Remember, you could just do that stupid thing,
you know, maybe I could do that.
But the phone is more fun for me, that's easy,
that's not easy, but it's more of a challenge.
Because I did my dad's phone, I did my girlfriend's phone,
and then people would find phones on the street for me
and just sell it to me, it's just like a friend practice.
It is fun, that's what I like.
And the remote stuff is,
well, am I gonna get in trouble
for telling you guys something this short?
He told me like you murdered someone,
they probably didn't believe you.
I never murdered anybody, okay?
No murder, okay?
The New York Times asked me to hack Epstein.
Okay, so they didn't want me to hack Epstein.
So I did it, and everyone's very,
I didn't, oh sorry, I didn't do it.
I started the process of doing it,
and I gave him the list of passwords,
and I gave him the list,
and I have this on email to prove to you,
okay, the passwords, and I gave him the list of logins,
that's it, all the credentials.
And I gave him the Gislane's credentials as well.
I did not break in, I did try, okay, made an attempt,
but it was a double authentication,
someone already got to it.
I don't know whose number it is,
but I have a phone number if you wanna trace it,
it would be helpful for you guys.
And I found out a lot, for Kevin Hall,
actually, I did this one in the morning.
I know someone who's running around, so.
Oh, Kevin Hall is doing this one in the morning,
and he's a partner with me,
she wrote the Epstein story.
Yeah, she's really good, really good, yeah.
I didn't wanna know if someone was running around,
but I helped him by just looking at his old email addresses
from like 1999, old banks that he used in old,
just old accounts, and lawyers that he used as well,
because a lot of the lawyers are hiding some money too.
Stuff like that, yeah.
Just, you know, I usually don't give away a secret,
but I'll give you a secret,
and it'll make it seem so mundane and obvious to you,
you'll think like, why didn't I think of that?
It's the easiest possible way to start,
and mostly, people ask you to find a password,
this is the easiest thing to do.
You just get a database of the billion or so
already hacked files,
you find the old password that somebody used,
and you just sort of engineer from there,
it's not that hard, yeah.
A lot of people don't change their passwords,
and when they do, they make a variation.
That's all you have.
Right.
I used to usually work alone, you work with other people?
No, no, I don't understand how you work with,
I mean, teach me, there's a way to work with other people,
yeah, teach me, because usually, I don't know,
like usually it's one person doing all the work,
and the other person is watching, so, I don't know.
But yeah, I'd like to, I would love to try, I mean.
Yeah, like I said, right now I'm completely list of stuff
that like, okay, we could use help on this,
so it's maybe something that we could do.
We could try to find a spot for you, still.
I feel like it's that, I guess, on my head.
What I'm really good at doing is I could find
stolen money and money laundering.
If someone needs to move money,
I can show you how to do that.
I know how to, I know people that can reverse engineer,
there's a word for it, Bitcoin wallets?
Reverse growth, what do you call it?
Well, how do they, how do they,
I mean, if they're gonna track where the Bitcoin goes,
no, they can find, no, how, where it came from.
They can do the whole scrub, they call it,
it's not scrub, it's called the,
they're watching it now, like you're telling,
because it's all public, so that you can see
where it goes to and from,
you mean after it's been tumbled or something?
After it's been, yes.
Not tumbled, after it's been put into any wallet.
They can trace it, like a reverse trace.
There's two people I know that can do it.
That part's not too difficult, I'll tell you.
It's not, okay.
Oh, you can?
Okay, I don't know anything about it.
And it's just like the ledger is public,
so you can see where the money comes and goes to.
It's just that this number means nothing.
Oh, no, but it's not that simple.
I mean, yeah, I know there's an open ledger,
but it's also, there's like a wallet
that has self-account as well,
so you have to find out where it, yeah.
It's like, they know how to do that.
They can, they can,
I'm not sure what the wording is.
You see, that would be nice.
I would like to know what the terms are for these things.
I know how to do it, I know what the action is,
but I don't know the term, the term, the terminology.
Okay, so what other stuff do you have access to?
I mean, because you have access to a lot of journalists, right?
And here's the thing.
I don't really want to deal with journalists
because it's the first-minute stuff that's there.
Journalists have a lot of data.
They're a very untapped source of data.
You know, if you know how to say the right thing,
you can get all, I got the guys in Russia,
there was a spy on trial,
he's a banker spy, and I got the guy
to send me the whole fucking transcripts,
court records, everything.
You mean the journalist was able
to get the court records in 2017?
Yes, okay, yes, interesting.
Journalists have a lot of shit,
and they just sit on it and just goes,
once the story's done, they forget about it.
They don't need it anymore.
So there's a huge fucking great source of information.
Nobody even bothers to get it.
But I know so many journalists now,
and they're sending me shit all the time.
People, I just have this guy named,
well, I'm not gonna tell you his name,
because that would be kind of weird.
It would be weird to do that, too.
But he just found me on Twitter and said,
Val, I think that there's some shady shit
going on in the Bank of Ireland.
Can you take a look at this one?
And I guess, I take a look at it,
and lo and behold, Wilbur Ross stole $35 billion
from Bank of Ireland.
Well, Wilbur Ross and his compatriots,
but 23, he calls them hedge funds because they're not hedge
funds, they're more like LSEs.
But 23 of them that he owns, Wilbur Ross owns, okay?
Bank of Ireland hid $35 billion in promissory bonds, sorry.
He bought a portion of that bank for 1% for like,
like something so touchy, like a couple billion dollars.
And his, that share gave him access to $35 billion,
which he pulled out, and it's fucking amazing.
It's amazing.
So look, I get shit like that,
but then I get the weird spy people, you know?
Like the crazy people, they're not crazy.
They're, sometimes they're reading a script.
Like, I don't know if they're intelligence
from corporate intelligence,
or if they're actual state-run intelligence.
I can't tell.
Like this guy, Kaiser Soze, right?
So he's, he did a very classic move where you,
instead of going right for me, he goes to people around me,
and then they start talking about,
and I'm like, oh, who's this guy you're talking about?
Right?
And that's how I get hooked.
And I saw that coming a mile away, right?
So I was like, okay, I'm here.
What do you want to say?
And he won't tell me who's really moving.
And he goes into this story, it's very specific,
and it's very good, and I really wish it was true,
but I don't believe it is.
But I do believe that 60, the 40% of it,
somewhere over this bridge of the 50% market, is true.
It makes sense.
Trump, there was a meeting in Deutsche Bank,
he says, when my father was there,
and he, it's a lie, my father was never there.
I checked his schedule, he did not go to this meeting.
And Jurgen Fitchison was not there either.
He claims he was there.
And two people from Natsutzky were there,
and he was one of them, right?
He says that they came in to buy a silo,
which is a collateralized loan obligation.
It's basically a structured product.
It's a, it's a whole shitload of mortgages
put together into one bundle that you can buy.
And it's like a bank-to-bank thing.
You can't, it probably gives no access to it.
So they thought they were gonna get rid of this,
this charge, and sell it to Natsutzky.
And the guy said, well, the problem is,
we don't want you to buy it, we just want you to look at it
and tell us what you think.
And tell us before you see the problem.
So they looked at it and they saw that,
to make this long story short,
Donald Trump did not sign a consenting agreement.
Okay, so if you have a,
if you guys are all in a trust, right,
that means that you're all shared,
it's sort of the money that's pooled together.
Let's say you wanted to borrow $5 million
to start a golf course, right?
But you don't tell these guys.
You take it, you take the $5 million,
you don't tell them,
and you don't sign a consenting agreement.
If you fail, they have to pay your debt, right?
If you sign a consenting agreement,
then they're free, right?
They're not liable for your debt if you fail.
But you made money,
you bring it back in and put it in the pool,
and everyone's very happy, except that you didn't,
they overlooked the fact that you didn't sign this agreement.
Now, Trump didn't sign three of them, right?
Which means the people at Deutsche Bank
and the high net worth individuals at DBTCA specifically
will be very upset to know that,
and it would cause them to run on DBTCA.
Now, and DBTCA has $23 billion going for it,
and they still don't have a fucking chief risk officer,
all right, $23 billion.
That is a 700 person entity, all right?
There's 25,000 Deutsche Bank America,
700 people in DBTCA.
It's very secretive, it's a weird place,
and that's where my dad,
that's where they put my father when he died,
when he killed himself.
There's a French guy that runs it,
and he was supposedly at this meeting as well.
Now, I'll just, fuck it, I'll just tell you.
The first guy is Rebolyev, signed off on the loan, okay?
The second one is, I don't believe him,
because I fed him the answer, and I fucked up.
You know when you say, oh, did you hear the word
Victor Bexelberg in the room?
He goes, oh yeah, that's it, right?
Fuck, I shouldn't have said that, yeah.
So he claims Victor Bexelberg was number two,
and number three is interesting,
I didn't believe him until yesterday,
because something interesting happened yesterday.
He said that Spare Bank signed on behalf,
a person signed on behalf of Spare Bank,
not anyone you've heard of, but as,
sorry, I'm sorry, not Spare Bank, Gazprom.
Gazprom is an entity signed off on a loan.
I'm like, what the fuck, how can an entity
sign off on a loan?
I've never heard of that.
Until yesterday, when this Irish guy I was telling about
sends me a, they call it charges,
they call it in Ireland, they call them charges mortgages,
right?
He sends me this, I have it right here if you wanna see it,
this charge of some land that was sold in Ireland
by Deutsche Bank.
So Deutsche Bank, as a bank, is an entity liable for it.
I was like, holy shit, it does,
and that's very, I've never seen that before.
And he asked me, I've never seen this before,
and I have not answered him yet,
I'm not gonna tell him yes, you know,
because I don't know who the fuck he's doing,
where his game is.
He's telling me that he wants to find a proper journalist,
he wants Roman Farrell, so I'm like, okay fine,
here's Roman Farrell, give him a Roman Farrell,
but he's still sending me documents, so I don't know.
And it's, things like that happen a lot, so, yeah.
So what do you wanna, like, you know,
economic fraud type stuff, it's good information.
If that's the case too, we'll probably pass it to
an economic fraud agent, if you can help out too.
That's right.
What other, like, are you involved in any hacking groups?
Do you know of any hacking groups that you can get into?
Like, yeah, a dark net type thing.
Well, I mean, is this like, what if I say yes, am I in trouble?
Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's one group.
Because obviously the FBI monitors a lot of these things,
and you like to see, you know, what's going on.
Yeah, you guys are in that signal group, aren't you?
What signal group?
Which one?
There's a bunch of signal groups.
There's one, I know there's some people that we checked,
and there's some like, brand new,
limited identities for some people,
we don't know where they came from, so.
I thought it was either FBI, or it was like,
some spies or something, so I don't know.
In the signal group, so the signal group,
there's the less than you would get?
Well, it's not, there's a couple of,
more than one signal group, so there's a group of people,
and they're not all hackers, it's like,
it's a mix of very interesting people.
Yeah, yeah, it's like, some of the greatest journalists,
and some of the greatest hackers,
and some of the greatest activists,
some of the greatest writers, you know,
and some just fucking fine, interesting people.
You know, everyone's having a conversation,
but specifically a hacking group, no.
But there's like, different variations of these signal groups,
and this one is Barrett, so.
When he said Houston, I was like,
oh fuck, he's after Barrett Brown.
Barrett's on the radar, I mean.
Yeah?
Like, but you know that, I mean,
he's been arrested already.
I know, he's in rehab right now, yeah, okay, good side, yeah.
Well, what's Barrett up to, do you talk to him?
Yeah, I talk to him all the time,
he pisses me off, he's a little fucking shit,
because he's supposed to write great,
huge, thunderous story against Val versus David Enridge,
but she got too high, and just fucking forgot about it.
Well, not forgot about it, just didn't do it.
So, and he hasn't even apologized yet,
so I'm very pissed off.
And I've got reams and reams of texts with him, so, yeah.
And he's a good guy, but he doesn't know shit about computers.
He's not an hacker.
He's a pharmacist for a good day.
Yeah, but he's a talker, he's not an hacker.
No, you barely know how to do that.
You couldn't find his key chain.
You couldn't do his key chain.
Seriously, he doesn't know shit.
That's the funny part about Barrett,
he doesn't know anything about computers.
Yeah.
So, just, like, sort of,
what part of you have Barrett about?
No, no, no, he's, you know, just,
he's kind of like, the reason I have some respect for him
is because he's sort of, like, on this vengeful path
that I understand now.
I've never been on a vengeful path before,
but now I understand it, I've started it,
and I know that's what he's doing too.
Like, whatever happened with the FBI and him.
But I don't know, I just think it's hilarious
when he got raided and he was live on the webcam.
I just thought that was funny, I don't know.
But then he fucking, I told him,
I actually recorded this conversation,
I told him, like, look, dude, where you fucked up
is where you went after the FBI agent's family.
That was stupid.
You must understand how dumb that was.
Yes, but, you know, I was already
gonna be put in jail anyway,
so, come on, bro, you could have avoided a lot of shit
if you just didn't do that stupid shit.
So he's an ego that won't,
that's his biggest issue, his ego.
He can't drop it for a second.
He doesn't have the humility or the ability to try.
That's the problem.
That's why you can't trust someone like that in here.
Do you guys part of the top over signal?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, again, I was trying to help him.
He had no, he's like homeless now,
with his weird girlfriend, so I was trying to help him.
You know, I got him a couple of hotel rooms,
I sent him some money, he was like, you know,
and then my girlfriend goes out of her way to,
sorry, now I'm just complaining, but she goes,
out of her way to get him a place to live
for like a month, so he's off the streets,
he doesn't have to worry about food and shit,
he can just work, because she's like,
do the thing where he fucking promised he promised us,
like, here's a place to live.
And instead of just going there and saying thank you
and doing it, he just like,
creates this whole chaotic thing of like,
well, you didn't tell me to call this day,
and you know, like this minutiae,
so he sabotages the whole thing,
and then at the end of the month,
you know what, very, go fuck yourself.
I don't, it's not opening anymore,
the windows closed, it's done.
And he's like, fuck you, I'm very, you know.
No, and I ignore him, the more I ignore him,
the more he wants your attention.
We're seeing it right now,
I mean, where in rehab, is it down or?
Do you really want to know?
I was just curious, I mean, like.
You're like, what?
No, maybe, you don't want to tell,
you don't have to tell.
No, I, I, I think it's important,
I think I want to know what and why.
Like, if I'm going to take the accountability
of doing something to somebody here,
I'm just going to get in trouble if we're in jail,
I would like to know who it is,
why I'm doing it and what for it.
You know what I mean?
I get it, I mean, I'll tell you this right now,
I can't tell you everything we do, right?
Like I said, I'll be honest with you
as much as you're going to be honest with me.
I can't tell you the motivation behind
every single question I ask,
because there's a lot of things that the FBI does,
like if we had an investigation into whatever,
I don't know, call it Barrett Brown, for example.
And you want to know why, and it's because,
oh, we're going to arrest him tomorrow, right?
And then you don't say, hey, Barrett, by the way,
meet you in the FBI, I'm going to fuck you tomorrow.
Yeah.
It probably wouldn't go well for us, right?
So that would have to be my choice, right?
Yeah.
So everything you could tell is totally up to you, right?
Like I'm not forcing you to give anything,
you're here on your own.
Well, I'm not going to give you a Barrett Brown right now.
If there's something that he's done
that you feel you want to know,
or if this is a Vendetta thing,
then I don't want to be part of the Vendetta.
Don't worry about that.
I mean, I'm trying to assess what information you have,
because whenever he's up there, I'm in Houston, so like.
Sure, you know, I've got a Jeremy Hammond,
Greg House, all the guys, all these people.
Because like that's the other thing we have to assess too,
is if you're not willing to help.
But Greg worked with you, Greg worked with you already.
Greg worked with you guys.
He's already been helpful, you know.
Yeah, yeah.
Like that's the thing is we're collecting
a lot of information on a lot of different things, right?
Right.
So part of it is, it's going to be a one-way street
of information this way.
I can't give you all the information that's,
so like if that's what you expect, then, you know,
it's no hard feelings, and we part ways, and it's just fun.
Because I can't tell you everything we do, because.
I know, I don't.
You don't know me, I don't know you either.
I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.
I don't.
No expectations, I just, if it's something that is,
if I mean, I'm going to be accountable for someone's life,
I'd really like to think it through, you know.
Yeah.
I mean, if you want me to blindly follow orders.
I mean, I will right now,
because Marla's life is in jeopardy, of course.
I'll do whatever the fuck you want to save Marla,
but at a certain, after that, you know,
I will have to draw a line or something.
And I, so here's the thing,
I want you to be as conscious of the decision.
Let's take Marla's whole way out of the situation.
Okay.
And you resolve Marla, everything's both static.
I want you to make the same decision as her then,
as you would before that.
Okay, well then, that depends on you.
If I like you guys, and I believe that this is,
you are like Tim and Jammy, and like you, again,
if they told, sent you to me, then I'm trusting them.
I believe you guys are the good people,
because there are some bad people in the FBI.
All right, there's some really fucking shits.
In every, not just the FBI, but everywhere.
And it's hard to find them and negotiate.
And you know, my read on you right now
is that you're a very highly intelligent guy.
You know, but you're hiding something from me right now,
and you haven't still,
you still haven't told me you're hiding something right now.
And you are here to suss me out
from a totally different point of view.
I'm not sure what point of view that is.
And you are here to completely give
the female point of view.
Oh, wow.
I'm joking.
You have a whole other case that you need help on,
which is not even related to this,
but I'm trying to figure out what that is for.
But you seem more like a New York-style person,
not an LA person.
So I'm thinking you've got to be,
you've got to be closer than Tim,
and you've got to be with Desky and Lyne.
No, not with Desky and Lyne.
Anyway, so, but your thing's unrelated to their thing,
right?
My clothes?
Okay.
You're completely on it, like,
right before off of those, it is.
That's okay, but that's what you tell me,
and then I,
So, it's a matter of thinking.
I'm trying to assess you.
He, he, he, he.
The wrong thing is,
the people are being straight up.
Yep.
I mean, I think underlying related,
you know, they're wrong,
and we do this job for the right reasons.
There are bad apples out there,
and that's not what you've got across.
That's right.
I think the fact that when we listen to you,
and we ask you questions about model,
that's not a concern, you know?
That's not even worse than having a family to report.
And you've been through that.
You know, you have a history.
I have,
but I have to also question you and think,
well, you know, I mean, I could be any way,
what if I'm the bad guy,
and I'm sitting here talking to you.
So do you have to figure out,
where am I,
am I the good person or the bad person, right?
I told you my side of the story.
Of course, I'm gonna make myself look good.
You guys have to do your background on me.
So I figured, have you already done it?
If I would not be sitting here,
if you hadn't done it,
I'd already figured out I was the good guy.
So I'm gonna have to trust you on that.
That's what I,
now I could be jumping to conclusions here,
but that's why I figured it is happening, right?
So you're right on that part,
because I wouldn't bring you in here
in a situation like this,
if you were my target, right?
If you were my target, you were the rest of you.
Right, right.
That being said,
we're still trying to figure each other out, right?
Yeah.
We need to figure out what our role is,
and we're trying to figure out
if you've got any information that can help us.
So, what, oh, databases?
Yes, I do have OCCP,
and I did have all of MLA stuff too,
Hunter.Log, actually it's still available,
Hunter Archives.
Okay.
And the ICIJ,
and I've got,
I don't know, so that's the OCCP and,
what's Hunter?
If I could show up for a second,
I'd have admin access to you.
This is really good.
I got all the shit that I,
it was OCCP, yeah, thank you.
If you want my files,
you've been helping me up with your admin access.
I want to sell this shit, you know?
I can't be stuck looking at half the document.
If you want me to find the fucking money laundress,
you need to see the whole breadth of the thing.
I have to file the whole paper trail.
So, that's it.
So, what do they have on OCCP?
I've heard about it.
So much shit, so much shit.
Dude, it's great.
It's great, everything, everything.
Every, I mean, all my papers, you know, everything.
All my shit is there, you know?
All of MLA stuff is there.
So, Hunter Archives would be the OSC for MLA stuff.
And then that's what we got.
It was rated in Germany and one in America or something.
Which is a shame,
because it was like a public service at Archives.
It was really good.
But it's like a, that was her big coup d'etger out there,
her big tiara on her head sort of thing.
What's the word I'm talking about here?
Her baby or what?
Yeah, whatever it is.
But it's also, that's like one 20th of the OCCP.
Who's at the best of what's the important?
You know, I don't think she's important.
Actually, I think she's full of shit.
She says, oh, we used to work for the CIA,
but I can't tell you.
Like one of those old, you know, isn't that community?
Did Emma Bester reeling or?
I don't know, okay.
All I know is that I think she is a,
I'm still trying to figure out,
in that, you know, in any pejorative manner.
But I think she was a man first,
and then became a woman, or was she a woman who became a,
I don't even know that.
I just know it's some sort of gender change.
And I know that her boyfriend or girlfriend,
I don't know if she was also a man first,
but I do know that he slash she is kind of an asshole,
and that's it.
It's like the kind of person that asked for money,
and then, like, we need money,
we need help because we have an autistic child.
And how do you say no to that?
You know, but then they sort of say,
go fuck yourself if you have an idea that they don't have.
Like in this one group,
but a friend of mine was just trying to actually bear it.
I was like, yeah, you know,
what do we do, don't attack this person at this turn,
that this,
I'm sort of a lawyer that I can't think of.
I'm using my speed here,
but a nonprofit, some sort of nonprofit,
don't attack the specific lawyer because he's a good guy.
And then she says, fuck you, he's a terrible guy.
You can attack whoever the fuck I want.
And this is Emma's partner, it stops.
You know, they're, they heard his or anything?
Zen, is there a fake name, X-A-N?
No, X-A-N.
Yeah, but I think she's, like,
it was a whole, it's a dramatically stupid,
but it's like, but there was this whole drama yesterday
about she's working in a diner and she got sad
and she started crying, she couldn't contain her feelings,
and it was all melodramatic, and like, so what?
What are you trying to say?
If you want money, just say, can I have money?
Because we will respect you more
if you just come out and ask for it.
Instead of telling us how sad you are,
but you have to work in a diner, right?
If you say, fuck you for saying that,
and that's the sort of, no, I don't mean it, right?
You just want it back?
Yeah, yeah, you know, it's like, it's enough.
You want money?
Yeah, you know, and, yeah, so.
So is it saying a hacker or is he just doing
one of these, yeah, to be honest with you, okay.
I, so I felt like I hacked Deutsche Bank,
although I didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
I felt like I did a pretty good job of hacking it,
not directly, I didn't go into their servers and do it,
but I fucking hacked that bank.
And it, well, not maybe in the sense of a hacker,
you probably, if you're a proper hacker,
you would not see it.
But in social engineering and all the people,
when McKaylee Faisola went to jail,
I put the fucking bail, too, all right?
I got all the data, exposed everything,
and there's still more to come,
which you don't know about, all right?
There's a lot more to come, yes.
So I, so when Emma's guy, I forgot his name,
the Wolfsack, the Spanish guy, hacked the Cayman Islands,
right?
That was a great one, by the way, it's good stuff.
What happened with Cayman?
I just don't know about it.
Well, for me, it was on this, you don't know about it?
It was here, right?
Yeah, yeah.
I missed it, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's great.
That's definitely hacking news.
No, I guess this guy was on the service for like a year,
and it was just, I think he took all the Bitcoin,
like all of it.
And so he said, hey, anybody out there hack a bank,
I'm gonna give you $100,000 of Bitcoin.
So I'm like, you know what?
Hey, Emma, could you tell your friend,
I think I deserve at least a run-in
for this $100,000 in Bitcoin,
because although I did not hack Deutsche Bank,
that's why I'm trying to work.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And so Emma's like, no, you didn't,
you didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
but she didn't say, oh, let me pass on the message.
She didn't say, oh, hold on a second,
she just immediately responded as if she was the hacker.
So I suspected that it's possible that she's the hacker.
I've always thought she was,
because I always ask her.
Like I'm incriminating myself,
but I'm constantly asking like, Emma,
can you figure out how to do this?
Can you hack this shit for me?
Because I can't get past this point, you know?
Like with the, for example, David Enrich,
we have so much more, oh, this would be something
maybe you could help me with.
So many efforts and incriminates him
with so many fucking terrible things that he's done
and all the shit he's done for me.
It was all in signal.
And I took my phone to get the screen fix at the Apple Store
and I said, whatever you do, do not reset the phone.
And the fucking, the hacker has reset the phone.
And so I lost it all.
But I think it's an iPhone's success,
so it's not irretrievable.
It's still on the fucking phone.
But I cannot get the keys.
I don't know how to get the fucking keys yet.
It's been the slowest thing I've ever learned.
But I've got the tar ball, I've extracted the messages,
but I cannot get the fucking encryption keys
because I can't find them on the phone.
That's where I'm stuck.
It's like, that was, well, Alconov.
iOS, Frenzik edition.
iOS, Frenzik, it's just toolkits.
iOS, Frenzik, toolkits, it's a quick thing to do.
I mean, at least from my experience,
Alconov isn't like a great novel with Frenzik utility.
Like, I've played around with it, but I didn't use it because,
like, they don't automatically decrypt stuff
because, like, most normal Frenzik's programs do.
Really?
All right.
I'll talk to you about the free one.
Autopsy?
Is it good?
Autopsy's not bad.
I mean, that's a free one that anyone can download, isn't it?
It's a bunch of other ones that, I think,
a better job than Alconov.
Yeah.
I just, well, it's because I spent the money.
You know, it's having expenses,
so I feel like I have to learn it.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Another company that kind of delved into mobile,
it does just my opinion.
No, no, no, you're right.
They're really famous because of the thing with the photographs
in 2015, right?
So, like, they're kind of, right in their hotel,
now they have a mobile Frenzik thing that they're like,
well, if we put this out and they trust their name,
then we'll use it.
But, just from my experience,
I just haven't had much success with it.
Did you try Axiom?
I used Axiom.
What do you think of that one?
That's not bad.
It's a lot of good functionality.
Yeah, it's pretty strong.
Yeah.
It's very good.
So then I figured out you can just get pre-trials,
if you just say you're extending the pre-trials.
But yeah.
So you think that Beth is, she actually is a NSA, CIA?
No, I think it's worse than full of shit, yeah.
But do you think that she's a hacker?
I do.
I personally, I do think so.
I know no one else seems to be sure of my thing,
but I do think that she's a hacker.
I'm always trying to ask her to do it for some help,
but she's the one that introduced me to Elkheimsoft.
I said, I have this problem with the signal messages.
What do you recommend?
She said, Elkheimsoft, ILS, forensic.
What do you mean, Jimmy?
I don't know.
Again, again, right, it's too open-ended.
And she texted me the other day.
She's like, if you've spoken to FBI,
I said, no, I'm not speaking to FBI.
She's like, well, are you sure?
I was like, well, I'm not lying to you.
I was talking to the FBI, like, you know,
I will let you know when I speak to FBI.
So I go, well, you're kind of known as an FBI informant.
I said, well, fuck you, I'm not an informant.
I'm a source, like, help the FBI.
I do not inform anybody.
And then she's like, well, it's kind of the same thing.
And then I had to go on an entire raid
to explain how it's very different.
So we'll let you know that she is probably,
and also yesterday, one of my friends, Andrew,
had to defend me on this group as well,
because Xan was saying, your friend
with a well-known FBI informant, which is me,
which is another illusion to me.
So it's Xan.
Oh, Xan is telling you.
Xan's the partner of Emma.
So she's saying to who that you're a friend of mine
in our group.
Oh, so your friend is, Xan is acting your friend
for being friends with you?
Yes.
Oh, OK.
Sorry.
Exactly.
OK.
I mean, it's obviously a little different,
and I don't know if you understand.
This is weird drama.
It's like, yeah, there are many people with a group like that.
I think this, you know, I'm like 96, I think.
Oh, wow.
That's why it's too many people.
And there's too many lurkers, and there's too many new
and fresh, like, mid-dag identity,
so there's already a bunch of substratas,
and some groups are coming from that group.
And what's funny is they're all, well, I mean,
I'll tell you, it's not a big deal.
It's with all Barrett's friends.
Barrett's so, like, it's so weird.
I don't know how he does it, but he's, you know.
Because you might, of the 96, you might know how many people
in real life are in that group.
Like, women in real life.
Well, I guess, like, who they really are.
Oh, I know about half of them.
Yeah.
Like, into the other half, or like, lurker or something.
Yeah, but we have people that try and check them out
and figure out who these people are.
Like, once in a while, you'll get it right,
and we can serve it, you know, coming in there
and trying to spout a bunch of crazy shit, and kick him out.
And then, I noticed, someone loses a phone.
Like, it happened recently, and then all of a sudden,
we have to, it's been compromised, the FBI's in.
I'm sure you, was that you?
I don't know.
Was it you?
Okay, somebody.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know, somebody.
Oh, and that, oh, shit, wait, I'm Junco.
Did you call Barrett?
I think he recorded a phone call with you.
I hadn't called Barrett.
You hadn't called Barrett?
There was a different FBI agent that was trying to,
he was going to, I think it was some white racist,
nationalist fucking weird shit.
And he was someone else who was working, white racist.
Yeah, he used to know, but I remember the name
of Junco actually rings a bell.
And I was, I was going to tell you the other day,
but I had to figure out what it was first.
But now I just remembered again, I probably
should not be talking right now and saying it out loud,
but I am.
But there is something, there is something,
something secret.
Secret is going to be right now.
Okay?
You don't know who the person is.
Were you there?
He's only, he's the one who realized?
No.
Does he know Barrett?
Have you got him in question?
I know, I know, I've never met a person.
Oh, well, I mean, I have met, yes,
there's a few people I know first,
but I can't, like my friends, I'm not gonna tell you, yeah.
Getting a sense of the group, like, any other.
Let me show you, like, the most recent thing.
Let's see.
Ooh, someone's trying to,
Hey, you guys, who's trying to hack me now?
You got a thing?
No.
Don't click on the link.
What was it? What did you get?
No, I just got one of these things.
I think it's my girlfriend.
Who's using the other computer?
Oh, he's.
No, that's not what that says.
That's my girlfriend.
He's finding it really fucking awesome.
Yeah, I know.
It's, like, it's funny enough, the other computer
is Gwen Simpson's.
What was that?
Yeah, it was the Fusion GCat.
The Steal Dacian.
I mean, like, there's a lot of stuff
that I probably shouldn't know,
but I just don't, I mean, it's kind of like.
You didn't follow the Steal Dacian?
The whole Trump Russia?
No, I didn't know about it,
but, like, I didn't follow that much.
Anyway, I said, I lived at his house for a while,
at Gwen's house, yeah.
And he didn't pay me half the money
he was supposed to, so I took the computer.
Wait, is that, yeah.
Oh, and yeah, and there's a whole Russian spy thing
going on, too.
What's the Russian spy thing?
So there's, so I was telling Tim and Jami as well,
but they're sort of, they're things, so I don't know.
Am I supposed to mix things together?
But if Tim's aware of it, like, I would use the hot tin.
Let me tell Tim first.
Let me tell Tim first.
Okay.
Well, I should ask him if it's okay
Yeah, I mean, if Tim already knows about it,
he would, like, I don't worry that type of stuff either,
so, like, I would just tell someone else to.
Yeah, would he, would he tell me the, uh,
interior or the exterior?
Like, like, what, the United States
or outside of the United States?
Are we looking for a Russian hacker
or are we looking for a, everything?
Yeah?
Dude, that would be fun for me.
I would like to catch people.
I like, I can, I can do that.
But if money, the money is my specialty.
That's what I'm, better than the hacker.
Cool.
All right.
Do you need to send someone for something?
Oh, yeah, sorry.
No, I just got, I need to eat something.
My brain is...
You don't think you're gonna eat something?
Yeah, could we take a cigarette break or something?
Is it okay?
Yeah.
Yeah?
All right, let's do it.
What do you want?
No, no, no, I just...
Yeah, I want sandwiches, then.
Really?
Yeah.
What kind of sandwich?
A sandwich or...
Okay.
Sure, well, yeah, I'd love one.
Gratsen, that's nice.
I'll put on a mask or whatever.
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
What was I gonna show you?
At the time, you're...
Look, I don't know allegiance to these guys at all.
I mean, they've just, they've become sort of friends, but,
you know, as much as you can have a friend on that,
that doesn't tell you anything about that, right?
It's just sort of fun, more fun sort of.
Like, you're in the workplace,
you're not friends with all your workers, right?
No, I don't feel right for now.
Oh, yeah, I'll hit the head, you know where it is, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
You guys are just gonna go...
But I'll wait for you, because you can't fit out.
Oh, that's right.
So what's your specialty?
No, same, but I just happened to work in this office.
In this office?
Right, so, if you say, like, laundry.
Yeah?
Of course, he, you know, he flew here to speak to you,
so let him, let him, yeah, yeah, he flew here yesterday.
I didn't know it was just for me,
I just thought he was coming here
and I wanted to speak to you while he was here.
Yeah, so, for me, like, when you're in management,
I'm like, oh, okay, like, a lot of these guys on the floor
do, like, business email compromise, and a lot of guys,
like...
Did you, what?
I didn't hear you.
Business email compromise?
Oh, really?
Yeah, I don't know, okay.
That's easy, yeah.
Yeah, so, business email compromise, and then...
Is that a term for it?
Just business email compromise?
There's a, I didn't know there was a term for it.
Yeah, so a lot of things out of Nigeria,
and it's just funny, when you mentioned
you're not lobbying, is there a thing like...
Yeah, one of our guys over here,
they just got someone out of, like, Dubai,
or something like that.
Yeah, okay.
Cool.
And they're digging into that versus something like,
they're special to you, like, laundering,
laundering money, right?
So, like, romance, victim, romance scam victims,
like a victimized...
Oh, yeah, I heard that.
Eventually, he gets out to, like, Canada, China,
or all these other countries,
and there's, like, a whole money mule network
that's, like, pretty tough to...
Is it really?
Is it like a company?
Is it one person behind it, or is it...
No, no, no, it's all a loose connection, yeah.
Loose.
Interesting.
It's like a, like, a lead in welding connections
sort of thing, like, there was a...
Basically, like, very, very...
And they all know each other in person,
that's the difference.
Oh, they do?
They know each other, it's like,
oh, you know this guy?
He's leading, interested in, you know,
doing some work, opening bank accounts, and stuff like that.
Ah, I understand that, yeah.
So, like, they're friends in Nigeria?
Or in the community?
Shit, you know we did?
We had to, like, this lawyer was essentially an asshole.
He said, we need your narrative to store ACP for Monday.
So, I went on the Fiverr, and I tried to find it.
Oh, Fiverr.
It's a narrative of Marie's story.
Fiverr.
So, I went on Fiverr?
Oh, sure.
I went on Fiverr.
Really?
I found someone to do a live transcription
and it's a Nigerian guy.
He wanted to be paid in Bitcoin yesterday or tomorrow.
And Marie says, no, I'm not gonna pay you that.
And then he says, okay, and that's it.
So, I'm thinking, well, he just got all of Marie's
information since she was a child.
So, he should probably pay the guy, right?
It's a new scam, I think.
You're doing transcription services,
get your private data, and then sell that data.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nigerian's committing fraud.
What do you mean?
Like crazy, you know, connoisseurs, yes.
I mean, they're in that rush, they're doing good stuff.
Why isn't that, why is that the hotbed here,
criminal activity?
I don't know, it's what's called like training, you know?
Training stuff.
You're gonna wait here real quick?
Okay.
You think they train each other and like,
you know, it's like, hey, you know,
you grow up with all these people and like,
hey, you want to make a cash and then they say,
all you gotta do is you send out these emails,
there's this script and whatever,
and then they teach other people.
It's like any other criminal organization.
That's the way it works, it's all good.
Right now, I guess they're,
I haven't been looking around right here,
but they're like in protest right now?
Oh, really?
I don't see anything, so Pat's gonna cut it off.
I'm gonna say there's no, like,
see any signers or whatever.
Yeah, that'd be bad.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, I don't know why that.
Yeah.
Huh.
Where are they protesting?
There's the answer, you know?
Don't join, pal.
Don't do it, don't do it.
You guys get a bad rap, you know?
Like seriously, I was like everybody else
until I met Tim and Jenny.
Yeah.
And then I was like, you know,
I can't believe I considered you guys people, guys.
What are you doing here, dude?
You just being careful on me, yeah.
How'd you guys get started on this?
I don't know, I just started a little while ago.
I always wanted to do it as a kid.
Yeah?
Here I am, so I'm talking to Dad.
Did you good do the whole training
and either you taught you everything now
or did you know before?
Not much, not much.
Oh, for the computer stuff I went to,
my degree is in there.
Oh, it is?
I don't know about that.
I'm like, oh no, but yeah,
fan thing is I want to do it as a kid
and then easily enough, you just apply online, everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, so it's not like you know a guy or whatever.
No, that's cool, that's cool.
Interesting.
How lucky.
That's good.
Yeah, I'll give you a quick peep.
This is what it's like, you can scroll around.
It's not that, it's not a cool, great, crazy day
that I keep, it's not what you think.
Cool.
I'm not for rockin'.
What's wrong?
I'm not for rockin', it's business.
I assume these are not like real people, right?
No, they're not real people.
I mean, they're not their real names.
Some of them, I mean, I use my real name.
That's your friend.
I use his real name.
Oh.
I think Barry uses his real name.
Conlon, I don't know, kind of, Doc Rockett is a,
I can't remember, I used to read through it again.
I used to know what everybody was, but.
He's too many secrets, you know?
Oh, that guy's great, yeah, I do.
Let me tell them.
He doesn't do anything illegal.
He's like, he's just like a researcher.
He's not even that good.
He's got a couple of databases in there.
He's just very loyal and helpful.
It's a little, yeah.
So if anyone needs my help, I'll do that.
Kind of nice thing.
So there are no film crews outside,
but you never know.
They could show up to your comfort level.
Okay, let's go.
At the same time, the protest is like
about salons wanting to open.
That's what, salons?
Yeah, like salons.
Okay.
Cool.
Let's join.
A bit of a carry.
Oh, that's what we really did there.
Oh, thank you.
That was pretty good, though.
I mean, I give you credit.
God, it's split ends.
Okay, there you go.
So yeah, it's not that it's fun.
It's mostly just people yelling.
During like, you know, Joe,
I'm sure you know Joe Fiona.
Who's Joe Fiona?
Joe is like, what's his name?
Sub-Zero?
Sub-Zero?
What's his name?
I think in 2000.
I'm talking about the moral product character.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's his name.
He's alias.
He's pretty, he's a clever guy.
He was in the,
did you see the Hacker War film?
That's the film that women did with Barrett.
It's basically the guy that's talking all the time.
And wearing a suit, that guy.
Okay.
Joe, is he a hacker?
I think, yeah, he's like a, yeah.
Okay.
So he's like, he's friends with Barrett.
Is that how he got in the group?
Yeah, these old friends of Barrett.
Cool.
He's one of his old friends of Barrett, man.
So what did Joe do?
Joe, I'm not quite sure.
I think he goes cycling a lot.
He spends most of his time cycling
during the year.
He's a, everyone,
but these guys are fairly optimistic, you know,
based, which is great and all.
I'm not really a, you know,
I mean, I guess I don't believe anything that strongly
to go out and carry a sign.
Sure.
But I'm sure, you know,
I mean, if someone DCFS right now,
of course, I think I would probably carry a sign.
So I'm like, it hasn't hit me personally yet.
I mean, that's a really popular corner.
Yeah, wow.
Just because it's like one of the,
you hear it over there.
Yeah, this would be okay.
It's really far away.
I can push a little bit over there.
Sure.
Oh, really?
Oh, man.
So, yeah, I mean, just like everyone,
the people who use their real names
really aren't afraid of the guy finding out.
So, I'm sure you, yeah.
But the, yeah, there was another interesting thing.
God, I can't remember why they say code.
I'm running to show you the thing.
I can almost guarantee you.
It's not me, because I'm not that important.
No, but you were from Houston,
and Barrett said it was a guy from Houston
that called a friend of his
that was trying to infiltrate some group,
but he was on the wrong group.
I don't know exactly what happened.
We got a recording of the phone call.
I wanted to play back the phone call
to see if that was you talking to this other guy.
Not Barrett directly, but someone else.
I would be interested if you got a recording
of me talking to someone.
I love you.
I love you.
Yeah, that's what I said with the code.
Okay.
Now, could you, is it possible that,
is it possible to have this guy,
that you've done your research,
you probably understand that Steve is not a good guy?
He's Steve.
Steve Tolts?
You've posted here on Facebook.
Yeah, like he's not a stand-up guy.
He's not a,
you know the type that's run to mom and the scribbling.
Yeah, not yet.
I think it's actually really become a threat
to not only tomorrow's update with the priest,
the priest that's happening.
Sure, no, I get it.
Is it possible to have him reported?
No.
Australia.
I went to a whole moral crisis.
Did I do this or not?
And I asked them, they said they'd do it.
But then I said,
but then all of a sudden I had this father,
I said, we're not going to do that tomorrow.
That was the bottom line.
But that was last year.
Yeah, that was last year.
But now everyone's really asking me,
I know.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, good, good, good, good.
You're welcome.
I am the broker.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
You actually thought about it.
I was like, I'm not fucking one out.
I was like, you know,
don't look at me, I did it on the right.
I did, I did it on the right.
That's all I got.
It's a little bit economic.
Because I was shopping in one town,
and this was like twice that.
I'm like, if you guys really eat it,
I can eat for a week.
That's true.
I don't think you guys realize how nice this weather is
for August, whatever.
Do you know Andrews?
I don't like this weather.
Do you know Andrews?
Who's Andrew?
The one you pointed out, my friend.
Your friend?
Yeah.
I mean, you just told me about him,
but I don't know.
Before I mentioned him.
He's a good, interesting character.
What's the deal?
He's a really good guy.
Good dude.
Do you remember, maybe,
probably in 2015 there was this article
in Bloomberg about
if there was this company,
and it turned out later,
you find out articles later,
that it was a Russian company,
they created this big deficit for people.
Someone would call you and say,
you owe us $2,000 a month,
and then you say,
you got this thing,
you forgot about it,
you should probably pay it.
Most people will pay that money.
If you will just create this big debt,
and it's a really fucking dollar,
and it's $1,000,000 a month.
So a lot of people would take the manager,
and people would just be doing that.
And they'd try to get it to Andrews.
They wouldn't call Andrew,
and they'd say, you owe us $5,000,
we're a combination of debts,
and they'd say,
oh my god,
I remember paying that back,
they didn't really owe us.
So he starts fighting and arguing with this guy,
until the guy threatens to go
and create this company.
Like, totally possible,
and Andrew said,
that's it.
So he starts doing like,
he's now,
he's the Liam Neeson thing,
I have three,
you know,
a few good things,
whatever the client is.
And that's pretty good.
So you reverse engineers,
it's brilliant what he did,
I love it.
Reverse engineers,
everyone that's called him,
and looks him up,
there's all the background on them,
gets them to give up more information on their,
just like you could do in any case.
You know,
give information to the guy at mob,
and the hierarchy,
all the way up to Weldon,
the congressman,
was he a senator or congressman?
Well, I'm a senator or something.
Is he Weldon?
No,
Josh Weldon,
or is he something Weldon?
Yeah, man,
I don't know all the senators
who represented him,
so I'm a bad,
he's an ex-servant.
But,
I mean,
he might be,
he might be actually,
I know he's a congressman person,
but that's about the ex-servant,
I know.
Yeah,
but he's in bed with a lot of,
the Russian companies,
they're creating these fake debt companies,
and it's a really good story,
it's great articles,
and it's just sort of reverse engineers,
put some in jail,
and it's a good guy at the store.
It's very impressed.
That's cool.
I mean,
he found me,
he just wanted to know
if I had any data
on those people as well,
like,
I was looking for Weldon,
the Russians,
the Tudmento,
or some other guy,
and that's how we became friends.
He's a good guy.
That's cool.
I thought he was already working with you guys.
I'm pretty sure he was,
I thought he was CIA.
Okay,
I mean,
so if he was CIA then,
I don't think he would.
That's what I thought.
I don't know.
Have you ever been in the,
like,
okay.
Yeah,
he came out to visit.
I don't know,
do you think he'd want to work with us?
I think he would.
I think he would,
actually.
Do you want to give me his contact information?
I think I'd have to ask him.
Okay.
And then,
if he'd never have to,
I'd bring it up.
Because I don't know,
he's like a,
like a really,
he almost pisses me off,
he's like,
too good.
He's like,
he reminds me of my father in the sense
of his morality.
He's very,
very strong.
That's good.
So that's the thing you guys like,
I mean,
you hire a lot of,
like,
Mormons, right?
So,
who's at the CIA?
Who's hiring all the Mormons?
They're doing a lot of good things.
Yeah, okay.
If they can pass the broadcast,
yeah.
Okay,
really the Mormons
can't pass the broadcast?
That's great.
Because they can't.
They cannot.
No, they can't.
Oh, they can't,
right?
Yeah.
Okay,
okay.
I mean,
the Mormons
a lot of time,
they do missions.
So when they go overseas,
they learn the language,
it's probably useful
for like,
CIA and all that kind of stuff.
Right,
good cover.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but it's so,
like,
we're so
strict with rules
and stuff.
How do you,
how do you,
justify one thing
or do something else?
That's a good question.
That's something
I've,
know nothing about.
Right.
Well,
being a Mormon
won't work for the agency.
Like,
how do you justify,
like,
a man,
a woman,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man,
a man.
What do you guys
do?
Jesus,
people?
Can't see that.
Okay.
Do it or not do it?
No.
I wish there was.
Yeah,
I wish there was.
Yeah,
I wish there was.
Yeah,
I wish there was.
That's what's more impressive, what you need for me right away is the thing that you have on your plate.
What I can help you with, what you can do with the transactional for M-[Redacted]'s safety.
I would like to bro it, Steve.
Listen to me, sir.
Thank you.
Seriously, it caught me up.
Are you happy?
Maybe.
You've got to take off that pavilion.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
I like the economy with our mayor.
That's right.
I'm going to watch out for the mayor.
I would have to be really secretive if I now tell the mayor.
I can't tell her everything.
What I don't tell her, she always finds out.
What would you tell her?
I'm going to tell her, oh they offered me a job.
I'd be like, what are they paying down?
Not money.
It's a good job.
But they will have M-[Redacted].
They should say, trust them.
You can live with them.
See that?
You're the mayor.
I know.
Me?
She isn't a super.
She'll see you working on it.
What are you doing?
Okay, thanks.
I'll see you later.
It's fun to do an episode 7.
But I don't know how people will know.
I figured it was okay to do an episode 7 today.
It was a bit rainy.
But she said it was not.
It was a lot.
A lot of stuff was in French.
Which brings me to a good point.
So I was afraid to look at it.
I don't understand what it meant.
Just to take a look at it.
I'm a hard guy, right?
That's concerning.
So that's why I just ran it over.
I'll forward it to you.
That's what I said to David.
I don't know.
I would really like to use that against him somehow.
I'm trying to do that.
It's legal for me to give him that.
But he does it with an afterward.
I don't know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's hard.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to say.
But it's definitely hard to do what he did.
So before the show, what's up with you?
You know?
You know what's really wrong?
You know?
I'm just a musician.
I used to play football and having...
Sorry, I didn't go to it.
I see.
And there was a guy who lived about me in London.
He lived in London for you.
He was really good at acting, with the transition.
He gave me a list of all that.
He addresses me.
He'd be a good guy.
He'd just have fun and see me.
You could tell that or something.
And he's the one who said,
I don't think it's going to be that bad.
And at times it's like $30.
I mean, I don't think it's going to be that bad.
I want to spend $30 on some bullshit.
I would have bought pizza.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, that was about the sound of it,
but I mean, I was really focused.
I have 36 hours to do the single.
It's been all my time.
A lot of work.
A lot of work.
You know, I don't do that anymore.
Really?
Do you miss it?
I mean, I miss lifestyle.
No.
I don't.
I don't have music,
but I think I do.
I don't.
Cross our lifestyle.
Yeah, but you got to stop at some points.
You can't be the other guy doing that.
Yeah, there's a lot of things.
It's not like it's still going on.
Yeah, but still, it's a little creepy.
We were at a party.
We didn't see what's happening.
What's the name of the meeting?
I didn't talk to him.
I was like, what's the change that you're doing here?
You just get out of rehab.
That's where he's supposed to not do it.
He's like, let's go get a drink.
And whatever.
It's all like rehab.
Things are supposed to not do it.
So, you guys,
we're having everything.
We got the idea.
There's a lot of rules.
We're not supposed to be that broad.
But first you're out.
You got laid and be manipulative.
Because we don't have your drugs here.
You're trying to compensate.
I don't know.
We'll never realize that.
So you're not allowed to date at all after rehab?
No.
So, you're on a graduation?
You'll get that certain tone of the dopey
that you don't have for your drug.
So, the relationship won't fill it up for you.
But you're always going to end tragically
because once you're speaking away.
It's like what you're going to do.
I'm going to act strong.
I'm going to act strong.
That's what I'm going to do.
We'll just talk about that.
You don't want to do it?
No.
It depends.
You want to or you want to.
If you just don't want to.
If you're stuck with it.
You have to.
I mean, I did.
Well, first of all, Muzza,
he's called Nick.
We need you to stay at this rehab
but we figure out everything
through your mopsie.
If you don't know anything about Muzza
or if you don't know anything about Muzza
you might want to stay out here.
I was banned from the UK for three years.
I've never stayed with him.
Nothing's relationship.
So, stay the year in the California
in this rehab.
We'll figure out the next move.
And that's when I realized
that I had to learn really fast
for my mother.
Well, the Buddha taught me.
She got my dad.
She threw out my dad.
Not the people, literally.
But he signed it.
But in the New York state
he agreed.
So, it's not up to her to throw that.
So, she landed in the fall of 2004
where she gets everything.
She's very smart.
And I didn't know anything about finance.
But she's doing something that's happening
where you can learn fast.
So, that's why I learned finance.
When you're desperate
and you have to face off
and get nothing to lose
you find like you have intelligence
and everything.
Really, everyone has it.
I think it's the current everybody.
If you can get rid of the emotion
because emotion sort of clogs you up
then you can get more free
and free of focus.
It's emotion that really blocks the emotions.
And emotion is important of course
but you also need the emotion to
connect with someone to understand
all the time.
You need to control it.
It's the greatest freedom.
Well, drugs.
Drugs help a lot.
When they train you, you can do it without drugs.
But at first, no, you can't.
But you're such an emotional mess.
So, you take the drug
which calms you down and makes you feel
like it's making you focus.
Like I was not crying.
I was not keeping my father.
And it's a reminder that
that part exists.
It's when you're pressing that existing
to get it back.
So, you just mind yourself that,
yeah, I was free one day.
So, you have it.
So,
you can then exchange it.
And you can actually say,
wait, is that
is that my thinking?
Is this you?
Is that my question for you?
Is this certain?
That's the purpose of this.
Help me if you can hear me.
So, if you can stop me,
stop me, stop me.
We do it with light speakers.
We have it.
We get it.
It's like it becomes instinctive.
My dad would stop me.
He's the one.
You guys never
trust your feelings.
Always trust your instincts.
Your emotions.
And there's a huge difference between
your feelings and your emotions
and your instincts.
What are you talking about?
Feelings versus questions.
Your instinct, I guess.
Your instinct is my emotion.
Your instinct is my reply.
It's like this danger is not in me.
This is going to serve me, not serve me.
I'm going to have to calculate it.
That's the risk.
I'm going to do the risk.
Let's see how sad it's going to be.
That's a year.
Our brains are so fucking
amazingly fast.
We calculate that.
And it comes out as an instinctive
instinctive man.
The emotion of the cloud,
you can see everything through this wall
that you're not wanted or not loved
or you're not wanted or not loved.
That's the way you're going to friend the world.
That's the emotion you want to love.
So focus on the world.
That's all they want.
You can do that.
Your dad just died.
My dad and my mother.
It was terrible.
I used to be
like a...
This is a country.
I didn't do that.
I didn't do shopping.
People did it for me.
All of a sudden, I'm looking at my car.
I don't know how to do it.
I don't know how to...
I didn't think I had it in me.
They did.
I don't know. We'll see.
We'll see.
It's another thing I'm not going to go there.
It's a party.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm fine.
It's been a few years.
Did you sacrifice?
No.
It's been a few years.
Not as good as this guy's.
Thanks a lot.
What did you do for a while?
For a while.
For a while?
Really?
For a while.
I was doing a different one.
We'll see.
We will do the same thing.
We will...
We'll do some research.
Development drugs.
Like...
We'll see.
Yes, yes.
I didn't do it.
Oh, it didn't happen.
Yep. We didn't all...
Be born in a...
Sorry, we weren't born in a...
We didn't all sort out...
You would do a different type of drug.
You would do a different type of drug.
You would do a different type of drug.
That's good.
That's good.
No, no.
It's kind of like using drugs.
That would be huge investments.
They are going to offer you that.
No, not anyone would.
That's like...
There's been a handle.
There's been a handle.
We have the FBI tries to fire
diversely
in terms of like backgrounds.
So we don't...
We try it.
There's a big pool of like...
I want to join...
I want to join...
I want to be in contact with...
I want to join...
The military.
We certainly don't want to be a
100% of that.
We don't want to be a general...
We don't want to be a general population.
We don't want...
We're going to get a fifth grade teacher
when I was in high school.
He also had a rocket scientist.
Just a lot of people.
I've had all over the world.
What was a fifth grade teacher.
They've heard of people together?
She's actually a good...
She's still a good agent.
She must be a people person.
She's very good people.
But she's also a very good...
and a lot of things that we had to do.
But...
You still have the Casanovas?
And it still exists?
Casanovas?
Is it Mars?
What's that?
Casanovas.
It's Mars.
Yeah, well, we don't know a lot like that.
It's a little thing.
No, it's like the old 60s.
You know, the guys who played, you get information.
Hello.
I don't think that's it.
No, I don't.
Maybe it's what's waiting for my time.
That's the 60s.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the...
You know, that's the limit.
They're working for us right now.
You guys get fired.
That's the same.
Do you know how many roles we have?
Like, half the stories of your complete bullshit.
But, you know, it's good that there's a myth out there
that people make you just sleep with whoever.
Maybe that's...I'm sure that's what some agents said.
It's like, no, no, no.
I'm recruiting you for some super secret mission.
All you gotta do is sleep with me.
Right.
You know, she's probably graduating.
It's like, I'm working for the FBI.
That's what I'm doing.
Oh, the good question, though.
You guys have unfettered access to, like,
the sort of the interagency software
where, like, if I wanted to go hack into your phone,
I would do it with a new camera.
Is there a reason why?
Still, there's not a reason why.
But there's a powerful cause to be able to use it.
Like, if I wanted to hack into your phone
and try your camera, would I need a passport?
Yeah.
Or is it, like, is it sure like now?
Is it in the world?
See, ten years ago, if you needed a passport,
it would be very qualified to get one.
But now it's adjacent to the point where you just ask for it.
No, it's way harder.
Really?
Should that, even that?
And just thinking theoretically is, like,
even harder to do.
Really?
Yeah, to an effect.
You're not, you're no longer searching, you're actively
buttering or flipping.
That's what happens.
Yeah, then that, like, a new turn.
Like, a turn on the camera.
What's the difference now in a guy sitting in a car
on top of a car?
Look, this thing can go places for some guy in a car here.
Which is...
In a car?
In a car.
In a car in your house.
Who's a guy in a car?
Yeah, I thought it was you guys.
See you guys?
We're in the triangle.
I don't think so.
There's some other interesting things to see.
You got a guy outside of the brewery.
So he's in the same place with the triangle.
And then every time he spots, I mean, it's a wave.
I thought it was you.
Might be, like, see a higher-department investigator
for all I know.
Maybe that, too.
Let's take a picture of the place.
Can I just run it here?
How would you run it?
Oh, I got some.
You got a guy.
That's the thing.
I got a guy.
You used to be seen in the improviser
and you guys know how to do it.
Oh, I know.
That is...
How do you put that?
Stuff.
I mean, you can't do it by yourself.
The level of this is not as much as it needs to be
to roll with the times and adapt.
Like, for example,
this whole encryption key battle,
like, you know, we've had previous leaders talk about,
like, what do you need to give up the encryption key?
But we all kind of know, like,
philosophically, that'll never,
and that shouldn't happen if it doesn't matter.
It's, like, a losing battle.
We're just going to, unfortunately, have to adapt.
If you just build a job, it's just going to be harder.
And then many, you know, like,
these old-school techniques
that, like, talking to people, like,
we're talking right now are talking to people
that are now way more, you know,
just sitting at your desk
and looking at, like, a pipeline.
So it becomes, there's a question figure
at work sometimes.
And, like, swaying back tomorrow.
And this is just me, but it should be hard.
It should be hard?
It should be hard.
It should be hard.
I agree a lot.
It should be better.
It's not the way it works.
It's the way it works.
There's nothing, there's no secret to it.
It's just that, you know,
I can find it when I want it,
but I don't really want it yet.
There's nothing I can do.
You can do that.
You know, I mean, I can do it.
I can do it anywhere in the world.
You know, once you get there,
you have to actually keep a secret from all of them.
That's a weird quote.
I don't know what to make of it.
You just have to adapt to it and accept it, I guess.
It's true.
It's just, like, you know,
good pre-LLCs instead of work.
You don't have your name on it.
That's beautiful things.
That's why it's a living dog.
You can have a fake name.
You can have a name.
Perfectly legal.
It's a good thing to do.
Jersey and all of Iowa.
Yeah, it's just like a state.
It's a state.
You know what?
It's very deep, very Jersey.
I think that's pretty sure.
Probably.
It's a good spot.
Thank you.
You want to go?
I'll go.
I'm trying to be right there.
Yeah.
Actually, I think if you prefer
an opera or a movie,
I think you can take it.
I think you can take it.
I really do.
No, I don't.
I think you can take it.
You can go to a opera or a movie.
You can go to a opera or a movie.
You can go to a opera or a movie.
You can go to a movie.
You know what?
You have to do it.
You have to do it right.
You can go to a opera or a movie.
You can do it right.
You can go to a opera or a movie.
You can do it.
You can do it.
You know what?
You can do it.
Okay.
I'm not sure.
I mean, I can't worry.
You can do it.
That's the thing I learned.
It's not, I can't, it's, it's all I'm learning.
It's not only me.
It's only freedom, too.
It's a freedom, you know what I'm saying?
It's worrying about a kid, and then everything is justified.
Everything is justified if it's for his safety.
You know?
That's the interesting part of it.
Where are you thinking about yourself all the time?
I don't know.
I think it's more because of the protector.
Yeah, or, uh, or...
I don't know.
There's a word for it.
You're a protector of someone.
Someone else's life is now.
Yeah.
Well, it's also pretty scary as shit.
You know, you're accountable for everything.
What if it turns out to be an accident?
Shit.
That's when you were like, that was the other person.
Shit.
Yeah, you're gonna have faith, though.
That's all for me.
Here you go.
Are you serious?
He's just searing in the sun.
Well, he's in his heart, right?
Yeah.
There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
What's that?
There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
And a trade-off and a trade-off.
It's really big.
The whole concept of oil contracts is really big.
Yeah.
The oil companies are very political.
There's a lot of other factors that you can think of.
Yeah?
Just political factors?
People that are just fucking...
I think everyone else is off.
Well, I think there's a lot of other things.
Peaks down around the whole...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't know.
People have issues with oil contracts.

Where positive positive 230 are set
where positive and positive C.
What are the odds,
What is theculрей to choose
Why do we need to do that?
Because we don't need to pay the money out.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.

It doesn't.
Yes.
It won't
It won't be big.
It can stand too low.
But it didn't end, obviously, I mean, it still worked.
Yeah, that's right, right now, but like, in a, oh.
Now it's 11.5.
11.5?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It dropped to...
It went up to 12,000.
It dropped to...
Yeah.
4,000.
At least then I could regulate it.
Do you like it?
At least a lot?
Well, yeah, I don't like it.
I just like to talk to you regularly.
Yeah, I still haven't tried it, you know.
I didn't expect you to do this, but you did.
You didn't have to decide what you wanted to try.
You just didn't know.
You didn't even know how to do it.
You just flashed in there.
You could be just pumping down.
Yeah.
I didn't want to say too much.
The whole Brickel-Prinsky arena.
I don't know.
I don't think you should say too much.
You're the last one.
You're the last one.
No, I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
No, I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.

I'm the last one.
I'm the last one.
I was the last one.
I'm the last one on my list.
I got the person.
So it's just been decided that there's noney for now.
How did you figure that out?
I just put the time last time I logged in.
I didn't log in. I wasn't going to log in.
What the fuck? I didn't log in the moment.
And what would they go for?
And then I took the last window.
They didn't even open.
I think I just sort of assumed it was a log file
because the windows were open.
But I actually don't really know what they thought.
I still think it could be gone.
When the gun thought I was by.
Glenn was a funny story.
So after the Bahamas,
he slides me back to his house.
At first I thought I was staying at a hotel.
He said, go to his house.
And it turns out I was at his house.
Why am I staying here?
It's too hot right now in Florida.
And it's too hot in DC.
You can't put your hotel in.
You've got to stay here.
Fortunately, my wife is gone on a vacation.
But you can stay in her room.
Her room.
They haven't slept in the same rooms
for like ten years.
So they're separated by the same house.
Okay, so I stayed in his room.
I was asleep.
I was so tired and I had some long flight.
And then I wake up.
And you know,
God save your cigarette.
He has this colonial house with this kitchen porch.
And I notice there's like a brick
in the screen window.
Yeah.
I sat there the last night.
I didn't call it a good story.
What were you doing at 2am last night?
I was asleep.
In bed.
No, you weren't.
I heard a car.
I saw you run to the car.
They gave him something.
What did you give him?
I didn't give him anything.
I have it all in video.
And it is this huge 1997 camera
that you know,
he has not updated its RAM systems.
Made by Nintendo.
Nintendo, yeah.
And so he starts going through his,
you know, his fast-forward
thing in his office.
He takes me to the office.
He's like, he's so
convinced that he's caught a Russian spy
in his house trying to get out of there.
Dossier just was published.
He's like,
he's out.
And then,
around 2am,
we see a hundred shadowy figure
approach.
Wow.
And I see it.
And I see the figures sort of stumble and fall.
And they stand up really quick.
And I look around and see the camera.
Glad he's a nice little kid.
He's strong, he's strong.
And you can't get into.
He's trying to slice the window screen.
The only window that doesn't have an alarm
is the camera.
No, no, Glenn Simpson.
He's going to be a Russian spy
when his son tries to sneak back in
for a party.
Still no apology.
You guys.
I appreciate that.
Well, anything else
that you think you might be able to help out with
is what I'm going to do is I've written down
a list of the stuff that
you see in Access To.
And I'm going to be able to do
some of the project stuff
that would be useful for someone.
I don't know.
I can do
emails.
Those are pretty easy.
Again, social engineering
I'm pretty good at.
When I get in that zone
and turn on the charm,
I can do fun,
actually enjoy it sometimes.
Actually, that would be fun.
If you need...
I've been focusing
just as like any concerned citizen,
but you guys have to be honest
so you don't have to answer the question.
I'm sort of Trump-based.
People come to me
with a lot of financial documents
from all over the world.
A lot of them are just...
There's a lot of hoops.
Some people like Ed from Ireland
is a legit guy.
The Catrice Jose guy
is some sort of state-run guy.
I don't know.
But I get a lot of that.
And then
there's
the Epstein thing with the sort of
a side gig for New York Times.
But I can
get that data,
but I did not want to take the step
to break in.
If you need me to do that, I'm happy to break in.
And if it's legal, and you guys are like
do legally, let's say
you can do this, I'll make that.
Good.
And it would definitely be something
we would tell you to do with a bunch of other caveats
and would not be allowed to do.
But...
Let's see.
Let me know if I missed anything too,
because I have
Tyler Rossi about MPS.
He did a man-in-the-mill for
eating from mom's computer.
You hacked the rich bank, but not really.
Right.
I still can, though.
I don't know if I'm
studying or I don't know.
If you ask me, you should not do any illegal activity.
That's probably the best
most of action.
No, I'm not going to know that for sure.
I'm not going to talk about that.
But hacking a bank
is just hacking the bankers.
That's true. That's illegal.
I wouldn't suggest it.
No, but I mean, in a case,
it would be something that you would want.
But can you really hack people like that?
It's not something
that we would normally do.
So, like,
it's good to know you have the skills, because we could
put you in a situation where you can talk to other people,
or we can introduce you to a group,
or do something else, and you're more complicated.
But knowing your skills is a good thing to do.
But it would be rare where I'd be like,
hey, go hacking a Deutsche Bank,
deal with this stuff for me,
because in court, that would be a hell of a thing
to show that the
government essentially hacked into a bank to deal with that.
Well, I know, but there's also
you guys, I'm sure you have people like this
in your agency, where other
agencies have the same types, where you find
an outside person like myself,
that you hire basically
to break the rules, but you don't say to break the rules.
You need someone that, you don't do that?
No. No?
Definitely. Okay.
I would tell you this, the rule is
if you were officially working with us,
you are an extension of the government
in the sense that if
you can't do anything I can't do.
Like a self-contractor.
Yeah, I guess you can kind of think about it like that.
You're not employed by the government.
But like, if I told you to
hack into something, it'd be like me hacking into it.
I can't do it, you can't do it.
Okay, so I'd represent,
who would you represent in the government?
Like, or...
Indirectly, yeah.
Like, you would give a...
You would be getting the direction from the government, too, which I mean.
It's like, there's a floor
or something.
The action is filled with government.
Right, right.
But technically, it's not, you're not,
it's not the government.
And who pays you is not the government either.
If you're an independent, who,
how do you pay it?
You mean, if you were to
be helping or something?
Sure.
Yeah, that's the government.
Which actually comes from the government?
No, it would be taxing.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
But, we don't hire people to break the law.
Like, to search ventricles.
Are there any...
I'm sure they do.
But that's Oklahoma's stuff.
So, like, oversees the rules are different, right?
Like, oversees your
committing espionage, which is by the fact,
you know, the fact that we're against the law, right?
Right.
And the United States, you know,
we're still bound by the Constitution.
So, like, one distinction I want to make, too,
is like, with the FBI, like,
we will follow the rules every time.
I'm never going to tell you to break the rule,
and like, don't tell me about it or something.
We'll never deal with that situation.
Make a win-win.
Never.
If I tell you something, like,
even if I ask you to talk about something
that could be considered as illegal,
I'll have a whole document of, like,
this is exactly what you're allowed to say,
this is what you're not allowed to say,
these are the communities,
and you can't deviate from these four corners.
Otherwise, we distance ourselves from you,
because it's not what we ask.
Okay.
So, because there's a lot of stuff about what the FBI is,
or is it?
Like, just from talking to you today, right?
There's a lot of stuff that
you've perceived to be as Jewish.
Oh, yeah.
I totally learned a lot today.
Yeah.
So, that being said, it's like,
if you work with us,
it has to be very clear
that you're not breaking any rules.
Right?
Because we also don't want to work with people
who are not going to be able to follow directions.
We talked about it, it makes sense to me,
but, like, if you're going to give us information, too,
we have to know that that is the whole fiction.
You can't, like, take part of it.
You can't omit the stuff
that you don't want to tell us,
and it also has to be everything.
Because if we find out that it isn't everything,
then we can't trust you, right?
Right, right.
So, you want me to hold back?
I'm like, Barrett.
If you ask me, tell me about Barrett.
So, that would be,
that would have to be what we have now.
So, we're not,
are we really bound to tell you everything I know?
Not really bound.
Here's the thing.
Can I make a mission based on what I think
is irrelevant and irrelevant?
Or no?
It depends, right?
I mean, like, here's the thing.
You're not going to be your only source of information.
That's not how to work either, right?
I'm going to verify what you say.
It's like I look at this stuff
and I'll try to figure out it.
It's like a report.
Yeah, it's like a report, right?
I mean, they're also investigators, so to speak.
They publish their stuff.
But, if you were to work with us, right?
What I need from you most is trust.
If I can't trust what you're saying,
if I can't trust you with the information I give you,
then there's absolutely no reason we would work together.
Right?
If we were to involve you in something
where you are involved with other criminals,
you say, hey, by the way, I'm working with the FBI,
that whole thing goes to put them.
Right?
I mean, it doesn't help us.
So that's why you allow this stuff, too.
If you're here to give us information,
it was partial information and it was admitted, right?
There's a part in the court called Discovery, right?
I'm not sure how it works.
So with Discovery, we have to provide everything to defend.
That's how every U.S. government works, right?
Everything that we have that we're using to prosecute this guy,
the defense gets a copy of it.
So they can prosecute any of your stuff, right?
Right.
It's getting illegal happening and they...
So in the case that if you gave us partial information,
we'd provide that to the defense.
The defense obviously knows the full story
because that's the one he's being charged.
They say, actually, I said a bunch of stuff
that is exculpatory.
In other words, stuff that shows that I was innocent,
but it was selectively filtered out.
Our whole case would go to shit.
That's a regular job of having this guy.
Exactly, right.
So just how it's not fair for Prasada to do that to you, right?
Right.
So as the U.S. government, because we are the U.S. government,
we play exactly by the rules, every time.
So is there a guy, a middle manager there, at some point,
that says, I decide what goes into this reporting
and what does not go into the court?
So it's not my decision.
I just give you all the data you ask for, right?
Without any omission, and someone else makes that decision.
Okay.
Yeah, it's usually the case agent who would be working with you
who would say, okay, hey, I'm going to write this report.
And we write it in a way that doesn't disclose everything, right?
Because if I write your name in my report...
Can I text your identity, but it's still...
It doesn't hide anything.
We'll often put you guys in position to make you look bad,
but, you know, try to get it.
Try to get it.
So anyway...
Cover your ass and get it.
Right.
That's just the general way we work with people
because we work with a lot of different people
in a lot of different areas of life.
Like, I work drugs and drug dealers on my account,
and, you know, we work with them.
Do we drug you there?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Because we've got to work our way into the chain.
How else do you think...
You can't just get the runners all day, right?
Right.
You get in the tenants and you get the people at the top
and try to...
Back down.
I don't care.
It just fucking has to happen.
It's completely...
It's completely...
Kind of like what we said downstairs.
It's hard, right?
It's hard to do this job,
but it should be hard.
Because of the rules?
Yeah.
I mean, the rules are hard.
Because that thing would be easy for us to do.
But we're with the new rules.
That's why we're going to do it with the new rules.
Because it's the right thing to do.
Is it like a chain of evidence or a thing?
Like, there's like a cartel.
You think, you know, there's a guy's IP address.
You know, there's email.
So now that, like, drug dealers are using,
like, the encrypted chat,
it doesn't work to go to the telephone company
and say, hey, we want to get a title-free on this cell phone
so we can see all the types of things.
That's all then in the water.
And now in order to get their communication,
like, you'd have to actually get a hold of the phone
and put...
And honestly, the way to do it is, like,
you'd have to get someone inside the group.
Yeah, close on.
Yeah, even then, like, you need someone to, like,
20 or 70 men in that phone.
Can it be an 8?
Yeah, I got it.
It still goes back to, like, that thing
where you have to get someone inside.
We can't just sit back and rely.
Yeah, because it's not...
It's because it's illegal to hack into the phone
and to bring it back in Christian.
So even with a proper warrant, you cannot...
Oh, yeah, exactly. With a proper warrant, you can't
because the technology is testing against that now.
It's not the technology itself.
But if someone can still do it, it's still doable, right?
Like, if someone was using some app that the data was still
housed with the service provider,
then, yeah, yeah, it would do it.
Because it's legally within the phone
and that company legally has the content.
Is it too much for me to ask, like,
what is legally outside the phone?
Well, you can even ask about that.
And it's just an hacking situation.
Like, if you know a cartel guy and you have a warrant,
what can you legally not do?
Yeah, I think maybe it's easier.
I'm just curious.
You can't break any law in order to get access to that guy.
Still the right?
No, we can't do that happen.
You can't?
Yeah, no, we can't.
Yeah, throughout the hacking or anything.
And giving a court order or a search warrant
to an ISP or a telecom provider is not hacking.
There's a law that says we can do that.
The warrant is what permits us to get things
that are under reasonable expectation of privacy,
which is what you're hacking.
You're hacking because it's not publicly available.
So if you have to breach that expectation of privacy,
we need a warrant as a government to get that.
The warrant will specify what you can and can't do.
And you can break expectation of privacy.
And if this is all to protect against, you know,
all the crazy shit that goes on and abuses and things like that.
So, like, I mean, as much as the government
does kind of a fuck up shit show,
I mean, it is put up in a way to protect people,
protect American people.
Their privacy, their liberty, things like that.
So when people think like,
like my mom does the same thing,
she's like, well, are you reading my e-mail that I love?
I don't have time to read your e-mail.
One.
And two, like, why would I be reading your e-mail?
That doesn't make any sense.
Trust me, I did it.
You don't want to read your mom's e-mail.
You don't want to do that.
Can't go backwards.
You can't.
I'm going to do that.
You can't ever go backwards.
Yeah, so there's...
I get it.
Yeah, there's limitations that we work under, but...
I like that.
It's fine.
It's like, you know, everyone has to have a...
Yeah, we play about the rules.
But when we do win, right,
when we do arrest someone or something like that,
our cases are, you know, airtight, right?
We've covered every angle that we can.
We've got all the information,
and we've vetted everything to make sure that,
we have the right person, right?
We want to make sure we have the right person,
and we have everything that leads up to it.
So, anyway, that's all just background
on how we work and how we work with sources
and stuff like that.
That's good.
I like to do extremely different things.
Karen, it's really like Tim and Jami.
Tim and Jami are very different.
Yeah, because I think that's the other thing, too,
is if we break the rules to get to our end of goal,
how are we getting better than the bad guys?
Right.
Right, and just fighting.
Yeah, it's easy.
I mean, it'd be easy for me to hack into a bunch of stuff,
but then I'm just a hacker.
I'm just a criminal doing rogue stuff.
Oh, vigilante.
True, but vigilante is just not far.
Anyway, that goes a whole different term.
Let's say that for a team of group.
Okay.
So, what else do I have?
Okay, we talked about Irish bank fraud.
OCCP, you're an admin on Hunter.d.gov.
Both.
Both.
Both.
Both.
The use of OCCP.
OCCRP, yeah.
OCCRP is down?
No, it's up.
Okay, yeah.
So, you're an admin on goal?
Yeah.
Well, I have an accent.
Okay.
And...
I know how to understand the documents, too,
which is...
I've learned a lot from the government.
So, if you need to...
If you want to know what a CLO is,
why it's important that it happens in 2008
in Ireland versus the UK,
I can help you understand that.
Okay.
We'll see.
You have...
David Eichrich has...
Well, I guess he tasks you to get into Epstein D-Mail
and his Epstein Y-C-Mail.
You know what he's password-wise?
It's up line.
It's a G-21.
A little...
I hit it.
A little same job.
A little...
Little...
A little same job.
A little same job.
A little same job.
A little same job.
A little same job.
A little same job.
A little same job.
A little same job.
A little same job.
You can just look at the old hacks from...
Oh, right.
Yeah, pretty easy.
But don't tell anybody.
You're also in a single group with Barrett,
Emma, Van, your friend,
and like a hundred other people there.
And a lot of journalists.
Journalists.
Journalists.
Journalists.
Okay.
You're capable of doing some email hacks
and then you'll do some light forensics.
I guess with this single group...
There's a big difference.
Okay.
Not like that.
That's...
I've been practicing a lot with that.
That's like my latest interest.
But mostly...
But with the software.
It happened, you know, not on my own.
I'm not coding it or writing it.
I don't think many people are coding it
or writing it themselves.
No, I'm very good.
I think it's a little bit better than...
But yeah, with Magnet, it was open source.
But with Magnet, of course, it's better.
Yeah, it's not like that.
I can prove that to you.
You need to do a demonstration of that.
Okay.
In a single group, you said Barrett...
Barrett said that he's not getting anything legal.
Is that right?
Or not getting anything stupid?
No.
He's always saying something stupid.
But he's just, you know, he's such a rabble.
Let's see what happens after he calms down a bit.
Because he was high a lot.
Okay.
He was very high.
And he was not happy.
So it was more worried about him.
No one really took it seriously.
You said the rest of the stuff in that group is mainly...
People miscontented about stuff.
Yeah.
You said these steps are basically just bitching a lot.
But like...
A lot of, like, fuck movies meant, you know...
And like, well, actually, I couldn't want to fuck movies meant.
You know, like, well, why would you want to do that?
You know, it's like that stuff.
You know, look at this Twitter post.
Or this cop just beat up this woman on the street.
You know, there's a lot of that, too.
Okay.
With the riots and stuff.
Sure.
But if you're asking if there's, like, organization or people are getting together and, you know...
I think they're very watched.
You know, there's no organization.
It's like, it's just chaos.
It's fun to see what happens.
It's like, Mike, I'm out of it, yeah.
And I meet some interesting people.
There's nothing, nothing explicitly illegal.
They don't talk about, you know, collectivity or hacking stuff or anything like that.
Why?
Well, yeah, of course.
No, there is a talk about that, yeah.
But it's like a friend of mine says,
Oh, do you know how I get ISPs from Prague, you know, circa 2016?
Clearly, you're trying to find a common shit, right?
You know, everyone's a loving the baby.
You know, stuff like that, you know.
And if you have it, you have nowhere to get it.
I think the city's sure to hear you though.
There's a link.
Do you know what Irish bankers are?
The other day, I mean, an Irish banker that knows how to do,
you know, anybody in Ireland right now.
I'm here to get some coin telegraph.
Yeah, stuff like that.
But like, I'm the only idiot that says, Hey, Emma,
can you give me a favor and help me hack David Emmerich?
Because I got to get into his fucking email.
I'm the only idiot that says that.
So, yeah.
Okay.
So no one else crossed about like who's behind pass or who's behind it?
Oh, yeah.
I know.
Yeah.
There's a really good big discussion on who's behind Lowe's.
Oh, Lowe's, I think.
Or, well, no, the abbreviated version of Lowe's.
Okay.
It's like a, whoever did the came out.
Oh, yeah.
Who did they think the came out of?
I think they, I mean, what are some of the opinions of?
All I know is my opinion right now, as I can remember,
and I'm not holding back or meaning information,
because I just can't remember.
But if you give me time to look, I'll find it for you.
My opinion is, I think it's Emma.
The Spanish, the Spanish is broken.
Again, Maria speaks eight languages for sure.
I mean, it's not the first.
It's not a native speaker.
It's not a native speaker.
And the angry, the anger sort of matches Emma's anger.
And the thought process that makes, gets you to write a certain sentence,
matches Harry's thought process.
The way I educated it anyway.
You know, you have to, in order to say the certain sentence,
you have to think and feel the sort of thing.
We're in the, we're in this frame group.
And I see that pattern matched with it.
So what Spanish document was it that matched?
The manifesto.
Oh, the manifesto.
No.
Okay.
Interesting.
So aside from like the speech pattern,
is there anything else, any other reason why you think
the best is behind the game of the island?
Well, the thought process, obviously.
Yeah.
The motivation, I guess, right?
It's really angry.
Well, no, no more.
The motivation, well, you must know.
I mean, if you're angry, you know,
the motivation is just, you can do it.
You know, sometimes, yeah, you're broke, you need some money.
Or if you want to, you know, see, I'm better than you or not.
But it's like, here's a challenge.
You know, that's most of the motivation.
You should know that though, right?
But it's different, too.
Oh, you mean political motivation.
There's different motivations, too,
with different hackers, too, right?
Some hackers are just curious.
Like, they just want to see if they can break the system.
But they're the ones who hack for a purpose, right?
Like, a lot of the hack-tivists out there,
you know, they'll hack because...
We'll leak something.
What about...
We're talking about we'll leak, aren't we?
What about we'll leak?
That's what you're asking about.
Well, there's a bunch of different types of things.
I don't know.
So, the boot leaks appeared on...
Honestly, I don't know why he was going after it.
I don't think he did it.
At first, I think it became the one.
I don't think he did boot leaks.
Boot leaks was...
But you know, and I'm sure you know,
and I'm sure you know that your computer systems are outdated.
Right?
Okay?
You're fucking really outdated, right?
And the FBI's computer systems are outdated.
What do you think the local sheriff's fucking office in Minnesota
is still running, like, Windows NT, right?
So, it's not difficult, you know?
And I think it's consortium.
My personal opinion, based on no evidence at all,
is that consortium hackers just have to talk about the...
the Black Lives Matter, I think, to talk about the police
and here's the revenge.
I don't think it was, you know,
politically motivated by...
motivated by some, like, left-wing George Soros fucking thing.
You know, conspiracy theory, right?
Just angry kids, you know?
That's it.
That's right.
But I could be wrong.
I'm off the wrong side.
So, you don't think you have a vested behind that
that she's behind King Island and what else?
I personally, I think, came here.
Because just her reaction to my asking for the 100,000
in Bitcoin, Deutsche Bank, was sort of took me off.
You don't react like that if you just move.
Interesting.
Yeah, because she doesn't want to share it, though.
Yeah.
There's a prize attached to it, so...
so there was...
so that...
he said there was, like, a lot of discussion about who...
or was it the King and Stink that there was a lot of discussion
in the group of who...
Yeah.
But just for the King and Stink right now, so...
Well, Formation Towns as well.
I've done it before.
But actually, there was no discussion.
That's interesting.
You have a good point.
Yeah, there was no discussion for Formation Towns.
That means that everybody didn't get it.
Oh, yeah.
So that's why it's the way I take out statements.
Yeah.
But since there was a lot of discussion for, like,
payments, that means no one really knew who did it.
Who did Formation Towns?
I don't know.
It wasn't you.
I just joined the...
the thing in the...
well, Marie was stuck in France,
so that was the summer of last year.
That's when that happened.
But I did tell Tim Jeremy, like,
hey, he did it.
You know?
Yeah.
And, oh, God, oh, the whip, yeah.
Okay, so I...
at this point, I'm wondering, you know,
I was working with the FBI, the source.
Well, Emma said to me,
I need you to relay a message to the FBI.
I was like, what?
I said, yes, I want you to give these guys a message.
Okay.
I'm like, tell them about Formation Towns.
I want you to give them a list of people you've...
that are...
and I have it.
I can give you the email.
I'll just forward it to you when I get a chance.
Remind me, text me.
I don't forget.
And I gave it to Tim.
I gave it to Jeremy.
And they were not...
they were like, okay, great.
We don't really care.
Like, give one to a Deutsche Bank.
We don't care about Formation Towns.
And Emma felt like she was not heard by the FBI
because she wanted to help,
but she was not heard.
She was offering help.
She said, look, I'll give you guys the data.
You have a time limit.
That's why it's going to go live in a month.
I'll give you three months to find the information.
I'll forward it to you.
Okay.
I'm just writing a line to someone to text you.
Yeah.
I don't know if we got it.
That's what I'm writing.
Okay.
All right.
Any other signal groups that...
that you're part of that talk about hacking?
Yeah.
Well, they're all...
I mean, all the varied groups.
I call them varied groups, but they're all, like, options.
Oh, no.
The Formation Towns one is still like this.
But, you know, it's like...
Well, I mean, no one's really posted for like,
like seven months.
Still there.
Okay.
And I created a few groups of my own, you know,
up to a Deutsche Bank group.
It's generally like a Luke Harding
and much other journalists.
Oh, and every...
there's every...
once in a while, there's like a fun star chamber
where you get someone and everyone's going to stop at
and we put them in a group, you know, and we just sort of tap.
You know, see what they say.
Yeah.
Well, like Louise Matt, she put her in a group
and he started, you know, what the fuck are you doing?
Why did you say this about Scott's father?
Scott's father is a cop.
Oh.
She doxxed me.
Oh.
What the fuck are you doing?
Why are you going after his father?
You know, he's like, well, he's a Russian spy.
You know, you're just fucking crazy.
Do you understand what you're fucking doing?
That's weird.
Yeah.
I think...
Like, David Adderidge was supposed to be in one
group for COVID, the next guy.
It was a prize.
It was a present for me.
It's like a little beat down room.
Yeah.
That's weird.
Hey, what are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you.
What?
Cool.
Anything else that I missed?
Anything else that you think that...
Yes.
I'm just...
I can't remember all I have.
Yeah, sure.
But it's the eyes of me.
If I remember...
I just...
I will remember it.
I have to be in a mindset.
Sure.
You know, I mean, like...
your memory is...
Yeah.
Yeah, I was going to ask you about something very specific.
You could recall more about them.
Tell me everything you know about everything.
And right now, I'm like a...
I'm not even active anymore.
I'm meeting stuff right now from my memory
because I'm in this room.
And I'm a little bit nervous.
I'm a bit not nervous.
So my brain is adapted to that point.
So as soon as I walk out of the room,
I'm like, oh, we're going to say that.
Yeah, yeah.
You know what I mean?
Okay.
So...
Okay.
Anything else that...
Oh, in turn?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, you saw my number so quick.
Do you think of something that...
you think would be interested in, you know...
surely you can always let me know
and I can find a home for it.
You think?
And do you mean to prosecute?
Do you mean to go after it?
Do you mean to like to read that is...
that needs to be stopped?
Or would you say it's like,
oh, there's some fun just in hacks happening?
What do you mean?
I mean, all those things are...
I work a very narrow spectrum, right?
I work cyber-friendly.
Okay.
But there's...
You're a fraud, though.
Yeah.
But there's also like counter-terrorism
or white collar crimes
or practicing as some children
in national security threats.
Oh, there's a couple lawyers.
Okay.
So I get...
There's people that call...
they claim to be lawyers.
Okay.
And they ask me to do a bunch of stuff.
First they'll have to do very strange data
and then they say they're fighting and doing a lawsuit
against like Iran or something like that
on behalf of the veterans.
They have to go collect data for them.
And it's mostly just...
I don't know why they're asking.
I thought it was some spy.
Oh, like you think they were asking...
when they collect data,
you think it was one of the most...
Yeah.
They're asking you to have it.
And I know these two guys out of DC...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
They...
I told them to go fuck off,
but they did fly out here.
Yeah.
I mean, they had their e-mail accounts.
Yeah, no.
Iran, do you mind if I do that for you?
Sure.
Because they're...
there's something about them that's very off.
They flew all the way out here from DC
and then there was a very weird fucking...
there was a weird experience
what happened after that.
Oh, I thought it was true.
Yeah.
You did this to hack into Iran?
No, no, they wanted...
wire information about money being sent
from anywhere, any bank to Iran
during 2009.
It was just during the Gulf War, please.
Okay.
Well, it actually included Iran in 2010 as well.
Okay.
I'll...
I'll e-mail you and do one.
But, um...
So the plan right now is...
I know a Russian guy.
He works through it, let's say.
That must be...
Yeah.
Or he used to work for us.
Okay.
And he really wants to be an American.
So he can be of very...
very useful guy to you.
What do you think?
Me too.
Me too?
Yeah.
But be careful, because, like, you know,
he's being monitored.
Mm-hmm.
So, uh...
you know, a person died.
I did not want to...
he was a good guy.
He was a good guy.
Or is he good?
Yeah.
He's traveling all over the world.
He doesn't have to go back to Russia.
He keeps being...
getting...
He's accepted.
So he doesn't have to go back.
And he keeps trying to, you know,
ask me all, like,
is there a way or a business?
Can you introduce me to someone?
So, like, Bali...
He's a really good coder.
I don't know.
He's a good kind of guy.
But, yeah.
Uh, that would be very helpful for you,
because he does know a lot.
Well, how do you...
How do you know me?
I'm just gonna...
Uh-huh, traveling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a girlfriend.
A girlfriend is the daughter
of a military general.
That's why.
Very interesting.
Um, I think he was the...
he was a...
he was tired of making military journals.
He came to...
We don't have this position in America,
but it's like a...
a nice speaker at the house.
It's like a...
It's not a attorney general,
but somewhere along the lines of a attorney general.
Um, he's got...
Yeah.
That would be a very interesting theme.
Yeah.
I mean, and like I said,
a lot of these things,
I won't work.
So, like, well,
there's, I'll take the information,
I'll give it to someone else,
and see if they want to pursue it,
and they'll probably talk to yours
and the like that.
Okay.
Okay.
Anyway, that's all good stuff.
Um, I'd like to do...
You can install my number
so you can always, you know,
reach out to me
if you forget something or...
Sure.
You know, think of something later.
Um...
Where does Marla go?
Yeah.
So, as far as Marla goes,
like I said, I think
our primary goal will still be to
make sure you look good
for the investigation.
Right?
Um...
But I can look good.
I don't know what you mean.
Like, just make sure
that the investigator sees
everything that he or she
is supposed to see,
as far as making you
and Marla, you know,
good parents,
and super, uh,
an adult.
But my worry, though,
is that it's already
it's back again
just purposely.
I don't know why.
Again, I just feel like
you did it,
and take the time in it.
Um, so even if we do show
our best stage
and we're the most perfect people
in the world,
you'll see it.
When you read the report,
you'll see what they did.
And now it can be...
I don't know how to fight that,
but it's something I don't know.
It's tough not to crack, too,
because, like I said,
I mean,
what would you suggest
that we do to influence
what's already been written
or how the proceedings
will go on from here?
Well, I had, you know,
my advantage,
uh,
fucking thing dismissed
based on their terrible, uh,
obviously,
no deep process
and misjudgment.
I wrote down a list
for reaction.
Um,
the lies
are caught in camera.
Right.
Versus what they wrote
in the report.
And it'll be good
if you can collect all the evidence
so that you can show that
to the judge or whomever.
Like,
I assume you're going to fire...
You fired your attorney
to hire a new one.
Like,
you know,
because it's probably good
to get an attorney.
Because that was another thing
I wanted to gauge
what you could do
and do we need an attorney
based on what you could do?
I mean,
just my personal thing,
I would probably want an attorney
based on what I was in your situation.
And I just, you know,
this is why people make money
and you can see it in color.
Right.
And like,
yeah,
and if this is completely not
F.D.I.
but just having friends
that have gone through the work
that you want to have a lawyer.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
where you can have a lawyer
and an attorney.
You can retell me that
if you want me to be your lawyer.
I swear to God,
you said that.
I mean,
I love you very much.
Yeah.
It's good that you trust
you that much.
I've been...
Oh, no,
it's not good.
I'm just saying that
a lawyer can represent himself
as a cool friend.
I said,
if you're representing yourself
in America,
you're going to laugh at
the crazy breaking,
okay?
And if the boyfriend
represents the girlfriend,
you can work,
right?
And maybe this will also
help the young
and the vulnerable.
Okay.
And the court is a lot,
a lot,
a lot of emotions,
right?
Always remember
that the judge
cares about nothing
except for the case.
Is it true, though?
Absolutely.
And think about it.
Think about it
from this perspective.
Their whole purpose
for existing
is to ensure
the safety of children.
That's what I want to
believe is true,
but that's not what I've seen.
I've seen only
people acting their
own self-interest.
I haven't seen anything
else like that
in this system.
Well,
when you talk about
the lack of
deep process in it,
something,
maybe some things are falling
apart here,
always come back
to what the judge
is going to ask
and answer those questions
for him.
Does that make sense?
Because one side is going to
say,
oh, this is best for the kids.
And your argument says,
this has to be
best for the kids.
That's what we're talking
about.
We got to make you
look better.
And you've got to make
yourself look better
than there's nothing
left.
Because then the judge
is going to wait until
and say,
this is a better place.
Was in the experience
judged like,
I heard
Dominion is to
know the difference
between the lies
and the fabrications.
To know the difference
between a crazy person
that's just calling
every day to
facility off
versus a person
that's concerned.
And how does the judge
weigh that
in front of them?
To weigh that with
what the judge
needed to lay it out
in front of them?
What's the
best kind of evidence
in front of them?
OK.
So you need
to, like,
get strong
and, again,
you know,
those are the lawyers
who, like,
you need to
try to organize
your response
to those, like,
your buttocks
because they're
representing the facts
to the judge, not.
I mean, you could, too.
No, you're right.
We're going to get there.
Yeah, OK.
But thank you, yeah.
I'm worried because
I looked up this judge
and her reviews were
not good.
And I don't expect her
to have any,
you know,
these are the
things.
But this was
100% bad.
There was nothing good.
I guess the people that
put these are more
motivated to write this.
I know that, too.
Like, I've read
through the lines.
I've been one
through lots of cases,
but I didn't see anybody say
she did great by
not one person.
I only see
she's married to another
judge in that same court.
I see he was
admonished for his
handling of the situation.
She was admonished for this.
They were,
they were
severe.
Like, I'm
I'm
I was focused on
what's successful,
the people that are successful,
right?
How were they successful?
They presented
evidence that
was more favorable
for each child.
Oh.
That's it.
It's very narrow,
and it's really narrow.
But I do that.
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm frustrated.
Because this is what
I do.
Well, that's what
you need to give attorney.
It's clear.
It's clear.
If you walk in the room,
if you guys walk in there,
anybody who's walked
into my life
and read to Steve,
it's night and day.
Obviously,
Marla belongs to this.
It's,
I'm not saying that this is
subjectively.
I mean, I am,
but it's clear.
But to have these
these people do that
and come up with
this,
when you read it,
you'll see.
It's,
that scares me
because that shows
that someone is
something else is going on.
There's something else
I don't know.
I don't know how to gauge it.
I don't know how to weigh it.
I don't know what it is
and scaring it.
It's not
how it should be.
You know,
it's how it should be.
That's the problem.
I held you earlier.
We're honest.
I'll be honest with you now.
It's just scary.
It's just scary things.
That's,
that's Marie's child
but it's also yours.
So,
you've got to focus on those things.
And I'll,
and I'll give you something.
I'm not going to try
but hearing this,
some of what I picked up on
is an allegation of a beard,
of a bruise.
Yeah.
A black eye.
Okay.
Don't be mad about the allegation.
How do you get privy?
I know,
but you can,
but that's why they picked the shit
that's hard to disprove.
How do I go and disprove your phone?
We have photos from the game.
Well,
you said you also had a video crew
that was following you.
We have a video crew
and we have photos of Marlon
from that day.
Okay.
So,
so then someone says,
oh, well,
you need to produce those
to show that that allegation is false.
You just have to focus on that.
Does that make sense?
That's,
yeah,
I mean,
like it's easy.
And you need to.
It sounds easy.
I can do that
but they can only say
something else.
How do you disprove Marlon
going through the trash?
Scouraging for food?
How do I disprove that?
At 1 a.m.,
she says,
he's going through the trash
alone,
trying to get food out of
garbage dumpsters.
Marlon,
an eight-year-old.
How do I disprove that?
And that's,
that's the thing.
You can't disprove it.
You can't prove a negative, right?
You can't disprove.
Go disprove it.
You're not,
tell me,
prove me you're not guilty.
A little garlet letter?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's,
that's,
that's,
that's what I'm trying to say.
I'm trying to go to the
top of these lawyers.
Like,
they've seen it all.
They've seen,
you know,
they've probably seen
elements of your story before
and they know what,
they hopefully they will know
what a good response to those
things are.
And another thing,
it's not just being a good,
like,
you can be a vicious,
hard-going lawyer,
but if you don't understand
and you don't understand
the process,
how are you going to be
at the other side,
whether you want or not?
Yes.
You have to understand
Yes.
You have to understand your situation.
We don't.
We don't.
He didn't tell us anything.
He didn't want that job to be done.
He was using us for his own case.
Can you see that's pretty tricky?
I can't tell you what to do with your attorney to fire that and get a new one or what kind
of attorney.
I just can't do that because I think I'm starting to be in a certain spot as any human would
just do any process.
You have to understand the other side of it.
I did.
I'm telling you, we accidentally put ourselves in the middle of another case.
We're being used for someone else's case.
The lawyer we found, the woman that we recall, wants us to help her with her bigger case.
That's what we're used for.
So our lawyer was not working our best interest.
He's working for his best interest and her best interest.
That's the problem.
And that's why I'm fucking, that woman, the judge, knows that because he's been working
in that group for 30, 20 years.
Everyone knows each other.
It's so ancestral down there.
She knows that, but she's still accepted that what she did.
And that scares me too.
He's judged.
The whole thing used to be, you have to get paternal affairs down there and fucking clean this place up because something's wrong here.
And these are children.
It's fucked up.
You know, they think they're above the law now.
These people are down there.
It's fucked up.
The egos are so big.
Nope.
Like, I've seen big egos, like bankers, like billionaires.
They don't say anything against these lawyers and the judges.
It's crazy.
But we don't have your back.
We're going to have your case.
That's what I'm telling you.
For example, he said, clear as day in writing, I am counsel for Bob Brooksman.
Marie calls him last night.
We record the conversation.
He doesn't know.
Why didn't you say to Tim and Lucy that you were Vowell's counsel?
I'll fucking Vowell.
Don't listen to him.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Vowell's an idiot.
Vowell's a bully.
He's going to ruin you.
He's going to screw up your case.
You need to drop Vowell.
No, but you didn't answer my question.
How is it that you said this?
I mean, it's right here in the email.
I'm looking at it.
I did not say that, Marie.
I said, I'm your counsel.
I'm Marie's counsel.
And I'm here to help.
That's it.
You want to talk about this?
You want to talk about going with Vowell?
I can walk away anytime.
I don't need this case for 30 minutes of this.
All right.
He was denying reality.
Okay.
That's scary.
That's your attorney.
That was our attorney.
That's my attorney.
That's your attorney.
Yeah, but that's also the relationship with the judge.
That's what I'm saying.
It's like that, don't it?
It seems like we're correcting it from wrong.
Your frustration is that you believe that there's corruption at the judicial level.
Like the judge is corrupt.
Yeah.
That's the problem.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
No experience with this at all.
I'm just telling you, my experience with this is where I talk.
Well, it's because nothing we can tell you about the process is going to make any sense
if you don't trust the system, right?
Because right now you don't trust the system because you think the judge is corrupt, right?
So, then the question is, what is our solution?
We can't just correct the problem, right?
That's right.
We have to find a solution to it.
And I cannot be, I can't be an asshole and just do it for myself.
And that's why I say, well, there's other people's children.
So, if I read about our mind about their kids being taken away from them, we can't...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Right?
So, like, we can talk all day with you about how to help you.
But if you don't trust the judge, nothing that we can say is going to make any difference, right?
So, as far as being a corrupt judge, like if you wanted us to investigate the judge for
public corruption or something like that, that's a whole other case, a whole other issue that
we would have to resolve that would take years.
It's not going to help you.
So, how do you navigate it?
Right, right.
So, the best advice I can give you is that, as unfair as it sounds right now, there seems
like there's a lot of things that are going on with the judge.
What we've talked about is true.
The judges do have a kid that interests that hand.
Like, you can form a whole conspiracy about why this judge wants to take M-[Redacted] away from
you.
And it's about M-[Redacted].
And that's what we have to focus on, right?
Because if the judge is trying to, you know, screw someone over...
You're going back to the same...
Okay, so, what's our solution going to be for a corrupt judge that is just out to fuck
everyone?
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm not saying...
Do you know how it comes off?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like that.
I mean, in this specific case, we accidentally found a lawyer that has an agenda to get another
guy, right?
We fell into this trap, into a circle of friends, they're like a cabal, they're very close to
each other, they're married to each other for fuck's sake.
You know each other very well for 20 plus years.
They feel like they're above the law, they have their own law structure there.
They decide what happens, not the law.
And we saw accidentally the triple lambing out into this little cabal and we became a
tool all of a sudden.
Now, when we drop this guy, he's not going to be happy about that.
He knows the judge very well.
Very fucking well, they're very close.
You can see it in the...
You know, they say don't record...
You know how they record this shit?
The trials?
They fucking record everything.
You know, and so we went through it last night and heard again how he did not defend us.
I mean, I don't want to get too much into it.
We actively tried to get him out of the room knowing that Murray was lying in the belt
under the room, don't worry about it.
You know Murray, you really have to get him out of the room.
And that's our lawyer throwing us under the bus.
And the judge knew it.
I don't know how to describe it.
You think if you had a new lawyer it would change the situation?
No.
But that's a solution, I think, on the table right now.
I don't know.
There might be a good guy, like a stand-up guy.
And he's told us it's a whole other system down there.
You need to get a lawyer that's court ordered that knows that system.
You know, that's your best bet.
I can get you an expensive lawyer that can do it for you, too.
But he's not going to be as good as the people that are in that court.
And that means that it is corrupt.
They do it amongst each other.
They have their own star chambers, certain things.
And so it's Sava who's creating fucking evidence, and she's a social worker.
She's supposed to have the child's best interests at heart.
That is her.
When she was hired she could pay $100,000 a year to do that.
And the other guy, 200,000,000.
They're supposed to be good at their job.
Comes in and starts fucking lying.
And changing the narrative, read it.
See how the narrative changed after page 15?
The narrative changed dramatically.
You'll see.
How do you fight that?
That's fucked up.
That's what's fucked up.
What I was my plan was if I am all I have options,
I'm going to throw it onto the group, more than three
of them, and say, look, this is a problem.
I need your help.
What can you do?
And that's done with my last, but then you got something.
It's good.
I want to get that was my other choice.
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
And it's from M-[Redacted], I got to go do it.
No, totally.
I mean, in a year, you said to walk away from here,
but look at other references for lawyers.
Because you always think about a dad or a friend.
They had their own reasons for introducing you
to that lawyer.
So if you're bowling under and hearing me, it's systemic.
Like, I'm not having a great, great burden in the world.
It wins everything.
But not in this world, because this world is
run by these people.
They make their own goals.
The law that was first followed, they create their own laws.
That's a problem.
Let's read the reader for us.
I think it's going back to thinking about why we're better
off going in with a lawyer than by yourself.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I agree.
Absolutely.
No, absolutely.
Yeah.
I'm going with the lawyer.
We're fine with the lawyer.
The thing that we're trying to say,
like, here's the thing, you have to either trust
that what we're saying is from experience,
or you don't have to take our opinion.
I mean, it's just a opinion of three.
I'm just so media all the data, I just want
to make sure you have everything.
So the thing would be, if your attorney also
sees that there's this corrupt system where the judge is
in bed with everyone else, they may
be able to change a venue.
They need to do something.
But they would have that knowledge, right?
Like, I don't have it now.
They're not a, I don't do child custody battles,
but they need to be based on doubt defense, certainly.
A couple of different occasions.
But those are different situations, different judges
to people.
So whatever training you get, we'll
be able to look after your best interests.
The point would be, though, is you have to trust
that that attorney is going to be good,
and is going to be looking after your best interests.
So do your research, and we know we
can help with that, if that would be the best option.
But I'm trying to find a good solution for you,
because I don't want you to walk away from here thinking,
like, well, if I don't care, I do want to help you.
But we need to think of realistic ways we can help you.
And that would be the best way to do it.
Sorry, maybe you're right.
I'm just thinking.
So realistic way would be to play their game,
find out what their rules are, and play their game.
So that's the end of it.
I mean, I don't want you to be upset.
I mean, it's not emotional, and I understand.
I've always started throwing out there,
seeing that we're interested in doing this whole,
let's take down the system and create a new system in its place.
But I don't think you're there yet.
But I do want to do that at some point.
But right now, I have to get Marla focused.
I'm just going to say, right now, it's play their game.
That's fine.
It's perfectly fine.
But yeah, OK, no worries.
And I think some of those things are going to be in your dress.
You all right?
Yeah, I think there's a lot of a year of that whole process.
When we talk here, and I think what I want to make sure you
understand is that we'll focus on the game special,
because that's your immediate need, right?
And then there's the overall need.
What can we solve quickly?
What needs to be addressed quickly?
And then the bigger thing, the bigger aspect of it.
It's not that we're not interested in that, because we are.
Yeah, one thing at a time.
Well, you're here right here.
What's your number one goal?
Marla, right?
So when you ask a question, it's not
that we're side stepping the issues, whatever it is.
We're focused on, because we're addressing.
Oh, no, absolutely.
You're sorry.
Yes, I hope that you didn't think
No, I don't think it's such a, I just, I do this all the time,
because I mean with this book, I just think you guys,
you don't know all the data, and if you just knew all the data,
you'd see how I see it.
That's what I'm thinking.
It doesn't mean it's true.
But it's important to me.
And yeah, as what you do, and what I've committed myself to do,
is I want you to understand what we're coming from.
I don't want you to walk away like,
I don't want to give a shit about the bigger problems.
No, you do.
But right now, you're in front of us.
How do we help you out?
Okay, thank you.
And thank you again.
And again, that's our opinion.
So it's not legal, it's just my opinion.
Cool.
And yeah, sorry, I know what you're doing.
I wasn't, yeah, can we just throw that out there?
No, no, no, I just want to, sometimes,
I think it's always better,
and maybe this is a fault of mine,
is to be more articulate and clear,
and to clarify stuff, so that when we walk away,
we're clear about what the perception was,
or what the intent was, but not intent to accept.
I know your intent, yeah, no, I trust your intent,
absolutely, I do trust your intent, obviously.
That, yeah, and I hope you trust mine.
You can do something you can work on,
if you need me, like I told you before,
you know, if you can't do anything,
and I've been through that before with Tim and Jan,
and when they get stuck on some sort of bureaucratic thing,
I'm still happy about it, so, appreciate that.
Good deal, I think we got a good, good work and plan.
Maybe, I mean, I'll even try to do some research
on a lawyer for you, and give you some suggestions,
or something like that, I don't know,
we'll see what I can do.
I don't know, just do the same research you can do,
but at least I can give you a,
okay, well, this looks good, that doesn't look good,
but anyway, we'll go for that part first,
and then if you find anything else,
then you can tell us who would be good.
I'll, can you do more specific with help with?
Yeah, I mean, do you know what I'm doing now?
Yeah, yeah.
So, like, today was just to assess
what kind of access you have, or what kind of skills you have.
So what I'll do is I'll write this up and ask around,
like maybe there's someone who might call a crime
who has, you know, a need for something
that you can help with, and then I'll find them and say,
hey, this is what he's got,
this is the skills he has, this is the access he has.
That's all based on what we've said today.
That's why if there's anything else
that you have access to, or crimes that you're aware of,
all those things are useful,
because then we can use that to say,
okay, this person can use you to this person.
Oh, okay.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, it makes sense.
Right now, we're just the gatekeepers
of your information, like, you give us the information,
we send it out to other bureau people,
because we can't have 800 people in the room right now.
Right, right, so it's a placement.
That's right, okay.
Okay, yeah.
That's the whole reason we're here,
is just to see what you can provide us
so that we can help you, make sense.
Okay, I will be putting a list of journalism.
Right.
Any questions you can always give?
Don't get to anybody.
And I can, I'm not, I can't get anything,
but I can get a pretty good amount of data.
And it would be a more specific ask, too.
We would say, okay, hey, do you know
next person at the Miami Herald or something like that?
What do you know about them?
And that would be someone else,
but wouldn't it be me?
Probably someone out of Miami, right?
So, anyway, we're gonna take all this stuff
and digest it, hopefully we can help you out at the same time.
But if you have any questions,
you can always give me a call or, you know,
so these guys are in LA, and I'm obviously in Houston,
but you know, either way, we can help you out, okay?
Okay, are you not gonna be an LA person?
No.
You're gonna be a Houston person.
I'm a Houston person, okay.
Yeah, so if anything develops,
you'll probably be having an idea.
Yeah, you're okay.
Okay, so you just came out here to discuss me.
Cool, man, thank you.
Glad to, thank you, kind of.
You can come all the way down there, right?
Yeah.
Oh, cool, I hope.
And I can't fill in there, right?
Yeah, please don't, yeah.
Not even that you had a being, or that you...
You live in Auburn, you know?
Is she okay?
Yeah, I don't know.
Auburn, obviously, knows you being there.
So, I don't know if I've seen her, but...
I wouldn't tell her anything,
but if I were to talk about it,
or if she's told us...
You're not even going to talk about it.
You're not even going to talk about it, I mean...
I think anyone who's seen me,
personally, better, I'd be talking to her in 21.
That'd be great.
You'd be talking to her in 23.
Not funny.
Yeah, I would never hear you talking to her.
You'd be talking to her all the time.
I'd play to her.
No, she'd play to her.
She would.
Is she around today?
Yeah.
I can play by...
I don't know, I could still talk to her a lot.
You could play by.
Talk to her real quick, she'd talk to her.
You want to come by the class?
Yeah, I know, yeah.
We've got an hour.
Well, let's see.
Let me call her.
She should be getting out of work.
She'd be done by Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
Yeah, she'd send me a text to whatever.
I'd love to hear from her.
Sure.
She'd be on the run.
She was kind of, you know, having to...
She'd be on the run.
She'd be down to the head.
She'd be on the run.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
