4000	6000	No, this is David.
6000	8000	Uh, hello? Oh, let me just turn this off. Hello?
8000	10000	Uh, David, uh, David Ho?
10000	12000	Uh, David Ho, yeah.
12000	14000	Oh, Co, the K, sorry.
14000	16000	Hold on, let me just turn this thing off.
16000	18000	Okay. Hi, how's it going?
18000	22000	Uh, you're Tim's, uh, you're the FBI LA, right?
22000	24000	Right, right.
24000	28000	Okay, cool. Great. Um, so did Tim tell you what was going on?
28000	32000	He just said that, uh, he has some issues.
32000	36000	And, um, we're like, we've done some stuff with other people.
36000	39000	Um, and it sounds like some of the same issues
39000	42000	with, um, child care and things like that.
42000	44000	Yeah. Um, so anyway, I'm going to get a little bit more
44000	46000	information from you and see what we can do to help.
46000	48000	Sure. Sure, absolutely.
48000	52000	Uh, so David, are you, um, are you like an attorney
52000	55000	or with the FBI? What's your, what's your role?
55000	57000	No, I'm an agent just like Tim is.
57000	59000	Oh, a special agent. Okay. Cool.
59000	62000	Are you guys in the same, are you like, is there any difference
62000	66000	or did I, you could tell me DC three?
66000	68000	Uh, I'm sorry, say that one more time.
68000	70000	Are you in DC three?
70000	74000	So he's, he's out in New York and I'm, well, I'm actually
74000	78000	based out of another office, but, uh, I'm working with the FBI LA.
78000	83000	So, um, I'll actually be in LA, um, actually on Tuesday,
83000	89000	Tuesday night and then, um, are you the agent from Houston?
89000	91000	Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
91000	92000	So what happened then?
92000	95000	So Tim told me he got a call from you.
95000	97000	I didn't know that you were the agent Houston till just now.
97000	101000	And then you were interviewing him with a third party on the
101000	104000	line and what woman named Sabah Hapta.
104000	106000	I don't know anything about that.
106000	108000	Oh, wow. Okay.
108000	110000	He's talking about something else.
110000	113000	He didn't tell me anything about who's Shabah Hapta.
113000	115000	Should I know what Shabah Hapta is?
115000	118000	Uh, yeah, yeah. She's the evil DCS DCFS woman.
118000	120000	Oh, okay.
120000	126000	So I, I don't know who, so I know, I know there was some DCFS person.
126000	127000	I didn't realize that.
127000	128000	Okay.
128000	131000	So Shabah Hapta is the DCFS agent.
131000	132000	Yeah.
132000	133000	Sabah.
133000	137000	It's a, it's S-A-B-A-H-A.
137000	142000	It's like hate, but with a B, H-A-B-T-E.
142000	146000	Okay. S-A-B-A-H-A-B-T-E.
146000	147000	That's correct. Yeah.
147000	153000	She's with DCFS and she, um, well, look, I'll give you the quick version.
153000	159000	Um, my girlfriend Marie, which, um, uh, jam, you know, jammy, jammy tam?
159000	162000	I can't, can't say I do. Who's jammy tam?
162000	165000	Uh, he's also agent out in New York, SDNY.
165000	166000	Oh, that's right.
166000	167000	Yeah.
167000	170000	So I, I've heard of the name. I actually have never talked to jammy.
170000	172000	I talked with Tim just once.
172000	174000	Oh, okay. Well, they're both, they're all good people.
174000	177000	And Carmen, you probably, you probably don't know Carmen either.
177000	182000	But, you know, I've been working with them on, they told you what I've been doing, right?
182000	184000	Right. Some stuff in Deutsche Bank?
184000	185000	Yes. There you go.
185000	186000	Deutsche Bank.
186000	187000	Uh-huh.
187000	189000	Just, you know, catching the bad guys basically.
189000	195000	Um, so, and they did a favor for me a while ago where, uh, Marie and her son, uh, Marlowe
195000	198000	are 18 years old. Um, they need to get there.
198000	201000	Well, see, Marie's going through this very contentious divorce.
201000	205000	Um, the ex-husband's not a good guy kind of divorce, you know.
205000	209000	And, uh, and, uh, so she needed to divorce him.
209000	212000	And she, the only way she could was to get off his visa.
212000	215000	Um, and he tried everything he could to not allow that to happen.
215000	218000	But fortunately jammy and Tim and Carmen made it happen.
218000	220000	So she, she got off his visa.
220000	223000	She has her own visa with Marlowe on it.
223000	230000	Um, but, uh, now that divorce proceedings has started, have started, he has escalated
230000	232000	dramatically, dramatically so.
232000	241000	Um, including his escalation, now the short version is he's launched a full on attack
241000	243000	on myself as the boyfriend.
243000	247000	And Marie obviously is the, uh, is the ex-wife.
248000	254000	The kind of guy that would rather see the world burn than lose Marie's attention.
254000	255000	Does that make sense?
255000	256000	You know the types?
256000	257000	Sure.
257000	258000	Okay.
258000	259000	Unfortunately, I know a couple, but.
259000	260000	Yeah.
260000	261000	Yeah, I do.
261000	262000	I do.
262000	266000	It's unfortunate, especially when, uh, especially here in this case, because there's an eight
266000	270000	year old, like he, the sort of person doesn't, uh, put the child first.
270000	271000	His needs first.
271000	273000	And then the child, right? Marlowe.
273000	276000	So I keep saying the child, like he's like, I'm just saying, but it's Marlowe.
276000	277000	He's an eight year old.
277000	278000	So it puts.
278000	280000	I mean, he's Marie's child.
280000	281000	Yeah.
281000	283000	No matter how old he is, he's always going to be Marie's child.
283000	284000	I get you.
284000	285000	Exactly.
285000	288000	I don't know, but I, I come from, and my, my language has gotten colder as I've talked
288000	289000	with lawyers.
289000	290000	Cause now I say the child.
290000	292000	It's, you know, it's very terrible.
292000	293000	But, um, anyway.
293000	300000	So, uh, Marlowe, uh, in, uh, you had, you see his, his, he has a problem.
300000	305000	Um, not only has he gone, the reason he's gone mad is 11 years ago.
305000	311000	He had a spinal aneurysm, which left him paralyzed for about a year.
311000	314000	And Marie was married to him at the time and nursed him back to health.
314000	319000	He was able to walk again, but he did not regain all his functions.
319000	322000	So, uh, his bladder, his stomach, all this stuff.
322000	324000	He has to use a catheter, et cetera, et cetera.
324000	331000	Um, and of course the impotent, and that's one of the poor guys, you know, for 10 years
331000	334000	can't have sex or have a hard on.
334000	337000	So, uh, oh, Marie's here by the Marie.
337000	338000	This is cat.
338000	339000	Mr. Ho.
339000	340000	Co.
340000	341000	David Co.
341000	342000	Okay.
342000	343000	Hello.
343000	345000	Thank you for calling on a Sunday night.
345000	346000	Yeah.
346000	347000	It's okay.
347000	348000	It's okay.
348000	349000	She listens.
349000	350000	Sure.
350000	351000	Sure.
351000	352000	No.
352000	353000	Okay.
353000	354000	Thank you.
354000	355000	Thanks.
355000	356000	Uh, so, um, 16 years.
356000	357000	Sorry.
357000	358000	16 years, he says.
358000	362000	And, uh, so when she, uh, they've been separated for a while because he would not allow a divorce.
362000	366000	Um, but his brain and like his body has deteriorated, but so is the brain.
366000	372000	I mean, if you can imagine 16 years without any, I guess, sexual release or, uh, friendship.
372000	376000	He hasn't had a girlfriend also in 16 years.
376000	379000	So you can, this is the type of person I'm telling you about.
379000	381000	So you know this type, right?
381000	382000	Not even a girlfriend.
382000	385000	So the obsession with Marie is very, very severe.
385000	392000	And, um, uh, so Marlo and Marie's and I both noticed that is the deterioration has escalated
392000	393000	dramatically.
393000	399000	So, so Marie took it upon herself to not, they've had a, not a shared custody agreement, but
399000	404000	since they're marrying, they've had a, um, verbal agreement where Marie pretty much has
404000	409000	Marlo, I'd say 75 to 80% of the time and Steve sees him on the weekends.
409000	414000	But at this point, Marie decided that she could not trust him alone with Marlo.
414000	416000	So she kept him when COVID started.
416000	417000	She said, I'm going to keep him.
417000	421000	I mean, I've got him for school and we can sit here and we can talk to him.
421000	423000	And cause he changed a little bit around February.
423000	425000	We still don't know why Marlo has.
425000	426000	We don't know what's happened.
426000	431000	So Marie kept him and that escalated things even further for the divorce proceedings.
431000	432000	Right.
432000	439000	So fast forward till very recent, about a month ago, uh, we have, we're not very well liked
439000	442000	in our, um, building area.
442000	444000	We live in the brewery artist lofts.
444000	446000	It's, you know, the brewery is.
446000	447000	Yeah.
447000	452000	I've heard of it, uh, kind of a nice, uh, kind of artsy place.
452000	453000	Yeah.
453000	454000	Exactly.
454000	455000	Yeah.
455000	456000	Yeah.
456000	457000	Yeah.
457000	458000	It's, it's a lot.
458000	459000	I know, I know.
459000	460000	Don't worry.
460000	461000	I'm going to explain.
461000	464000	I say we're not well liked here because the building management has been fighting us for
464000	467000	some time because of, of another crazy incident.
467000	469000	Um, but we have to talk.
469000	474000	You see, I don't want to bore David with all the details of that, but it's just a whole
474000	475000	another thing.
475000	487000	So there's a woman here named Patille, uh, S-A-A-J-T-I-A-N and she lives two doors down.
487000	493000	Now she recently moved into that, this flat and we didn't, we never heard of her.
493000	495000	Sorry, but, uh, we thought she was harmless at first.
495000	497000	It's like typical normal art.
497000	499000	Well, she's like a really bad artist.
499000	501000	She makes crystal jewelry just to get to the point.
501000	503000	Like no one wants to buy a crystal jewelry.
503000	506000	Um, but Marlowe, he's eight years old and he's very inquisitive.
506000	507000	He's very talkative.
507000	510000	And he was like, Oh my God, crystal jewelry.
510000	515000	And she, she met him in the park and she talked to him and, um, convinced him to become her
515000	517000	apprentice for crystal jewelry.
517000	519000	And remember this is COVID.
519000	521000	So everyone's living with each other for the last four months.
521000	523000	So everyone's going crazy.
523000	525000	You know, it's, uh, what's the word?
525000	529000	Uh, you know, Jack Nicholson, the shining sort of worldwide.
529000	530000	Yeah.
530000	531000	Cabin fever.
531000	532000	Cabin fever.
532000	533000	Yeah.
533000	536000	Cabin fever in the whole country and probably the world because everyone's living together.
536000	538000	So, uh, we figured, wow.
538000	539000	Okay.
539000	543000	She's, she wants Marlowe to come to her place to do, to make crystal jewelry for two hours
543000	544000	of the day.
544000	546000	And we're like, Oh, that's great idea for us.
546000	547000	We can finally be alone for two hours.
547000	548000	You know.
548000	552000	So, and we, so Serrat, we think she's fairly sane.
552000	558000	And, uh, Marie goes to introduce herself and we talk about a housekeeper.
