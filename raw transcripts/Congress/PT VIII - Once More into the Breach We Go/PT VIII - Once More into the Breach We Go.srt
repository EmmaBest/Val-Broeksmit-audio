1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
Okay, okay. He calls you and asks what you've got in Trump. You say you really

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,920
don't know. Right. He agrees to pay ten grand, half upfront, half on delivery for

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,840
everything. Pretty quick conversation. Glenn doesn't want to be on an unsecured

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,000
phone line. No, he's very paranoid. Yeah, and wants to switch to signal. Yeah. And so

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've seen those signal messages. He says let's get you here ASAP, please come.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,360
There's some discussion about where your grenades should go. You settle on

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,120
St. Thomas. 5,000 bucks arrives in your PayPal account. He gives you an amix

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,600
number to book plane tickets. You go to St. Thomas. The 5,000 arrives in St. Thomas.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,360
So first he just gives me the car car number. Well, he offers. No, I don't think

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
that's right. Yeah, yeah, he offers to send. We'll check that. Okay. There's because

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,560
I've looked at these times and you've showed me the PayPal receipt or the

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,880
anyway, we'll come back to that. But that's some pretty sure that was in St. Thomas

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,080
after he and his tech guy looked over the files. Then he said, okay, then they

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,800
sent the 5,000. And it doesn't matter. There's you got the 5,000. Before you

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,920
get to St. Thomas, Glenn asked for some research on specific topics. He says any

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:24,880
Russian stuff at all. He is looking for stuff on Rentec and Mercer. And then he

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
said you say you appreciate you've got that stuff. And but it's gonna take a

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,680
lot of digging to find it. He says be safe and I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, you're

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,040
feeling pretty proud and excited. This is like higher level clandestine work than

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,480
you've been previously doing. Glenn is a celebrity a little bit. Yeah. Okay, I

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:53,280
call Peggy too. Okay. So it's a good Peggy come back in the story here. Okay. And

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,160
if you want to make a note for Peggy's, but chronologically, yes. Okay, St. Thomas.

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:07,920
Glenn comes with a computer dude. Yeah. You alternate between going through all

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,240
the stuff in the hotel suite. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. You all were in a suite

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,760
together, right? No. I had my own and they had one in a different building down

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,120
the hall. But in the same hotel? In the same hotel. Okay. And whose hotel suite were you

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,680
working in? Mine. Okay. And it so you alternate between that and you spend a

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
bunch of time out at a picnic table on the beach, drinking beers, smoking cigarettes.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:40,160
Yeah, and it took me to Strip Club. Okay. Yeah, dirty weird Strip Club. Okay, you've

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,800
described Glenn as manic. Unable to sit still, chattering constantly about Trump

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,400
and about fusions, financial struggles. He said he told you. He told me everything

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,480
wasn't just that. Well, but you got into. Slightly manic. I wouldn't say over it

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,440
because manic is a strong word too. Okay, I'll say slightly manic. Yeah. Slightly.

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:11,240
Paranoid. Quite paranoid. Okay. So he told you that any kind of dirt you could turn

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,560
up on Mercer, or Rentec, or Trump, or Deutsche could be valuable to him, to his

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,560
current or prospective future clients. Yeah. Okay. And he at one point. He sold me

37
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,440
because he knew I did not like Trump. He saw my tweets. And so he knew I was

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,320
anti Trump. So he said it's it would be helpful for him to learn about how the

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,080
funding Mercer funded the Trump campaign and any connection the Deutsche Bank had

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,120
the Trump and the connection between Mercer and Deutsche Bank. And Rentec was

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
its own entity. If anything on Rentec, fine, but it was mostly Mercer was a

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:54,240
focus. Mostly Mercer. Yeah, Rentec is secondary. Well, Mercer is Rentec. I know.

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,040
Well, not really. Mercer had, on his own, whatever his foundation is, gave that

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,400
money to Trump. Rentec did not give the money to Trump. Yeah. So in that sense.

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,640
Okay, so you're going through all this stuff. You don't actually find a whole

46
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,440
lot in Bill T. Millall concerts. No, as you knew already, there are no mentions of

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,320
Trump. No. There is a lot of Rentec stuff. Yeah, there's a lot. Well, that's a

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,840
competitive. The name Mercer hardly comes up at all. There's lots of

49
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,000
Rentec stuff. But most of that, it doesn't really shed new light beyond. He's a

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
Senate Bob Roach and his crew have already turned up so much. So you spend a

51
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,800
few days there and then Glenn invites you to come back to Washington with him.

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Yeah. And you agree? Yeah. And you fly separately to avoid a

53
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,880
razmine suspicion. At Dulles, you get a text. I don't know if that's true, but it

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,280
could be. What? Fly separately to not a razmine suspicion. The only reason I

55
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,200
have that in here is because you told me. Really? So if you don't, if you're not

56
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,560
sure about that, I shouldn't have. I'm not sure, but sounds good. That's fine. No, no, no,

57
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,720
that's, they, because Glenn said he had to go back for something first. So he only

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,520
stayed a few days and then went back to hold still, hold tight here while we

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,880
figure out what to do next. Okay. You get to Dulles, he sends you a text with an

60
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,960
address for you to come to. But keep in mind, there's a lot going on in this

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,920
hotel. There's this convention. Yeah. But it's not really that interesting on the

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,960
grand scheme of things because it's just like a, it's a National Guard meeting. I

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,800
think there was National Security Services. No, it's National Guard. I've looked at

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,320
your picture of the. There was a lot. There was, well, it was one ballroom. There

65
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,800
was every single ballroom had different government agency attached to it. There's

66
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,400
all government people. Certainly all the different government agencies listed on

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,800
that thing. On that specific one. But there was, again, that's a huge

68
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,840
hotel with a lot of these rooms.

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,920
Just to be sure you can find some research, find out what was going on in

70
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,440
that hotel. I'm sure there's evidence online.

71
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,040
Okay. So you get to Glenn's house, brings you to a guest room. Next morning, you

72
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,120
get this great up close view of his paranoia. You're on the front porch

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,720
smoking a Marlboro. He comes out notices a small rip in one of the window

74
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,000
screens and says, why are you messing with my window? Did you sneak out last

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,200
night? Right. You say no. Well, no, it was more like, you know, what did you, did

76
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,600
you meet somebody last night? Did you come out of the house? Because sneaking

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,640
out is like, you know, I'm just kidding. But it's more like, did you, did you

78
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,000
have a rendezvous with someone? There was a car I saw coming around the car in

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,160
the house. I heard some noises. I heard the car speed off. I heard the door

80
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,280
closed and open. Did you meet somebody? Did you in the middle of the night? No,

81
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,640
of course not. Okay. And he said, he kind of eyes you suspiciously and says,

82
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,440
let's see what the video shows. Yeah, he points to the camera, which I knew was

83
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,920
there. And there was a terror in the, in the screen, in front of the screen. Okay.

84
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,160
So he brings you into his office and there shows you the, the video feed. I

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,280
wrote you this whole story. Yeah, no, I'm just, I'm just making sure we got this

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,400
right. So he in the video shows his son trying to pry the screen off the window

87
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,080
to get it drunk in late. Um, and so he kind of Glenn kind of relaxes a little

88
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,440
bit at that point. He doesn't view you for Glenn. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you never

89
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,000
apologize. Yeah, I've got that. So a couple of nights, you spend a couple nights

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,120
there. Yeah. Then you go up to his secluded house in the countryside down

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,920
a long dirt lane with a force in one side and a river on the other. Yeah. A few

92
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,760
boats moored at the Flood and Dock. Yeah. You spend a long time repairing wooden

93
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,400
fence. Yeah. Trumpets through the mud. Yeah. Writing ATVs in the wood. Yeah.

94
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,320
Drinking a lot. Yeah. Beer and liquor. Beer and liquor. He has a case of beer and he had a bunch of booze and

95
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,600
that kind of thing. Yeah. You talked about Trump. Yeah. You talked about Christopher

96
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,280
Steele. Yeah. You talked about your father's. Yeah. Okay. You told Glenn about

97
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:20,920
your story and he told you about his story. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. Glenn's

98
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:33,360
hired a retired Deutsche Auditor. Okay. And here I go into stuff about that spreadsheet,

99
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:50,680
which is how we started all these videos. Right. Okay. So there's, this is when Glenn,

100
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:58,680
so you go back to Washington and Glenn starts sending you out to meet people. So first up is

101
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:09,920
Bob Roach. Right. And let's see. Glenn tells Roach, I'd really like you to look at this.

102
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,400
And Roach is happy to do so. It seems like an interesting opportunity. So one afternoon,

103
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,600
you show up at the Dirksen building. You, by the way, this might have been Stan,

104
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,640
the Beacon Hotel. Yeah. Okay. Charging room service. No room service. No room service.

105
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,240
Yeah. Glenn made it clear. Don't use room service on my card. So I said, okay, I will not use room

106
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:39,600
service on your card. Okay. Um, I never did. Sure about that. Is that the only reason I have that

107
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,400
in here is because I told you specifically, Glenn said to me, do not use room service on this card.

108
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,640
You can, this is for the room only. You pay for the food and stuff and just don't use the room

109
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,400
service because I don't want to get out of hand. I said, okay. I never use room service on that

110
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,160
card. Um, so how are we paying for food and stuff while you're there? Oh, he gave me five

111
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,720
grand. Okay. And then the other money came in too. With what other money? The BG money. Okay.

112
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:17,240
Okay. So you go to Roach's office and he's got this bundle of printouts for you with a bunch of

113
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:25,320
news articles and other stuff. And he tells you that he's looking for a Trump connection to Russia

114
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,840
by way of Deutsche Bank. Bob Roach? Yes. And he says he's also very interested in anything I have

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:44,520
especially in the stress test stuff as well. And he said he was putting together a, I don't know if

116
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,840
it was a book because he had a bunch of books he'd written or showed me. I know, so those are

117
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,160
sending oversight hearings he had done. It's like 16-0. He was together some kind of project where

118
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,360
he was looking at all the times regulators were asking Deutsche Bank to do something and they

119
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,400
either never responded or bullshit responded or responded to do something and never followed up

120
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,680
on it. So if I had any instances of that, it would be very helpful for him personally. Okay.

121
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:20,240
Then we talked about Mercer. He told me about meeting Mercer. And the discussion was how does

122
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,480
he make this money? And the medallion fund versus the public fund is incredibly disproportionate

123
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:40,200
of the profits. It's ridiculous. 23 billion split between 100 and three people. So we figured,

124
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,320
I think this actually meant Matt Mosk for us now because that's why I brought up the Ponzi scheme

125
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,080
idea. But he said he sat down and spoke with Mercer and Mercer explained to him that he had

126
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:58,960
adapted an algorithm for speech recognition for the stock markets. And Bob Roach is so confident,

127
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,920
like that's clearly what it is. And I'm hearing it's like, this is what you tell an idiot when

128
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,000
you want to just say something fintechy and then everyone that doesn't understand anything about

129
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,280
algorithms or computers, oh yes, of course, that must be it. And I couldn't believe that Bob Roach

130
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,480
bought this slide. I was like, Bob, like, come on, think about it. If this had happened, I mean,

131
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,920
maybe in the 90s, when people, the markets would have been cornered by millions of people. He's

132
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,400
not the only person in the world. I mean, these ideas just think it's not one person that has this

133
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,760
idea that they're naturally come up together, like a paradigm shift or zeitgeist ideas happen

134
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,040
like this. You know, it's not just he's been holding onto this since the 90s. It's bullshit.

135
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,560
No one can corner a market because of a fucking algorithm that they wrote. It's like the Bad

136
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,800
James Bond film. He's like, no, I really believe he's he was a military intelligence. I don't

137
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,280
care if he's a military intelligence. It's bullshit. It can't it's not happening. It's not what the

138
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,200
real story is. We had it. I don't want you to come to their entire business. Ransom's entire business

139
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,200
is designing very sophisticated trading strategies based on finding little inefficiencies in the

140
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:08,840
market based on algorithms. And not for me. He's not making hundreds of billions of dollars

141
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,280
because he's cornered the stock market based on an algorithm designed to first speak originally

142
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,480
designed for speech recognition. It's bullshit. And there's no evidence of that. No one's ever

143
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,920
seen any of these any of this code. No, it's just a bunch of bullshit. Fentucky shit people.

144
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,680
You say to somebody when you don't want to tell the truth, I will stick with this story forever.

145
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,400
It will come out one day. It will come out one day. Okay. People think other people agree with me.

146
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,720
Some people think it's a big Ponzi scheme. The cover story for it. Okay. So let's move on.

147
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,560
You know people being Glenn and Matt Mosk. Good. Yeah. Okay.

148
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:01,560
Okay. So you agree to leave Roach with some bundle of documents, right? Okay. Selection.

149
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,760
Okay. Mostly for the stuff he personally wanted. I like that Fed letter I gave you.

150
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:17,480
Yeah. Et cetera. Oh, he dope. And you left him the spreadsheet too, right? That MTO.

151
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,120
No, I don't think I gave him that. Really? I think. I discovered that way later, like six or seven

152
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,520
months later. Well, but it would have been in the files. I gave to Glenn, but I didn't specifically

153
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,560
look at it and give it to him. Okay. If he has it, it must have been, or focused on it,

154
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:44,040
must have been from Glenn directly. Okay. Okay. So a week or so later, you rent, you rent some

155
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,640
Pathfinder, drive to Philadelphia, get a few grams of China white. Is that right? Yeah. Okay.

156
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:59,640
And head up to New York. Yeah. To meet John Moskow. Yep. Okay. And it,

157
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:11,240
so you that one evening go to the offices, that is nice big corner office, and it,

158
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:20,840
um, what a character he is. What a character he is. What a character that guy is. Yeah.

159
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,600
Yeah. He is a character. Yeah. I mean, so are you. Yeah. Two of you together in a room is

160
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,720
something I would have paid good money to witness. I like to think I'm a good character.

161
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,800
You are. I don't think John Moskow is above the line. Good guy. Okay. So

162
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:49,000
you're a little high in this meeting. Yeah. No. No more so than usual. No. Okay. And so you go,

163
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,400
you give your whole, uh, spiel that you've practiced many times, you've done many times at

164
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,600
this point. He's impressed. He asked for a look and you kind of do a little multimedia presentation

165
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,800
room with your laptop and your iPad. Okay. Um, Glenn's computer at this point, because my

166
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,960
computer is still in somewhere at this point, this had a crack screen, so we had to go, I had

167
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,680
to plug in this external screen. So I said, that's why I have Glenn's computers. Like, look, man,

168
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,720
I just use this fucking computer. So yeah, fine. Go for it. Okay. So, um,

169
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,960
uh, and Moskow asked if he can have a copy of the files and you at this point balk because

170
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,920
you're being too worried that you're like just handing this out to a new asked and, uh, so you

171
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,120
offer Moskow a trade. But I also asked Moskow, why are you asking for the files? Glenn sent me

172
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,840
up here. He's got the fucking files. Yeah. Why do, why can't you just get them from Glenn? It just,

173
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:51,000
it didn't make sense. Um, well, he wanted them for himself. Yeah. But why couldn't he just say, Glenn,

174
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,360
can you send me, we have as much easier to just get them right. Right. Anyway, so you guys offer,

175
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,800
you offer trade, which is that they'll help, um, represent you against Deutsche Bank. Yeah.

176
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,360
For wrongful death. Yeah, but why go through all this trouble for two days courting me to get

177
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,200
the files? If you get it just called Glenn? Yeah. Well, what do you think? I don't know. Okay. I don't

178
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,280
know. Um, he, so Moskow tells you he needs to think about that overnight. So you come back the

179
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,560
next afternoon and he says, no, they're not going to represent you. And so you guys make a different

180
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,720
agreement, which is that he will, or someone at the firm, uh, can provide legal advice to you

181
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,560
in your fight with your mom. Yeah. Okay. And I go for three, Avis, Deutsche Bank, and the family

182
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,800
estate. Right. But that's not what he ultimately agrees to, right? He agrees to the family estate.

183
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,640
Right. He agrees to the family estate. Yeah. He's the next, the other two. Yeah. And the second day.

184
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,040
Um, and so you accept that and someone comes in with a new, uh, what's your name called,

185
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,000
thumb drive and downloads a bunch of shit. Yeah. Okay. You open it up from the package to make

186
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,440
sure it wasn't put some spot where on my computer. It's the whole thing. Yeah. Well, I insisted

187
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,200
it on that too. I didn't trust it. Um, I mean, look at this office is filled with CIA fucking papers

188
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,800
and shaking hands with CIA directors. Okay. So I don't know if I've told you, I think I have told

189
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,560
you this, but they're NSA, you know what Moskow does with that thumb drive, right? Uh, you tell me,

190
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,240
I gave it, it gives it to that weird dude on YouTube. Right. Exactly. The New York Fed guy.

191
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,360
Um, okay. And this is like one of those places where, I mean, I, this is correlation,

192
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,440
not causation, but this is one of those moments where what you did actually might have had some

193
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,240
impact because it ends up in the hands of the New York Fed and the hands of this forensic

194
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,360
investigator who at that moment is investigating Deutsche Bank and money laundering. And a few

195
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:52,760
months later, um, almost four months later, the Fed does this cease and desist order with Deutsche

196
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,400
for Russian money laundering. Um, yeah. Well, it's not specifically for the marriage. It's for

197
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,040
Russia. It's for money laundering in general, but yeah, it was the Cyprus. It doesn't go,

198
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:13,160
it doesn't name a single country. Um, okay. Okay. Meanwhile, you and Glenn have a following out.

199
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:21,480
He views you as irresponsible and annoying and spending too much. You view him as owning you

200
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,880
a bunch of money and don't think you've done anything wrong. He says you're acting like a vagabond.

201
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,600
You say, don't talk to me like you're my father. And he says, well, you need someone to act like

202
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:41,320
your father. Pretty much. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. I don't know why people tend to do these father

203
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:48,120
rules at me. I'm going to be, I'll be your father figure. Again, if this was the Odyssey, Glenn

204
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,280
would be the Cyclops. But where are you going? Can we just, we're almost done because I just

205
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:03,560
want to draw this like, tie this in a nice bow. Okay. Like, I think to me it's not coincidental.

206
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,240
Actually, John Moscow would be the Cyclops because he's got one eye. He doesn't have one eye. He has

207
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,440
two eyes. He's got one bad eye, one glass eye. He does a, is it glass eye? Yeah. I don't know about

208
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:21,400
that. He certainly has whatever it doesn't. He does. Ask him. No, I think I'll pass on asking

209
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:29,080
that. I am like making something of the fact that this is not the first time that someone has

210
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,880
kind of stepped into the father figure role. And I think this dialogue you guys have, especially

211
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,680
given that you've spent that time on wherever you were out in the countryside together talking about

212
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:47,720
your dads, it's, those words seem, those words from Glenn seem intended to draw some blood.

213
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,960
Yeah, I think so. A lot of words from Glenn, true blood, purposely. Like what else?

214
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,560
I don't know. It's talking about his father getting on the GI bill after World War II.

215
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,600
In other words, Glenn did. Glenn's trying to send me to a journalist school in Berkeley.

216
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,520
There's a lot. Wait, why was I trying to draw blood? No, no, not, I'm just going over their

217
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,680
conversations. The whole Steele dossier stuff, we talked about that. There was a lot of just like

218
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:29,080
punches about getting to work and bunkering down. And him talking to you like you weren't?

219
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,320
Yeah, yeah, just like a standard cliche father son bullshit. And of course, remember, he accuses me

220
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,800
of being a Russian spy, but turns out to be his son. So in a sense, there's a

221
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,920
subconscious association there too with Glenn and myself and father son again. But anyway,

222
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,960
he draws a lot of blood. And if I could show you that I have it all, most of the blood is in the

223
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,120
texting. So that's why I'm bringing those up too. I don't think I sent you the last few texts that

224
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,160
we had. That's pretty angry. Yeah, no, I think you did. I did. Yeah, I think so. I mean, we're

225
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:07,240
going to take a look at another point. Okay, so there's a bunch of other shit in here that's not

226
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:14,760
of any relevance to you. And but ultimately, for the record, Glenn is a good guy. Like he's a good

227
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,000
person. And he's on the right side. Well, you say that about everyone. Well, everyone's inherently

228
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,120
pretty good, except for the really bad people. You say that about everyone except for your mom.

229
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:30,120
And and and you say that in an apologetic way about people who have like really mistreated you

230
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,600
and burned you. I don't understand it. Yeah. Seriously, Samantha Sheldon has not treated you

231
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:46,840
well. You know, you're right. Glenn, like by your telling has like, you know, withheld money from

232
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,400
you and just burned you, it is slandering you. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You said the

233
00:22:51,400 --> 00:23:00,200
same thing. You're right. I do that a lot. Why? I don't know. I don't want to live in anger and hate

234
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,320
people at times. Everyone's got their quirks. It's forgivable. It's something you didn't do

235
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:13,880
anything that's unforgivable. I don't think the handler did either. You know, it's ups and it's

236
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:20,360
good and bad for everything. It's mostly gray area. Not everyone is 100% good 100% bad. It's

237
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,600
a gray area with your mom. Not right now. I'm still really mad at her. Yeah, but I'm sure there is

238
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,440
if I wasn't so angry, blinded by anger. But yeah, I'm sure. Okay. We're at 7 o'clock. Do you want

239
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,080
to take a break or do you want to go? Yeah, I'll see you right here. Good afternoon.
