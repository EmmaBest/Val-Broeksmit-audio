you're running out of money you decide to migrate south yeah so you brief time

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:13,160
in Athens where I saw Dmitri right we saw Dmitri and it also had trouble

29
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,160
lining up like acquiring drugs yes terrible that country was it's terrible

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,440
for prescription drugs okay then you move on to Rome had to get out of there

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,160
fast yes you move on to Rome you're renting a room in San Giovanni yeah

32
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:38,800
okay and then someone we will describe as Samantha Sheldon she identifies

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,320
herself as a reporter with the FT yes and said she's heard about him heard

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,480
about you sorry from another journalist and was interested in writing about you

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,200
in your story and so she flies from London to Rome on New Year's Eve well

36
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,440
should we say London I mean that's where the FT is based what can we just say

37
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:10,440
flies from a different country flies from out of the region flies from across

38
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,680
some water a body of water to Rome that makes the effort to fly from a faraway

39
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,920
country because we're giving it to me clues we say London and now it's all

40
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,680
in camera so thanks David well I don't know what's the problem with she's

41
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,440
identified herself as an FT reporter the FT is in London okay but we don't have

42
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,920
to say because it's just you there's many different offices FT there's FT in

43
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,680
Berlin there's FT in Nuremberg I mean not Nuremberg but another German place

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
there's FT offices all over the fucking world we'll discuss it later because we

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,520
discuss this person's identity okay so she flies to Rome on New Year's Eve you

46
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,400
spend the night wandering the city and you tell your story for it sorry FT in

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,120
Frankfurt not in Nuremberg but yeah sorry it really doesn't matter no it

48
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,240
does not just okay she you're telling your story walking around the city she's

49
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,080
recording that on her phone and kind of interrupting from time to time to point

50
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,600
out like ruined or church is kind of giving you a little history tour you

51
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,800
occasionally excuse yourself to the bathroom for oxy you end up at the

52
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,760
Colosseum right for midnight fireworks beautiful and you didn't spend New Year's

53
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,160
Day roaming as well and finally you've kind of developed a bond with her and

54
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,040
offer her a look inside your father's files she leaves Rome lies back to

55
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,640
wherever and prostitutes back in touch right okay so a couple days later or

56
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,160
few days later you leave Rome and head to Lisbon because a lot less expensive

57
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,280
obviously no I was sort of parted out I mean Rome was fun Rome was a good time

58
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,160
and there's a couple of things we missed with my others another FT guy that got

59
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,680
ahold of me forgot his name I had pictures of him he came to Nuremberg to

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
meet me for to look over some files I had about Monty Poskey specifically James

61
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:21,160
Schauder I said to TTR so when she said she was from FT Samantha Sheldon I thought

62
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,040
oh maybe it was from James Schauder that she got the information but she never

63
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,400
heard of James Schauder apparently so that was no that sort of made me more

64
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,240
comfortable worth of the FT and I've heard James Schauder you've heard James

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,480
like regular byline in the FT really yeah the odds of Samantha Sheldon work

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,320
at the FT and had not did not know a person like that is I would say

67
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,400
impossible well and so she told me so but that's what I had thought originally

68
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,800
that she did that's where they got my information okay so you're partied out

69
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,760
you move to Lisbon right you go to Lisbon you get another Airbnb room no

70
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,200
but remember this is there's a good stories here because I actually spent

71
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,600
time playing music live at the place called San Belushi like name of John

72
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,880
Belushi is a Italians love John Belushi so the name is bar called San

73
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,080
Belushi and they invite me to play every fucking every night it was fun and I

74
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,040
played and I jammed with all these great Italian musicians and there's a

75
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,000
couple of famous Italian actors too and I got a bar fights and right broke out

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,400
I was playing piano for the riot just for fun it's really high and there's

77
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,240
beautiful girl I think I sang her info too and it was fun it was a lot of fun

78
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,320
and then Landon starts calling me around the same time and Landon wants to do

79
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,480
the story this is prior to Samantha Sheldon showing up and Landon and I are

80
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,480
working on the story for Deutsche Bank and when it gets published in the

81
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,000
year's day I'm a bit upset and the Samantha Sheldon is aware of the story

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
being published as well be careful be careful

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,920
listen here at times Landon Thomas seems like a big guy knows what he's doing

84
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,560
it's upset with the story because it was not very well written this wasn't

85
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,240
exactly what I expected it was really it just sort of me under didn't have any

86
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,800
purpose so I was a bit upset with him about it I let him know I sent you the

87
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,080
emails I sent him he lied and told me that he had permission from Anshu to

88
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,400
quote from the note I said I would only give you the note if you get Anshu's

89
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,680
permission you need to just why don't you just get it from Anshu he's gonna keep

90
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,160
your permission but if he does not want to share with you personally I need you

91
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,440
to call him and get permission because I'm not gonna do it for you and he said

92
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,360
yes I talked to Anshu and Anshu said can you use selections from the note that he

93
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,560
left your father I said okay then go for it and so I okayed it and then the

94
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,080
story ran and then I hear from Anshu's people so we never okayed this and then

95
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,560
sent you this email too I got from Anshu's lawyers I'm not sure I think I

96
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,800
sent it to Vile sent it again and they said we did not okay this with Landon and

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,040
yeah but just in etc. just to play devil's advocate it's not I mean I have no

98
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,840
idea what happened yeah it would not be the first time that someone in the

99
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,080
situation of Anshu's people would have lied I'm not saying that is what happened

100
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,480
I have no idea but it's no but Landon backtrack said I didn't hear from Anshu

101
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
directly I heard from his lawyers yeah but they made it seem like it was okay

102
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,920
Landon that's very different than saying Anshu said it was okay and it's very

103
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,880
upset about it I wrote a whole thing I want to give it to the fucking editors

104
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,760
New York Times but I didn't cuz I wanted to spare Landon it's like it's a poor

105
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,440
landing I didn't want to destroy his I didn't want to get him in trouble I just

106
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,040
wanted to let him know I was upset so I wrote the letter to the other and just

107
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,560
gave it to him and this is why I'm upset I'm not gonna send it to anyone else but

108
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,560
I want you to know this is piss me off for future things that you did okay so yes

143
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,920
Glenn sometimes comes across a bit mysterious yeah a little bit I mean

144
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,600
especially if you haven't met him so I mean just do my research on him before

145
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,320
for I meet him who's kind of like okay maybe he's a little shady I don't know

146
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,120
if I trust this guy sending me to some you know weird place in Texas because he
