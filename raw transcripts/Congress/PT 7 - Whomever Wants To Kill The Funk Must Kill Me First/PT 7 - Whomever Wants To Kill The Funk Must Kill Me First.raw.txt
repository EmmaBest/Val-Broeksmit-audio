[02:09.280 --> 02:16.640]  you started to me Riverside hotel Riverside focus okay the whole world
[02:16.640 --> 02:34.960]  gone mad yes and you start soon after that calls from reporters you've been
[02:35.120 --> 02:38.980]  with over the past couple years wondering what if anything you have on
[02:38.980 --> 02:45.320]  Trump including yourself did I yeah maybe and your quick search turned up
[02:45.320 --> 02:53.120]  nothing okay so I mean all I did was search Trump yeah I had no idea what
[02:53.120 --> 03:00.320]  understood okay so your mom as you said has cancelled her credit cards and
[03:00.360 --> 03:05.600]  you're running out of money you decide to migrate south yeah so you brief time
[03:05.600 --> 03:13.160]  in Athens where I saw Dmitri right we saw Dmitri and it also had trouble
[03:13.160 --> 03:19.160]  lining up like acquiring drugs yes terrible that country was it's terrible
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.440]  for prescription drugs okay then you move on to Rome had to get out of there
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.160]  fast yes you move on to Rome you're renting a room in San Giovanni yeah
[03:29.800 --> 03:38.800]  okay and then someone we will describe as Samantha Sheldon she identifies
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.320]  herself as a reporter with the FT yes and said she's heard about him heard
[03:43.320 --> 03:48.480]  about you sorry from another journalist and was interested in writing about you
[03:48.480 --> 03:56.200]  in your story and so she flies from London to Rome on New Year's Eve well
[03:56.200 --> 04:02.440]  should we say London I mean that's where the FT is based what can we just say
[04:02.440 --> 04:10.440]  flies from a different country flies from out of the region flies from across
[04:10.440 --> 04:16.680]  some water a body of water to Rome that makes the effort to fly from a faraway
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.920]  country because we're giving it to me clues we say London and now it's all
[04:20.920 --> 04:26.680]  in camera so thanks David well I don't know what's the problem with she's
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.440]  identified herself as an FT reporter the FT is in London okay but we don't have
[04:30.440 --> 04:33.920]  to say because it's just you there's many different offices FT there's FT in
[04:33.920 --> 04:39.680]  Berlin there's FT in Nuremberg I mean not Nuremberg but another German place
[04:39.680 --> 04:43.280]  there's FT offices all over the fucking world we'll discuss it later because we
[04:43.440 --> 04:49.520]  discuss this person's identity okay so she flies to Rome on New Year's Eve you
[04:49.520 --> 04:54.400]  spend the night wandering the city and you tell your story for it sorry FT in
[04:54.400 --> 05:02.120]  Frankfurt not in Nuremberg but yeah sorry it really doesn't matter no it
[05:02.120 --> 05:07.240]  does not just okay she you're telling your story walking around the city she's
[05:07.240 --> 05:11.080]  recording that on her phone and kind of interrupting from time to time to point
[05:11.120 --> 05:14.600]  out like ruined or church is kind of giving you a little history tour you
[05:14.600 --> 05:19.800]  occasionally excuse yourself to the bathroom for oxy you end up at the
[05:19.800 --> 05:25.760]  Colosseum right for midnight fireworks beautiful and you didn't spend New Year's
[05:25.760 --> 05:31.160]  Day roaming as well and finally you've kind of developed a bond with her and
[05:31.160 --> 05:38.040]  offer her a look inside your father's files she leaves Rome lies back to
[05:38.040 --> 05:43.640]  wherever and prostitutes back in touch right okay so a couple days later or
[05:43.640 --> 05:49.160]  few days later you leave Rome and head to Lisbon because a lot less expensive
[05:49.160 --> 05:54.280]  obviously no I was sort of parted out I mean Rome was fun Rome was a good time
[05:54.280 --> 05:58.160]  and there's a couple of things we missed with my others another FT guy that got
[05:58.160 --> 06:04.680]  ahold of me forgot his name I had pictures of him he came to Nuremberg to
[06:04.720 --> 06:09.120]  meet me for to look over some files I had about Monty Poskey specifically James
[06:09.120 --> 06:21.160]  Schauder I said to TTR so when she said she was from FT Samantha Sheldon I thought
[06:21.160 --> 06:26.040]  oh maybe it was from James Schauder that she got the information but she never
[06:26.040 --> 06:30.400]  heard of James Schauder apparently so that was no that sort of made me more
[06:30.400 --> 06:33.240]  comfortable worth of the FT and I've heard James Schauder you've heard James
[06:33.560 --> 06:38.480]  like regular byline in the FT really yeah the odds of Samantha Sheldon work
[06:38.480 --> 06:43.320]  at the FT and had not did not know a person like that is I would say
[06:43.320 --> 06:48.400]  impossible well and so she told me so but that's what I had thought originally
[06:48.400 --> 06:52.800]  that she did that's where they got my information okay so you're partied out
[06:52.800 --> 06:57.760]  you move to Lisbon right you go to Lisbon you get another Airbnb room no
[06:57.760 --> 07:01.200]  but remember this is there's a good stories here because I actually spent
[07:01.240 --> 07:06.600]  time playing music live at the place called San Belushi like name of John
[07:06.600 --> 07:09.880]  Belushi is a Italians love John Belushi so the name is bar called San
[07:09.880 --> 07:15.080]  Belushi and they invite me to play every fucking every night it was fun and I
[07:15.080 --> 07:20.040]  played and I jammed with all these great Italian musicians and there's a
[07:20.040 --> 07:25.000]  couple of famous Italian actors too and I got a bar fights and right broke out
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.400]  I was playing piano for the riot just for fun it's really high and there's
[07:29.440 --> 07:35.240]  beautiful girl I think I sang her info too and it was fun it was a lot of fun
[07:35.240 --> 07:40.320]  and then Landon starts calling me around the same time and Landon wants to do
[07:40.320 --> 07:47.480]  the story this is prior to Samantha Sheldon showing up and Landon and I are
[07:47.480 --> 07:52.480]  working on the story for Deutsche Bank and when it gets published in the
[07:52.480 --> 07:57.000]  year's day I'm a bit upset and the Samantha Sheldon is aware of the story
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  being published as well be careful be careful
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.920]  listen here at times Landon Thomas seems like a big guy knows what he's doing
[08:03.920 --> 08:07.560]  it's upset with the story because it was not very well written this wasn't
[08:07.560 --> 08:11.240]  exactly what I expected it was really it just sort of me under didn't have any
[08:11.240 --> 08:16.800]  purpose so I was a bit upset with him about it I let him know I sent you the
[08:16.800 --> 08:22.080]  emails I sent him he lied and told me that he had permission from Anshu to
[08:22.080 --> 08:25.400]  quote from the note I said I would only give you the note if you get Anshu's
[08:25.400 --> 08:29.680]  permission you need to just why don't you just get it from Anshu he's gonna keep
[08:29.680 --> 08:33.160]  your permission but if he does not want to share with you personally I need you
[08:33.160 --> 08:36.440]  to call him and get permission because I'm not gonna do it for you and he said
[08:36.440 --> 08:41.360]  yes I talked to Anshu and Anshu said can you use selections from the note that he
[08:41.360 --> 08:46.560]  left your father I said okay then go for it and so I okayed it and then the
[08:46.560 --> 08:51.080]  story ran and then I hear from Anshu's people so we never okayed this and then
[08:51.080 --> 08:56.560]  sent you this email too I got from Anshu's lawyers I'm not sure I think I
[08:56.560 --> 09:01.800]  sent it to Vile sent it again and they said we did not okay this with Landon and
[09:01.800 --> 09:07.040]  yeah but just in etc. just to play devil's advocate it's not I mean I have no
[09:07.040 --> 09:11.840]  idea what happened yeah it would not be the first time that someone in the
[09:11.840 --> 09:15.080]  situation of Anshu's people would have lied I'm not saying that is what happened
[09:15.080 --> 09:18.480]  I have no idea but it's no but Landon backtrack said I didn't hear from Anshu
[09:18.480 --> 09:22.640]  directly I heard from his lawyers yeah but they made it seem like it was okay
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.920]  Landon that's very different than saying Anshu said it was okay and it's very
[09:26.920 --> 09:29.880]  upset about it I wrote a whole thing I want to give it to the fucking editors
[09:29.880 --> 09:35.760]  New York Times but I didn't cuz I wanted to spare Landon it's like it's a poor
[09:35.760 --> 09:40.440]  landing I didn't want to destroy his I didn't want to get him in trouble I just
[09:40.440 --> 09:43.040]  wanted to let him know I was upset so I wrote the letter to the other and just
[09:43.040 --> 09:46.560]  gave it to him and this is why I'm upset I'm not gonna send it to anyone else but
[09:46.560 --> 09:54.560]  I want you to know this is piss me off for future things that you did okay so yes
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.600]  you go to Lisbon go to Lisbon you're renting an Airbnb room yes okay money
[09:59.600 --> 10:06.880]  and oxy nearly exhausted yes what are you gonna do you call Sheldon I'm in
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.800]  trouble you say but keep in mind Sheldon I've been talking like a couple times a
[10:11.800 --> 10:17.160]  week yep yeah constant texting well this is much later right this is like this
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.880]  is a maybe month it's less than a month well yeah it's about a month no it's
[10:20.880 --> 10:26.720]  less than a month like it's probably three or four weeks later so you you call
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.440]  her you say I'm in trouble I don't know what to do you need money you don't have
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.600]  anything to your name other than your dad yeah I said at this point like is there
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.040]  anyone you know that would be interested in buying this stuff like I can maybe I
[10:38.040 --> 10:43.400]  could monetize yeah instead of giving everything away for free she calls back
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.480]  she says she has an idea she called back in a couple hours says I have someone
[10:47.480 --> 10:51.600]  who might be willing to pay he's looking for stuff against Trump right you say

[13:04.920 --> 13:08.600]  especially if you haven't met him so I mean just do my research on him before
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.320]  for I meet him who's kind of like okay maybe he's a little shady I don't know
