0	4000	I mean these aren't going to be synced up at all, like this is going to be a mess from right?
4000	6000	No, I mean it'll be easy.
6000	8000	It'll be so easy for them to sync it up.
8000	9000	Um...
9000	10000	It's not difficult.
10000	11000	Okay.
12000	13000	Um...
14000	15000	Okay.
15000	16000	Let's see.
17000	18000	Alright, so...
18000	19000	1145.
19000	20000	Yeah.
22000	24000	He gets up, gets himself out of bed.
24000	25000	Okay.
25000	27000	Pulls on jeans, buttoned down shirt.
27000	29000	Rain is falling.
30000	32000	Water dripping down the windows.
32000	34000	Warping his view of the world outside.
34000	36000	So it was raining, I was right.
37000	38000	Yeah.
38000	39000	Um...
39000	40000	I remember seeing rain in Chelsea.
40000	41000	It was raining.
41000	42000	Yeah.
42000	43000	Uh...
44000	48000	Bill's latest Sunday routine of going to the cafe for coffee, newspapers, people watching.
48000	50000	Bill says no thanks.
50000	52000	All leaves.
52000	54000	Not super happy with Bill.
54000	56000	That he's flaking out.
56000	58000	Um...
58000	60000	It's 1145.
60000	63000	Door to the building clicks, the last clocks.
66000	69000	Bill gets the letters from the hiding place.
69000	71000	Put some in Daisy's bed.
72000	75000	Wait, he gets the letters from the hiding place?
75000	76000	They were written in advance.
76000	77000	They were written in advance?
77000	78000	Yeah.
78000	79000	How far in advance?
79000	80000	I don't know.
80000	81000	How do you know this?
81000	85000	Because I've looked at the letters and I've looked at a clock.
85000	86000	And there's no...
86000	91000	It is physically impossible for him to have written those letters
91000	94000	and done what he's about to do in the time allowed.
94000	96000	Have you tried it?
96000	98000	I've eyeballed it.
98000	99000	There is...
99000	101000	He wrote seven letters.
101000	102000	Okay.
102000	103000	Including one that was at least ten pages long.
103000	104000	Right.
104000	105000	Okay.
105000	107000	There's no way he did that in...
107000	108000	And there were drops.
108000	109000	In 45 minutes.
109000	111000	But I saw drops thrown away in the trash bin.
112000	113000	Um...
114000	115000	Maybe he did half and half.
115000	116000	Maybe he wrote some before.
116000	118000	What do you think, the night before?
118000	119000	I have no idea.
119000	120000	Okay.
120000	121000	There were...
121000	122000	Takes Daisy's red leash.
122000	123000	Okay.
123000	126000	Attaches one end to the handle on the front shores.
126000	129000	Arcs the leash over the top of the doors.
129000	131000	Ties the other around his neck.
131000	132000	Make sure it's secure.
132000	133000	Lunges forward.
133000	134000	Okay.
136000	138000	40 minutes after the shoe lap.
138000	140000	All it comes back.
140000	142000	Climbed stairs.
142000	144000	Walks into the apartment.
144000	146000	Bill's hanging.
146000	149000	She calls 999.
149000	151000	Dispatcher says help is on its way.
151000	153000	Goes into the kitchen.
153000	155000	Grabs a knife.
155000	157000	And a small ladder.
157000	158000	Climbs up the ladder.
158000	159000	Slices the leash.
159000	160000	Bill crashes to the floor.
160000	162000	All the world's his body.
162000	164000	She tries CPR.
164000	165000	Doesn't work.
165000	167000	Paramedics arrive at 1231.
167000	170000	Which is three minutes after the radio calling out.
170000	173000	All they find are all a crouched over bill.
173000	174000	Trying CPR.
174000	177000	But screaming too much for it to be effective.
177000	178000	They take over.
178000	181000	And the EMT removes the leash from Bill's neck.
181000	183000	Checks for breathing and pulse.
183000	184000	Doesn't find either.
184000	186000	Clamps on a neck brace.
186000	189000	Inserts a tube into Bill's throat to open his obstructive airway.
189000	191000	Starts pumping in oxygen.
191000	193000	Another paramedic hooks up an IV with adrenaline.
193000	197000	Someone radius for a helicopter ambulance.
197000	198000	It's too late.
198000	199000	One o'clock.
199000	201000	He's pronounced life extent.
201000	204000	All of us manages to say that he'd been depressed
204000	206000	and was taking hard medication.
206000	208000	Paramex being packed in their equipment.
208000	210000	You arrive 10 minutes later.
210000	214000	Paramex tells you that police are on their way.
214000	215000	You're in a haze.
215000	217000	You don't really understand why.
217000	219000	Figure you should document the scene.
219000	222000	He snaps some photos.
222000	224000	Bill's like draped in a white bathrobe.
224000	227000	And his head and neck and arms are all sticking out perpendicular to his body.
227000	231000	Looking a little bit like you've been crucified.
231000	233000	What?
233000	235000	You know?
235000	236000	I've seen the pictures.
236000	237000	Crucified?
237000	239000	White bathrobe.
239000	241000	There's a white bit.
241000	243000	Oh, over on top of him.
243000	245000	His head and neck and arms are sticking out.
245000	246000	Right.
246000	248000	Yes, they opened up...
248000	250000	Yes, food.
250000	251000	I can't remember why.
251000	253000	But yeah, his arms are out.
253000	254000	Okay.
254000	256000	Crucified.
256000	260000	Okay.
260000	267000	Coffee table has the DBTCA paperwork that had come in the DHL package a few days earlier.
267000	271000	Top of the pile is a letter before I didn't brief over you.
271000	273000	You thumb through the papers.
273000	276000	DBTCA, the acronym DBTCA keeps popping up.
276000	278000	You have no idea what that stands for.
278000	281000	Someone finds the letters in Daisy's bed.
281000	288000	Alla, Alessa, Kushka, you, Mom, Anchu, Michael Miranda.
288000	292000	You open yours, single piece of printer paper.
292000	294000	Read the letter.
294000	297000	Stuff back in the envelope.
297000	300000	Nothing really sunk in.
300000	303000	Alla tells you to call someone for help.
303000	304000	It was you, Faisola's number.
304000	309000	You're under the impression that it's a family lawyer, not one of Bill's Deutsche colleagues.
309000	310000	I know.
310000	311000	I say, we need some help.
311000	313000	I say, we need to call someone.
313000	314000	Do we have a lawyer?
314000	315000	Okay.
315000	316000	So I don't want to say that.
316000	317000	Okay, that's good.
317000	320000	And she says, why would we be talking?
320000	321000	We need a lawyer.
321000	322000	The police are coming.
322000	323000	The police are coming.
323000	324000	Who's our lawyer?
324000	325000	Do we have a family lawyer?
325000	327000	It's like, call McKaley.
327000	328000	Call McKaley.
328000	329000	Okay.
329000	330000	Good.
330000	331000	That's good.
331000	335000	I say, who's McKaley?
335000	338000	And I think it was either her phone or my dad's phone.
338000	339000	Search through.
339000	340000	I give it to my mom.
340000	344000	She searched through it between click-solving and stuff.
344000	345000	She stops crying for a minute.
345000	349000	She finds the phone number, hands it to me, and then I call.
349000	352000	I don't remember if I called from the phone or I call it from my phone.
352000	353000	I don't remember.
353000	354000	I just remember calling.
354000	358000	And then she starts crying again when the phone left her hand.
358000	359000	Okay.
359000	360000	Let me kind of interrupt real fast.
360000	361000	Do we have any more light?
361000	363000	We could have a pyramid in chance.
363000	365000	I feel like this is getting a little...
365000	370000	Maybe if we just...
370000	371000	You know what I mean?
371000	372000	Yeah.
372000	373000	How does it look?
373000	374000	It's dark.
374000	375000	Excuse me.
375000	377000	I think we should...
377000	379000	Do you have those lamps that you could put over?
379000	380000	Yeah.
380000	381000	Here.
381000	382000	Let me just pause this for a sec.
382000	383000	Okay.
383000	385000	Is there a pause in my phone too?
385000	386000	Yep.
386000	387000	We'll do it.
387000	391000	This lets me...
391000	392000	Okay.
392000	393000	Okay.
394000	396000	So you call Faisola.
396000	398000	You say, this is Val, William's son.
398000	399000	We need your help.
399000	400000	My dad is dead.
400000	404000	And he rushes over and is there very quickly.
404000	405000	Yeah.
405000	408000	Police arrive.
408000	414000	Your mom is curled on the floor, stroking Bill's head and brushing hair out of his closed eyes and crying.
414000	416000	And you put your arm around her.
416000	420000	I'm brushing hair out of his closed eyes because his eyes kept opening.
420000	423000	I remember she kept closing them.
423000	424000	Okay.
424000	426000	That's good.
426000	431000	You put your arm around her and her crying kind of quiet.
431000	435000	So it occurred to you at that moment that that was the first time you had really touched her.
435000	438000	Not just in passing, since you were a child.
438000	441000	And you said to yourself, well, this is a little weird.
441000	445000	Got kind of self-conscious and removed your arm and walked away and her crying.
445000	446000	And she felt the same.
446000	448000	You could tell she stopped crying too.
448000	450000	Maybe it was just comforting.
450000	452000	No, I don't think so.
452000	456000	It was just awkward for both of us.
456000	462000	Cops come and inspect the suicide notes and they ask you to verify the handwriting.
462000	466000	And you said, you can't look at them.
466000	468000	The cop told them you have to.
468000	471000	And you looked again and burst into tears.
471000	474000	And then the officer hands you another note.
474000	475000	And you turn away.
475000	476000	I'm not going to do it.
476000	477000	He says, just push on.
477000	479000	You don't have to read every sentence.
479000	482000	And so you peeked at each note and confirmed your father had written them,
482000	487000	but didn't actually really look at the words.
487000	492000	Beth, meanwhile, had been in Wales that weekend for her mom's birthday.
492000	494000	It was on a bus back to London.
494000	501000	And it was like just kind of like angry at you because you hadn't been responding to our text messages.
501000	505000	And she was like, what is wrong with my unreliable boyfriend?
505000	508000	And finally, we've had it.
508000	509000	Yeah, I forgot.
509000	510000	Yeah.
510000	514000	This has been a point of some memory problems.
514000	518000	I'm inclined to trust her recollection over years.
518000	521000	I didn't party the night before.
521000	525000	No, you had originally said that you and Beth were together the night before.
525000	526000	I thought so.
526000	530000	And then you reconciled this once Beth told me this,
531000	536000	that you had been with your bandmates and your friends like partying the night before or at a club or something.
536000	537000	Something like that.
537000	540000	Or maybe just recording at night.
540000	541000	I don't remember anymore.
541000	543000	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
543000	548000	Well, it doesn't matter, but I'm fairly confident that what I've gotten, we've worked on it a lot.
548000	554000	So finally, you replied to one of her texts and say, my dad is dead.
554000	562000	And her immediate assumption is that it's Alexander who's dead and you'd somehow just gotten worse.
562000	565000	It didn't occur to her that Bill was dead.
565000	569000	And she called you and heard that no, it was Bill who's dead.
569000	572000	Alexander, I don't think I could talk about him with her.
572000	574000	Maybe once or twice.
574000	577000	Her point is that it didn't make any sense that your dad was dead.
577000	578000	Right.
578000	580000	What were you talking about?
580000	586000	She'd just been with your dad at that gospel choir in the restaurant.
586000	596000	So she gets back to London and gets an overnight bag, comes over to Evelyn Gardens.
596000	598000	You meet her outside.
598000	599000	And the police are gone.
599000	601000	The coroner's removed the body.
601000	603000	And it's just like sad and miserable.
603000	608000	And Faisola's over there and his wife Maria.
608000	615000	And at that point, Faisola says, you guys go into your dad's office, like apartment, right?
615000	616000	He's just two apartments.
616000	617000	Yeah, across the hall.
617000	621000	And it says, Faisola says to you, is this your dad's computer?
621000	622000	Can I check some things?
622000	624000	You were in no shape to say no.
624000	627000	And you watch over his shoulder as he rummaged around on the computer.
627000	628000	And I'm noting.
628000	636000	But not again out of any sort of disdain or any sort of concern.
636000	638000	I just was like, oh, what's he looking for?
638000	640000	Maybe I can help or maybe...
640000	642000	So what I'm saying here is that...
642000	644000	Maybe there's a sensible one here that's looking for clues.
644000	645000	Let's focus on this.
645000	648000	So what I'm saying here is that this is your recollection.
648000	651000	And that you told me about this shortly after it happened.
651000	656000	But that Faisola just says it's completely not true.
656000	658000	I mean, I have no way around that.
658000	661000	You've been telling me that all along.
661000	669000	And so your mind is churning.
669000	672000	We're trying to figure out what the fuck just happened, basically.
672000	677000	You remember watching at that point a TV prison drama with your dad.
677000	680000	Where an inmate hung himself in a door handle.
680000	683000	And you and your dad had exchanged puzzled glances
683000	686000	and discussed the physics of whether that was actually possible.
686000	687000	And decided that yes it was.
687000	689000	It probably wasn't even that hard.
689000	694000	And so that night, you and Beth go to sleep in the office.
694000	697000	Or in the other apartment here.
697000	698000	In the other apartment.
698000	703000	And you spend a couple of minutes going through your dad's computer at that point.
703000	705000	And the email accounts are logged in.
705000	709000	And you figured maybe you'd find whatever the secret was that caused him to do this.
709000	710000	Another family.
710000	711000	It's deep in debt.
711000	713000	Like, who knows.
713000	717000	And you didn't find any of that.
717000	721000	But what becomes immediately clear is that your dad, just as of a few days earlier,
721000	722000	had been planning for the future.
722000	723000	There's a Utah ski trip.
723000	724000	There's the Willis.
724000	725000	Did I fall asleep?
725000	726000	Is this after I woke up?
726000	727000	This is that night.
727000	728000	Before he falls asleep.
728000	729000	No, before he falls asleep.
729000	730000	This is the way you've told me.
730000	731000	I mean, but if that's not your memory.
731000	732000	No, I was just asking.
732000	734000	I spaced out for a minute.
734000	735000	I was thinking about something else.
735000	737000	And then I said, before I fell asleep, yes.
737000	738000	I started going through the computer.
738000	739000	Yeah.
739000	742000	And you noticed, so first of all, that he'd been planning for the future.
742000	746000	And second of all, there were just enormous quantities of Deutsche Bank emails in his
746000	747000	person, in his Yahoo!
747000	748000	Gmail accounts.
748000	754000	And even as you're going through the computer at that moment, one final Deutsche Bank email
754000	756000	arrives at 8.42 p.m.
756000	762000	That's about the schedule for an upcoming DBTCA board meeting.
762000	764000	And none of this made any sense.
764000	768000	And you're just wiped out and you swallowed a handful of morphine xanax and tried to
768000	769000	fall asleep.
769000	770000	Yeah.
770000	771000	I was crying.
771000	772000	Yeah.
772000	776000	I actually had written that and then it just felt like such a cliche.
776000	781000	But yeah, I hear you.
781000	783000	You can write it better.
783000	785000	I don't know how to write it better.
785000	788000	It just, like, it almost seems like better left.
788000	789000	I don't know.
789000	790000	Yeah.
790000	791000	I don't know.
791000	792000	Okay.
792000	793000	What's up, team?
793000	795000	January 27th.
795000	799000	You're dead.
799000	803000	Death is announced to the bank by Anshu and Irrigan Fitchin.
803000	807000	The bank sends over a beefy security guy to sanitize the flat.
807000	808000	What security guy?
808000	809000	Oh yeah.
809000	810000	Beefy.
810000	811000	Yeah.
811000	812000	He was a big dude.
812000	815000	And to deal with the media, there's also a PR person.
815000	819000	And the PR person advised you guys to just not say anything.
819000	826000	And there the PR, the bank's goal at that point was to avoid any published speculation
826000	828000	about why your dad had killed himself.
828000	832000	That was the bank's goal, not your family's goal.
832000	840000	And this is something, and you know, I recount some of the dissembling or lying that the
840000	844000	bank did about what was known about your dad's death in the days afterwards.
844000	847000	Is there a split of it?
847000	853000	And it's including to me directly at the time.
853000	855000	Family, friends cycling through.
855000	861000	Alla having FaceTime conversations with the girls, sitting on the floor rocking back and
861000	862000	forth.
862000	864000	You're in a corner, not knowing what you're supposed to do.
864000	865000	You emailed Jenny.
865000	867000	Everything's upside down on sideways right now.
867000	871000	You wanted to flee the apartment, smoke cigarettes, clear your head.
871000	875000	But Alla wouldn't let you leave.
875000	881000	You were so desperate that you kind of cooked up an excuse to go get a haircut and clean
881000	882000	up.
882000	887000	And that backfired, and Alla summoned Alla's hairdresser to the apartment and used to have
887000	889000	your dad's desk and got pampered.
889000	896000	Pampered and got my haircut.
896000	897000	Hairdresser leaves.
897000	904000	Bank security man lets in a skinny tech guy from Deutsche Bank whose assignment, as far
904000	907000	as you and Beth could figure out, was to copy the contents of Bill's computers.
907000	910000	It was very polite in his 20s.
910000	912000	Came with portable hard drives.
912000	915000	Someone at the house phoned the bank to make sure he was really supposed to be there.
915000	917000	The bank confirmed he was legit.
917000	920000	You brought him in to the office.
920000	924000	The guy logged onto the computers and you watched him copy the files of the portable hard drives.
924000	925000	I logged him on.
925000	928000	Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant.
928000	932000	The tech guy also took the papers that had been on the coffee table.
932000	937000	So this is the second person now that is like showing an urgent interest.
937000	938000	Wait, wait.
938000	940000	The papers are on the coffee table.
940000	942000	The DBTCI papers.
942000	945000	Did he take the papers?
945000	947000	You're my source of that.
947000	953000	I don't remember anymore because it would be severe to take the DBTCI papers.
953000	955000	It's almost like evidence.
955000	960000	Well, the police are gone at that point and that pretty clearly is the bank's property, right?
960000	962000	No, it's his property.
962000	963000	The papers are just him.
963000	965000	I don't think they took the DBTCI papers.
965000	969000	I think he just took the drives because I don't remember anyone taking those papers.
969000	970000	Okay.
970000	972000	I don't remember anyone taking them.
972000	973000	Okay.
973000	976000	Yeah.
976000	982000	In any case, this is now the second person is showing some like urgent interest in what's on your dad's computer.
982000	986000	You at that point figured it prudent to preserve all of the digital access to all the shit.
986000	988000	So you copied all down to the scrap paper.
988000	989000	Yeah.
989000	993000	I think if I said that I was wrong or maybe it was miscommunicated or something.
993000	994000	Okay.
994000	995000	That's fine.
995000	996000	It's not a big deal.
996000	997000	Okay.
997000	998000	I'll cut that.
998000	999000	Okay.
999000	1009000	So eventually like the media clears out and you are allowed to leave and you start telling your friends what happened
1009000	1013000	and your friends weren't even sure what to believe.
1013000	1018000	Like they thought maybe you were just really, really high or that you were exaggerating.
1018000	1024000	They couldn't believe the story you were telling.
1024000	1028000	And finally you make it back to your own apartment near a loan and lonely.
1028000	1031000	You can't get these horrible images out of your mind.
1031000	1038000	And eventually you turned on, you remember what music you turned on?
1038000	1043000	I had Johnny Cash and I had the Sinead O'Connor.
1043000	1045000	Yeah, that's the Sinead O'Connor.
1045000	1052000	Same song that your dad had been listening to when he was in bed.
1052000	1055000	Last day of our acquaintance.
1055000	1056000	Yeah.
1056000	1063000	The lyrics of this are in the book.
1063000	1067000	I've listened to that song quite a few times myself at this point.
1067000	1075000	It's certainly a meaningful song.
1075000	1076000	Okay.
1076000	1082000	Off to New York people go, Allah needs the wheelchair to get out of JFK.
1082000	1088000	She's had so many sedatives and that's like a rare moment of levity later in that week.
1088000	1094000	You and Alessa and Kushka joke that it's like not the first time you're on a wheelchair to get around an airport.
1094000	1096000	Well, yeah, something like that.
1096000	1101000	It was that she was a princess, sorry, jokes.
1101000	1104000	But not that she was so sedated all the time that she needed a wheelchair.
1104000	1105000	No, no, it wasn't that.
1105000	1106000	It was just a melodrama.
1106000	1108000	Yeah, melodrama.
1108000	1113000	You flew on February 4th, you arranged to fly in the same plane as your dad's coffin.
1113000	1116000	Someone needed to escort him on his final flight.
1116000	1120000	At Heathrow, a board of guard, looks at your passport and realizes you've been your visa's
1120000	1123000	long since expired and now you can come back.
1123000	1128000	It was actually more, because I got through passport control and then I thought I was clear
1128000	1135000	and then there was one more last sort of more casual passport control where there were two guys.
1135000	1139000	One guy had a podium on the right and he was a Sikh because he had the headdress
1139000	1145000	and then a white British guy on the left and you have to go through and they were just sort of eyeing you.
1145000	1149000	And then the Sikh had been looking for me the whole time because as soon as he spotted me,
1149000	1151000	he was very brash, you, here.
1151000	1153000	He knew exactly who I was.
1153000	1156000	So I guess the passport control informed these guys to stop me.
1156000	1158000	It was somewhere in between.
1158000	1163000	And then they pulled me aside and searched through my things and I gave them the doctor's note
1163000	1167000	with all the drugs because they were surprised with all the drugs I had.
1167000	1170000	And then they made me sign the paper.
1170000	1173000	They gave me a choice of one year or ten years.
1173000	1175000	You have all that, right?
1175000	1178000	And you have the paper.
1178000	1187000	The plane lands at JFK a little before 10 o'clock and a hurst drives on to the tarmac to collect the bottom.
1187000	1190000	Memorial service.
1190000	1195000	Everyone who comes in gets a little laminated card with a picture of Bill smiling on one side
1195000	1204000	and then Ruffle, Bill Emerson's poem about the meaning of successful life on the other side.
1204000	1209000	Bob tells a bunch of family stories.
1209000	1217000	Alessa reads a farewell letter that includes Peter and the wolf and how she would use to pick up his ties.
1217000	1225000	You read a free lunchroom scripture, which I've got here.
1225000	1231000	Michael Morandi and his eulogy notes how many hundreds of people are there.
1231000	1236000	He says that if he's looking down at this assembly, he'd wonder what all the fuss is about.
1236000	1242000	And then it's Alissa's turn and she reads, stop all the clocks.
1242000	1248000	She's just going to heartbreaking and she has trouble making it through because she's crying so much.
1248000	1256000	And then afterwards there's a memorial at the Park Avenue House in the kitchen of Bill.
1256000	1259000	I forgot to give you, I have to give you my speech.
1259000	1262000	You never did give that to me.
1262000	1270000	And there are a lot of guests in the apartment and one of them is Estelle, who is still her brother after all these years.
1270000	1276000	She approaches your mom and they hug and they both lost their men.
1276000	1281000	And all the whispers in her ear, they are together now.
1281000	1287000	Really? Does that make still sense?
1287000	1289000	Okay. You okay?
1289000	1292000	Yeah.
1292000	1299000	Okay.
1299000	1307000	So Bob Roach has a set of committee that's investigating the Renaissance text.
1307000	1309000	Does he jump to Bob Roach?
1309000	1311000	Not exactly.
1311000	1316000	Don't get excited.
1317000	1329000	And so they do this investigation and as part of that they find this phone call where,
1329000	1337000	well they find that Anshu has kind of assigned Bill back in 2008 the task of trying to make, to understand what these trades were about
1337000	1339000	and make sure everything was kosher.
1339000	1340000	Cool.
1340000	1347000	And he had basically said there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the way they were being handled
1347000	1351000	but he had this phone call with a colleague where he was very candid about the transaction's purpose.
1351000	1354000	And he says they were designed for tax reasons.
1354000	1359000	And the phone calls were recorded.
1359000	1360000	The phone calls were recorded?
1360000	1361000	Yeah.
1361000	1362000	Okay.
1362000	1365000	And the center investigators years later find that record them.
1365000	1371000	And it's very problematic for the bank because the bank's point was that they're not for tax purposes.
1371000	1378000	These were the legitimate business purposes and your dad has just been very candid and honest and open
1378000	1381000	and that is not in the bank's interest being candid and honest and open.
1381000	1390000	And so a bunch of people were being brought over to testify under oath to the Senate
1390000	1395000	and were making this argument that they didn't have anything to do with tax purposes
1395000	1399000	and here your dad was on tape openly declaring that that's exactly what they were.
1399000	1408000	And so it turns out that one afternoon in the late in the previous summer, so probably August or September of 2013,
1409000	1421000	some attorneys came from Paul Weiss to the big law firm to London to interview your dad about his role in the rest on the streets.
1421000	1422000	Right.
1422000	1432000	And it was kind of a routine interview and their goal was to figure out what your dad knew about the trades
1432000	1436000	that you guys take on all the documents and recordings that the investigators had obtained.
1436000	1445000	It's held around the corner from Deutsche's offices and they sat at like a very highly polished wooden table
1445000	1453000	and the lawyers told him that there's a chance he was going to have to go to Washington and be interviewed under oath on Capitol Hill.
1453000	1462000	And Bill, he was very polite and forthcoming and he struck the lawyers as terrified.
1462000	1464000	He had a hang dog look.
1464000	1469000	He seemed beaten down, world weary.
1469000	1472000	The meeting ends, the attorneys go back to...
1472000	1473000	Is this according to Bob Roach?
1473000	1474000	What was that?
1474000	1475000	This is according to Bob Roach.
1475000	1476000	No, this isn't Bob Roach.
1476000	1477000	This is...
1477000	1478000	Bob Roach isn't here.
1478000	1479000	Is this Paul Weiss?
1479000	1480000	The attorneys?
1480000	1481000	I'm not saying this is according to him.
1481000	1482000	This is the way it was perceived.
1482000	1483000	Okay.
1483000	1489000	The lawyers go back to Heathrow to catch their flight back to New York and they're waiting in the airport lounge.
1489000	1492000	And one of them is a phone call and it's Bill.
1492000	1496000	And he's got a million other questions about what he needs to do next.
1496000	1504000	The way this is described to me is that Bill seemed to be bracing for a world of shit to land on him at any moment.
1504000	1510000	He sounded terrified, he sounded slightly unhinged and the lawyers were very worried.
1511000	1512000	Unhinged?
1516000	1517000	Okay.
1525000	1526000	So...
1528000	1529000	Okay.
1529000	1531000	Unhinged, so it's...
1531000	1533000	Okay, I'm just curious.
1533000	1536000	So the lawyers describe him as unhinged on the phone?
1536000	1538000	Just out of worry?
1538000	1545000	They thought he seemed very scared, out of complete...
1545000	1547000	Completely disproportionate.
1547000	1548000	Right.
1548000	1550000	To what any of the real risks were.
1550000	1551000	Great.
1551000	1552000	Okay.
1553000	1554000	So...
1556000	1557000	You...
1558000	1564000	A few days after the memorial service, you decided that you needed help.
1565000	1569000	Taking too many drugs.
1569000	1573000	It's hard to get drugs in America, at least hard compared to London.
1573000	1576000	Well, the prescription. Hard to get the prescription.
1576000	1578000	Yeah, that's exactly what I've got.
1578000	1580000	Beth is gone.
1580000	1583000	So you sit down with your mom and your sisters and Uncle Bob.
1583000	1588000	And you discuss what you're gonna do.
1588000	1590000	You want to go to rehab.
1590000	1592000	You want the family to pay for it.
1592000	1597000	And Ola's less than enthusiastic about that.
1597000	1603000	And in part because she perceived you as having...
1603000	1612000	Her perception was that you were being ungrateful and entitled to not interested in suffering in some third-grade rehab facility.
1612000	1613000	This is her perception.
1613000	1614000	What?
1614000	1616000	No, they didn't want me to go at all.
1616000	1617000	No, I know.
1617000	1626000	I was about to say, she said that you should just hunker down for a few days at the university club and snap it on your own.
1626000	1630000	You knew from your experience that that was an unsupervised approach like that would not work.
1630000	1636000	You wrote your mom a letter on the university club's letter and say, I'm a grown man, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1636000	1639000	And eventually they agreed to send you to rehab in detox in Florida.
1639000	1642000	And so you go to sunrise detox.
1643000	1649000	You didn't take them up on the offer of comfort drugs and so you just went cold turkey.
1649000	1651000	And it was awful.
1651000	1653000	And you spend a lot of time in the shower crying.
1653000	1661000	When you weren't doing that, you were picking fights with the religious fundamentalists who were your fellow patients.
1661000	1664000	You didn't make friends.
1664000	1670000	So after 10 days there, you transferred to the Lucida Rehab Center.
1670000	1677000	Which turned out, despite its advertisements to the contrary, was basically like a construction site too large.
1677000	1678000	Yeah.
1678000	1681000	You were pissed off about the subpart conditions.
1681000	1684000	You convinced some of your fellow guests to leave.
1684000	1686000	Yeah, I was a total asshole.
1686000	1687000	What was that?
1687000	1689000	I was a total asshole.
1689000	1693000	One day you're about a weekend.
1693000	1695000	You're summoned to the boardroom.
1695000	1698000	You show up in a bathing suit to protest the lack of swimming pool.
1698000	1699000	Tonight.
1700000	1703000	The staff tells them you're kicked out.
1703000	1705000	You threw a bit of a tantrum.
1705000	1710000	The tantrum, not surprisingly, did not dissuade them of kicking you out.
1710000	1716000	Alessa took pity on her big brother.
1716000	1719000	You were in a bad situation and needed help.
1719000	1723000	So she found another rehab facility, Altamira.
1723000	1725000	And Altamira's nice.
1725000	1727000	And they're good chefs.
1727000	1731000	And you got a welcome basket with high-end toiletries.
1731000	1734000	And I've been here, I've been meaning to tennis with you.
1734000	1735000	That it was 50 grand a month?
1735000	1736000	Yeah.
1736000	1737000	That's amazing.
1737000	1738000	That's really expensive.
1738000	1740000	Yeah, I know.
1740000	1745000	Back in New York, family hired a consultant to advise them on how to deal with you.
1745000	1747000	I didn't want to be there at that point.
1747000	1749000	I remember I wanted to go home.
1749000	1751000	That's all I wanted to do was just go back.
1751000	1754000	I realized this whole thing was a terrible, terrible idea.
1754000	1755000	Why?
1755000	1756000	It was just a bad idea.
1756000	1757000	Why?
1757000	1760000	It was a bad time to go to rehab.
1760000	1762000	I need to be with my family.
1762000	1763000	I didn't want to do this.
1763000	1768000	Drugs were much more comforting than anything else at the time.
1768000	1771000	And I think I probably needed that to get through this.
1771000	1773000	And I should have been with my sisters and my mom.
1773000	1775000	I realized this terrible idea.
1775000	1777000	I kept saying, I don't want to go to rehab.
1777000	1778000	Let's go back to New York.
1778000	1779000	It's over.
1779000	1780000	It's done.
1780000	1781000	And then they said, no, no, no.
1781000	1782000	Stay here.
1782000	1783000	Stay here.
1783000	1785000	I want to go back to New York.
1785000	1787000	I was in a place that I lived.
1787000	1788000	Yeah.
1788000	1789000	Yeah.
1789000	1790000	And I used that 50,000 years ago.
1790000	1791000	50,000 a month.
1791000	1793000	That's 600,000 dollars a year.
1793000	1795000	It's like 50,000 a month.
1795000	1796000	Yeah.
1796000	1797000	It was ridiculous.
1797000	1799000	I said, this is ridiculous.
1799000	1804000	I just need to go back to New York, find a place to live and be with the family, and move on.
1804000	1806000	And spend the year in New York.
1806000	1808000	Because I had to do a year in New York.
1808000	1810000	Do a year in New York.
1810000	1812000	I'm banned from England for one year.
1812000	1815440	Stay away from the England and we had started looking at apartments
1815440	1817160	I don't know if you put that in there as well
1817160	1823240	My mom found a real estate person and had me go with her to look at apartments for rent around 93rd Street
1824480	1829640	We had been looking for places and then said well go to rehab first and come back. We'll find a place
1830240	1834960	And after I did the detox in the another ten days at Lucida
1835680	1841000	Or two weeks of Lucida the fill that was enough. I didn't want to go to Altamira. It was not my
1841720	1847680	Intention I was not throwing a fit like spend money on me to go to a fancy rehab. No, it was I want to go home
1847920	1849920	Spend no money on rehab. Let's just
1850880	1852560	Start again in New York
1852560	1856120	So I mean you could have surely if you didn't want to go there in the first place
1856120	1858120	You could have just not gotten on that plane to San Francisco
1858720	1862920	Yeah, I know I could not because they had a something called sober companion
1863200	1870400	That my sister and my mom and my uncle hired to fly out to Florida and accompany me to San Francisco
1870400	1873160	I didn't know that yeah, yeah sober companion
1873160	1878040	So there's a person that makes sure I didn't run away and didn't get drunk or get high or do anything like that
1878240	1882160	There's a whole another one of those sub businesses or
1884080	1888960	Associated with the rehab industry sober companions. So, yeah, they escorted me
1890240	1892240	Yeah, I thought I told you that
1893640	1895640	It's impossible you did
1896200	1900720	Yeah, no, that's them you can go verify that so it wasn't I didn't get on the plane
1901040	1906400	It was they wanted me to so badly. They hired this person to make sure I got from point A to point B
1907160	1909160	They did not want me coming back to New York
1911400	1916680	Okay, so I'm quoting from one of these letters that's important. No, I hear you
1916680	1923680	Yeah, I hear you and look at make a note of that. Well, I've got we've got notes recording in multiple different directions here, so
1924680	1926680	Um, sorry, Marie
1931360	1933680	Yeah, no, no, I haven't yet a great question
1935200	1939960	Yeah, yeah, but that's why there wasn't an option. It wasn't an option
1943560	1946800	Yeah, I thought I told you guys sometimes I
1947920	1951880	Think I yeah, maybe someone else I told but yeah
1952880	1960880	Okay, so the consultant says quote as you have seen the balance mindset in the past has enabled him to become dependent on not only drugs
1960880	1962880	But people and to thus not mature
1966280	1971080	That's a quote from the family consultant advising them on how to deal with you
1972680	1977480	This is around the time. Yeah, this is March of 2014
1978240	1983240	Is this the family is this the one that is a genetic freedom? Yes, this is the terrible genetic freedom. Yeah
1983760	1988400	Yeah, there's something wrong with this woman and my mom there. They had like mobbed up
1989240	1994960	And she was I never met this person and she was consulting my mom for a lot of money per month
1994960	2000600	And she had Freeman was not only a consultant for me to go to rehab. She was a therapist for my mom
2001320	2006560	So everything my mom said she filtered in and then actions were taken toward me
2007080	2010680	So I was she was part of my list of evildoers
2023440	2026880	Speed number six resuming
2027680	2029680	Okay
2032600	2034600	So
2035560	2041520	So in consultation with the consultant therapist
2043280	2049400	Your mom hasn't communicated to you via Altamira that if you're
2050880	2053040	If you manage to get a job outside of rehab
2053040	2058320	They might be willing to supplement your income, but they're not interested in funding some sort of itinerant lifestyle
2058320	2063520	And she instructed the staff at Altamira to inform you that if you left the facility
2064280	2065920	She would sever
2065920	2067920	She wouldn't she would stop the money
2069600	2071600	Well, she'd already stopped
2072800	2081280	So what point were we at in first month of Altamira? This is March 19th 2014. Yeah, so she'd already stopped money and
2082160	2086840	She was well, but at this point she's paying $50,000 a month free of rehab, right?
2086840	2092760	And if she says that if she if you leave rehab, right, she will not be paying you any money
2093000	2098240	Right, and yes, she has stopped paying you at that point, but she's essentially is paying right
2098240	2102600	It's not going to your pocket. It's going to Altamira's pocket, but they're feeding and yeah, right?
2102600	2105680	You know it would be important to make the difference, but yeah
2107440	2110800	So you were under the impression that you were just gonna spend a month there
2110920	2114080	But the end of a month the staff told you you can't go anywhere
2114640	2120160	You stayed put miserable you miss London you miss drugs you miss miss Beth you missed your father and
2121160	2125180	You found yourself my dad. Yeah, so that
2126000	2130880	Is that right? Yeah, and you found yourself something like I've snapped in you
2133080	2137040	Over the past couple of months and you found yourself thinking more and more about your time in foster care
2137040	2142080	And how you'd been deserted and how your mother resented you and you emailed Jenny. I think it was Jenny
2143720	2145720	Yeah, it was Jenny you emailed her
2146720	2152760	Around that time saying it's a shit year so far. It's weird. I cried and felt everything until I came here now
2152760	2154760	I'm numb and disconnected. Yeah
2155080	2158600	Later that spring all in Beth come out to San Francisco for family week
2160160	2161960	It's clear to Beth
2161960	2167720	That all expected Altamira to just solve your problems and release a clean rehabilitated grown-up
2168000	2169840	Which obviously is not the way these things work
2169840	2174960	Yeah, and you were to see them with anger toward your mother your sisters your doctors
2175280	2178560	Yeah, because I don't want to be this is now the third month. Yep
2178560	2181320	It's three months at each time. Let's stay one more month
2181320	2186720	I would give you back your all your stuff and then eventually it was just the kick-bath out of my apartment
2187360	2189360	Put all my shit in storage
2190080	2197300	Got rid of the apartment. I mean it was all back in London. This is back in the wild back in London. Yeah, and you and this
2197660	2204020	Yeah, no, I'm not yeah, I get it. I mean, I can't even really imagine but there's
2206500	2212860	This is when you have the blow-up at your mom in this group therapy session and all the pent-up rate comes out and
2213940	2218100	You say that when dad died your worst fears and the secret dreams came true at once
2219540	2221300	She wasn't
2221300	2223620	She wasn't in the right state of mind to make these
2224340	2228420	Big life-changing decisions that she was making and that's why you know
2230420	2232780	And that was the last time you saw that too, right? Yeah
2237340	2239340	All is start to know that sir
2240740	2244900	She was there too, but you left her out. Yeah, I don't have her in there
2245380	2247380	Um
2248980	2253220	All is kind of venturing I know not the last time I saw this again, right you saw her in New York. Yeah
2254020	2255460	Uh
2255460	2258260	But I'm just not getting into any of that. Yeah, so um
2260580	2262580	I am uh
2262740	2268100	Explained how all it kind of is starting bit by bit to come out of her shell going to art classes wearing dark glasses
2268660	2270660	things like that
2271220	2273060	Uh
2273060	2277780	Quoted from some of her emails where she every time like a new public scandal comes to light a Deutsche bank
2278020	2282660	And on one occasion she writes to someone my poor brilliant bill. What did they make them do?
2283620	2287140	Um, and she worried about money. She worried that she didn't fit in
2287780	2289780	The therapist told her to relax
2290020	2292020	um
2293620	2295460	Uh
2295460	2298980	She believed um that Deutsche
2300740	2302100	owed her
2302100	2307460	From bill free bills years of years of hard work. She toyed with a wrongful death lawsuit
2308180	2311460	Uh lured to be in researching those possibilities
2312420	2313940	um
2313940	2318100	This is by the time oh and she comes across and concurrently I felt the same
2319220	2321540	Um without talking to my mom
2322420	2329140	I was looking into that too throughout 2015. So all those lawyers 2014, right? This is 2014
2330100	2331860	uh all is
2331860	2337140	So they've researched this and ultimately there is going to be no wrongful death lawsuit and the bank agrees
2337860	2338820	to
2338820	2341220	pay out to her over a period of years
2342020	2343460	the
2343460	2349140	And it's several million dollars in payments that were due to bill but that had invested at the time of his death
2349940	2353540	Um, not the deferments. Yeah, these are deferments
2353540	2358020	So like his death would invalidate those deferments and they agreed to not invalidate them
2358420	2365060	And actually gradually pay them out and around that time is when a la gives up this idea of wrongful death lawsuit against the bank
2365780	2367780	um
2368340	2371060	So a la and the girls go to main to scatter the ashes
2371620	2372820	um
2372820	2375780	The you weren't invited and obviously were
2376660	2379060	Horribly hurt by that. Um, it's unbelievable
2380180	2381940	Yeah
2381940	2386180	But yeah, so going on this is now we're in spring 2014. Yeah
2386980	2388900	um at
2388900	2394580	The perception that you had was that your mom was trying to recast her life with you out of it
2395540	2402580	And that wasn't entirely unfounded and she was telling new acquaintances around that time that uh,
2402660	2406020	She had two daughters and when it eventually emerged that she had a son too
2406180	2409620	She would refuse to talk about him describing you as a forbidden subject
2411940	2413940	Um
2414900	2421300	You didn't understand why she was doing this and it you suspected that maybe it's because she was hiding something
2422340	2424340	and it, uh
2424660	2429220	I'm knowing it didn't occur to you that your actions might have
2430100	2436580	Also contributed to this. I guess you're in particular your explosion at ultimaria, which I thought that was disproportionate to everything else
2437700	2442580	Um, I mean I've exploited her before she's exploited me before this is nothing
2443220	2449060	Well, I think that was a particular explosion. It's okay. They're all particular. I'm not there. No, I'm not I'm not I'm not
2449220	2454340	Not a sign of blame. No, but I I started believing that it was more than just me. That's why I mean if it was just me
2454340	2458340	That's an obvious explanation if and I could deal with that. It's not like I was
2458900	2463540	Fooling myself, but when I look at the bigger picture that something else is happening and that's why I agree more suspicious
2463860	2468020	I'm not suggesting at all. That's why I actually plan to get into the emails because I had to find out more
2468020	2469620	Oh, it's funny you say that
2469620	2474260	It's funny you say that maybe the answers are at least clues. We're hiding in Bill's electronic file. There you go. Okay. So, uh,
2475140	2479300	We're we're in sync man. They're in sync. I've been listening carefully. Um,
2480420	2482420	and I'm noting here that
2483380	2486820	You the you've written down all these the codes as I in the passwords
2487380	2492980	And they had helped previously helped uncle bob get in for some online accounts and now in ultimaria
2493540	2499140	You started looking through the yahoo account and hunting for clues that might explain your mom's behavior
2499860	2501300	and it
2501300	2506340	so this is where we first learned about in the narrative here about, uh,
2507780	2510740	uh, Reverend Jack's death, which is a few years earlier
2511380	2512660	um
2512660	2518020	And hang out with that an effective bill. I don't know if you remember this email, but um,
2518900	2520660	yeah
2520660	2522420	sort of vaguely
2522420	2524340	He'd been
2524340	2528420	He'd really sunk into it. It hit him really really hard and
2529060	2535460	At one point after his so your grandfather after i'm told jack's more or Reverend Jack's memorial service
2536420	2540980	Bill emailed a friend or a friend even bill saying that he had looked dazed
2541700	2547140	At the memorial service and bill replied it was a much deeper below than I'd expected given his very long and well-lived life
2547860	2549860	um
2549860	2551700	and we know
2551700	2552820	that
2552820	2554820	he had been that
2554820	2556420	bills had been
2556420	2558740	You know turn into his mom his widow
2559460	2560820	for very
2560820	2561700	just
2561700	2563700	He was really really hit him hard
2564500	2566500	anyway, you um
2566900	2571220	You're crying now and the more you read the more you cry and you put on
2571700	2573700	anti-hiding the black crows
2574900	2577140	Think of the volume so that other people won't hear you crying
2578820	2580820	um
2581060	2585220	You leave ultimaria at the end early early july so you can spend their four months there
2585300	2588180	You go to silver living house strong in starry manor
2589220	2590180	um
2590180	2593700	This is where I would meet peggy. Yep. So you gotta put her in here
2594820	2598820	Well, no, you met her at all from here. Yeah. Yeah. So now we're in starry manor
2599380	2604180	Yeah, okay. Um, did you include peggy? So she no I haven't included because I just
2604580	2607300	We haven't figured out how we're doing that. Okay, um
2608340	2610340	But yeah, I agree that's where
2610580	2612580	Um
2613380	2615380	Um
2616420	2621540	So here I tell the brief story of spencer. Yeah, spencer Jesus. Um
2622660	2625860	Do you want to go through this or not really? I mean you know the story I know the story
2626980	2631860	I mean you and sophie and spencer sitting around spencer excuses himself goes to the bathroom
2632100	2634100	Doesn't come back you guys go look
2634260	2636260	Knock on the door. He doesn't answer
2636420	2640260	Turn open the door to one shut you kick it open. He's passed out the floor face blue
2640980	2642740	over us and
2642740	2647540	You cradle him while he while you wait for the paramax to arrive and you're sitting there
2648020	2651060	Clear as past. Yeah, so he doesn't show up in his vomit and
2651780	2656580	Wondering if this is going to be the second time any in the year that you've seen in the room of the dead man
2657940	2662180	I'm obviously noting that he survived, but then a year later didn't
2662820	2664820	um
2665780	2667780	Um
2669700	2676020	So what continues to drive you crazy at this point is you don't understand why your dad did this it's uh
2679060	2680660	And his death
2680660	2685940	Even though he says in his note. He like suicide note to you. He apologizes for his coldness to you at times
2686820	2688180	he
2688180	2690740	He also he was like a stabilizing presence in the family
2690900	2693620	He defended you when all of us seemed ready to give up
2694420	2696020	and now
2696020	2701540	You're not coincidentally you're already the black sheep and now you're really a black sheep in the family
2702500	2704500	Why is where you meet Sophia?
2705460	2707460	Um Sophie
2708660	2710660	Sophie yeah, that's good. Thank you

2725140	2730420	She doesn't run away. She said don't talk to me like that. I get it. You're in pain. You flash out. I'm not gonna run away from you
2731220	2732260	and
2732260	2733140	uh
2733140	2734340	You guys
2734340	2736740	Bond and she tries to convince you
2737620	2742340	That your family doesn't hate you if they did hate you. Why would they be putting up in these nice facilities?
2742900	2746180	She knows from her personal experience that they're in my worst facilities to be in
2747060	2749380	If our families didn't give a shit about us, they wouldn't put us here
2750340	2752500	um
2752500	2756100	You keep telling her I'm sure we're that simple, but it's really not
2756900	2759620	But she has a very simplistic way of looking at these things
2760980	2762980	She's a good person
2764900	2766900	Um, sorry
2767220	2771620	So so you keep saying over and over again you want to figure out why
2772580	2776660	Your dad did this and that there's no way he just like offed himself one day
2777540	2780180	And so if he tries to warn you off and says no one will ever know
2780820	2784660	Ask them the question over and over again. You're just torturing yourself and even if you do figure out the answer
2784820	2786820	What do you do with that information?
2788340	2790340	You keep looking
2790500	2792500	um
2792580	2796900	It started if they have realized what's in these email accounts and there's all this
2797140	2801940	You know personal information about like all the logistic family logistics and meeting up with friends
2802580	2805060	There's a copious quantities of spam
2805860	2806900	um
2806900	2808580	Which made you
2808580	2814100	Kind of laughed yourself that maybe you'd like put his email in to get some to get access to a phone website at some point
2814980	2819540	And then there's all this don't you back stuff and uh, this is where you started to vote in
2820180	2822180	Let's do your time and energy
2822180	2824180	Especially given that you knew
2824180	2830420	That one of the suicide notes had been to on shoe and so that clearly suggests that doge event was at least on his mind at the time of his death
2830500	2835220	Yeah, and so you start scavenging and it
2836340	2840420	You know, there are little things that you can make sense of there's clear that uh
2841380	2845620	You can tell from some of this dbtca emails that your dad is angry at times and like
2846580	2851220	Especially about the stress tests, but most of this is just golly good. You can't you don't understand
2852260	2854740	What it means and so this is where I enter the story
2855380	2857380	um
2858020	2861860	And I tell the story quickly you answer before this you answer in february
2861940	2869300	Well, I this it says five months early earlier. I contacted the bell, right? Uh, so there I tell that story and I mention
2870580	2877700	That just kind of our online flirtations basically over four or five months again provide me shit right and had just like
2878420	2879300	been
2879300	2881300	really annoying
2881700	2883620	You were equally annoying
2883620	2889620	The constant calls and emails. Yeah, we're gonna go in two days. Well, you know, if we don't hear from you
2889620	2894100	I'm just gonna write whatever I want. I don't think I said quite that but there is paraphrasing
2894340	2898340	You at one point. I don't know if you remember this sent a picture of a picture to me
2898580	2905460	Yeah, like an Ivan picture of a fire in downtown San Francisco. Yeah, and uh, this is a very cryptic you
2906420	2908020	We knew exactly where you were
2908020	2914020	Yeah, because we could see in the photos property. So we we located you on the back patio of ultimera. Oh, you did?
2914740	2916740	I didn't know that. That's funny
2916980	2918980	Um, oh no. Yeah, you didn't tell me that
2921140	2928100	Did you do geolocation you you write really was it the tags in the front in the photo? Yeah, okay. I didn't strip the tags
2928900	2930900	Yeah, that was sloppy. Yeah
2931380	2935220	Not good not good spike right there. Really terrible spike craft. Yeah. I was just learning
2936180	2937860	So anyway in july
2937860	2942100	I was just starting out Tuesday evening mid july it's two weeks after you arrived at starboard man
2942100	2945140	Are you sending me an email and said are you still looking into deutcha?
2945780	2947380	And I said yes
2947380	2952900	And you kind of explain the situation and asked for some keywords jenny strassberg and I sent a bunch of keywords
2953860	2959140	Um, which I've got to say looking back on them now are pretty good keywords. Yeah, never good subpoena
2959620	2961140	DOJ
2961140	2967060	FRBNY that's good federal which we're bringing here good way to start live or christian bittar mori napaski
2967940	2971300	often good good good job journalists
2972980	2977620	Yeah, a lot of the troidex in a lot of them I repeat you still send them some of those keywords
2978420	2980420	Absolutely. Yeah, I
2981860	2985780	With the with the emissions trading stuff you sent the some similar keywords
2985860	2987060	uh
2987060	2990020	So you start sending stuff over most of it was useless
2990420	2993860	Kind of interesting but like not very useful and then at 1 33 in the morning
2994740	2998500	On july 18th. You sent the mother load
2998900	3001380	Uh, or another mother load, but the jackpot one
3002180	3007700	I professed it by saying don't know what this means, but and it was the letter that's a mere fed
3007780	3012020	But does you include my strategy of trying to get you fired? No, I did not
3012740	3017540	That's a that was that was later anyway. No, that was during the time
3018500	3022980	It was well, it's a little bit later, but it was right around the time of publishing the fed letter
3023620	3028500	That I realized. Okay. This is the plan. This is my revenge to your wall street journal. Yeah, I'm not
3028580	3035540	I could use you for this so ridiculous. It's not ridiculous as charles was I explained the whole plan of charles
3036100	3038100	I told you that you could verify with charles
3038820	3043620	You explain the whole thing and so did sydney sydney can also verify and peggy, of course could but she can't now
3044500	3046740	Not a good plan. It was a great plan
3047380	3051540	It was because there was no purpose to the plan. The purpose was to get you fired. Right. No, I get that
3052340	3056740	This discredited the wall street journal, right, but to what end just for my own
3057220	3063620	Just because you want to destroy something I felt like destroying something right, but we had not actually done anything to deserve destruction
3063860	3065860	No, but I felt in my
3066020	3071300	It was very angry at the time and I felt I didn't have an outlet for the anger. So I picked wall street journal
3071860	3074500	Well, it didn't work. No, I didn't go through with it
3075060	3080900	Because of the sony hack but had the sony hack not happened. I would have gone through with it. I really would have so okay
3081620	3086020	It's important. I think that's a good part of the story because it shows the anger, you know
3086660	3090900	I had no direction for it and although it was misguided. I just put it upon you guys
3090980	3092980	And that's kind of how the relationship
3092980	3095620	We we continued relationship and a lot of it was out of anger
3096020	3099780	And you were useful to me at the time as well and obviously I was useful to you
3100180	3105460	But I also had an ulterior motive and that was to destroy your credibility and the wall street journal's credibility
3105540	3109060	But I don't understand but you never you only gave you useful stuff
3109700	3114420	I know because the plan was to give you useful stuff until you stopped fact checking everything I gave you
3115380	3117380	That was a serious problem
3117540	3121540	No, but no but at some point if I just keep you giving you great stuff and you
3122260	3124740	You just okay. This is from val obviously. It's good
3125220	3130340	You know at some point and when that when that thresholds crossed then they changed a few numbers here and there
3131060	3134900	And then you publish something and then the stock market reacts
3135300	3141140	And I write a letter to the editor and I say excuse me, but it looks like I went over this
3141940	3146740	Spreadsheet and it looks like these numbers have changed since the moment I gave it to david and the moment it was published
3146900	3151540	In in the wall street journal and then I just leave it alone and let the rest of the world react
3151700	3155700	That was a plan. I told charles with this plan in the car when he came to visit me
3155700	3159860	I know I know you I know you did told peggie. I told this is not a not a good plan
3160180	3162180	I may rather than it's good or bad
3162820	3165220	It speaks to your state of mind. It doesn't matter. It's a state of mind
3165380	3169700	And it's also interesting because that was my relationship to you at that time not only
3170340	3175940	Was you helping me and I was helping you but this was my got my purpose. I hear you. Okay, so
3177140	3180420	You I think you should include this. I really think I hear you
3180980	3184260	I don't know why you're just reticent to include that because
3186340	3188340	It's kind of funny in a way
3188340	3194100	Looking back is funny. I mean not not so funny to me, honestly, but like
3194660	3198340	Okay, maybe not to you that's uh state of mind. I was in
3198980	3203300	Yeah, that's I mean, I think it's pretty clear at this point that you're not in a great state of mind
3204100	3206100	Uh, so
3206420	3209220	Um, anyway, we do the story
3210260	3214580	Uh stock can save it for the the director's cut and you get scenes
3217060	3222500	Uh, we do the story doge bank stock gets whacked pretty hard and you have a feeling of
3223220	3225860	Efficacy. Yeah, you did something. I made a difference
3227140	3229140	Um
3229380	3231060	Had value
3231060	3234900	Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. Exactly. What do you had had value and it?
3235620	3237380	um
3237380	3239380	Okay, so
3239540	3242660	Charlie Gimbino kills himself uh that fall
3243380	3246820	So that's now two doge bank people. Did you get a hold of them at all?
3247700	3249700	I'm not gonna get into that right now. Um
3250740	3252020	Yes
3252020	3256100	No, that's not necessarily yes, uh close. There's uh
3256660	3257860	Uh
3257860	3262020	So Gimbino's death to you at the time was like
3262980	3267940	It was just like fuel for you because it it like really invigorated you not like in a way
3269220	3274900	It got you it was like it gave you the energy to push forward and like really investigate the reasons for your dad's death even more
3275700	3279460	And completing that became kind of an addiction for you. Um
3281780	3283940	Uh, you thought this was a soluble problem
3283940	3287300	You told me think of suicide as the most rational act a human can make
3287700	3290100	Then work backwards from that. Sure. It's an emotional act
3290100	3293460	Which is why many people get lost and explain it away as crazy or unknowable
3293700	3295700	But if you look at the reasoning it makes sense
3296100	3299300	Unfortunately, my father didn't leave a reason but he left clues
3299940	3303300	And so those clues are you're convinced are buried
3303860	3308260	In these emails and you still don't really know fine entity this itunes u-class
3309140	3311140	um
3311220	3312900	Which i've watched by the way
3312980	3315300	Thanks, you've watched yeah, yeah, um it's pretty good
3317220	3318820	Um
3318820	3325380	But still all of this is like pretty murky. You don't really understand this and this is when north koreans
3326180	3330180	Come into the picture. They hack sony that murky. I mean give me a better understanding
3331540	3338180	What do you mean like the equilibrium theory parts? I mean live it was no no no no no no my point is it puts you in the headspace of finance
3338180	3342420	Yeah, it does totally totally it doesn't help with the acronyms and the right exact. That's my point
3342420	3344420	Yeah, okay, um
3344820	3347460	And you weren't doing the homework right when I was doing the homework
3348020	3351380	Well, I mean not the homework for the class but my version of homework
3351780	3355620	Was just you were just getting this theory and looking forward in the emails. Yeah, um
3357140	3359140	Okay, sony hack
3359460	3366420	You see a screenshot on a news story of those links that are in the the thing. You don't talk about
3368900	3371460	You find the email addresses in the zip file
3372500	3373540	um
3373540	3375060	You wonder
3375060	3379140	Maybe if sony systems are so vulnerable or dutch's too. Yeah, uh
3379940	3381460	Sitting outside
3381460	3384580	The starboard manor house on a picnic table or picnic bench
3385140	3388180	And you know, it's like I've said like why would someone waste their time with sony when you could
3388740	3392980	Hack a fucking bank. He's made this a lot quote. I'm interested in joining your gop
3393060	3397140	But I'm afraid my computer skills are self-mortar good best if I can help in any other facility. Please let me know
3398180	3400180	and it uh
3400580	3402580	The hackers add either the email list
3402820	3404020	and
3404020	3408980	A few days passed and you get a link to all these files. You start downloading them
3410020	3411700	I said I could help
3411700	3413460	You said
3413460	3415940	I'm interested in joining your gop
3416020	3420740	But I'm afraid my computer skills are self-mortar good best in joining your gop. I'm interesting
3421300	3426500	It's a typo interested. Yeah, you meant interested. I'm interested in joining your gop. You're joining in
3427220	3433540	In space joining join the word join. Yes, I'm interested in joining your gop
3433780	3438900	But I'm afraid my soft my computer skills are self-mortar good best if I can help in any other facility. Please let me know
3438900	3440900	Wait, that's a severe
3442100	3445940	Mistake joining the word joining. I wasn't trying to join the gop
3447140	3453060	I was interested and something else. Let me autocorrect into joining. There's no way I said I want to join your
3453300	3458500	Let's we let's that's that's interesting. You want to look in your files right now? Yeah, I gotta look at that
3458660	3460660	Well, no, I believe it's there. I just uh
3461220	3463220	I just think if I wrote that
3463700	3468180	I'm interested in enjoying what you're doing is what I remember. That's my instinct
3468900	3473140	No, I mean it's no. I'm interested in joining your gop
3473300	3477700	But I'm afraid my computer skills are soft mark at best if I can help in any other facility
3477780	3481060	Please let me know. I guess I did say that because why would I say my computer skills?
3481060	3483060	Yeah, I just want to get some water
3483300	3485780	Yeah, um, yeah, I guess I did say that
3486900	3488900	um
3489380	3493620	Anyway, you get the while these files are all downloading. This is a few days later now
3494580	3496580	you, uh
3497700	3499700	You suggest
3502660	3504660	I don't know
3504660	3506660	I mean, I don't think so
3507460	3509460	I don't I have no idea
3510420	3512420	Um
3513060	3515060	Um, I mean
3515620	3518820	And then a few days later when these files are all downloading you email them again
3519140	3522020	And you say hey, you guys ever thought about going after Deutsche bank
3522580	3525060	There's tons of evidence on their servers of worldwide fraud
3525060	3529300	Some of them had even contributed to the very sad and tragic suicides of two of their employees. Yes
3529620	3534180	Uh, I knew immediately was maybe that wasn't the best thing I've done at the time
3534260	3537940	But anyway, that's the end of that and then you go through all these files and you're like
3538580	3540580	Posting crazy shit and
3541540	3542740	You
3542740	3545380	aren't really famous, but then you get the letter
3546100	3547060	from
3547060	3549060	Twitter and from sony
3549060	3554580	and then you uh threatening you and you share them with me and uh
3556180	3559620	We wrote a story about this random musician. No one had ever heard of
3561060	3564580	Facing down david boys and sony and twitter
3565460	3567220	and uh
3567300	3574340	And I'm quoting a bit from the fox business exclusive interview, uh, which is wonderful. Um
3576020	3580020	And it and look this is a moment for you because you realize
3580980	3582980	That and this is two things have happened
3582980	3587380	One was your interactions with me about the deutch bank fed letter and then the sony heck and you realize
3587540	3592340	Like there's this ravenous appetite for primary source documents. We can cite big companies
3593220	3595860	feels good to have valuable information and
3596740	3601140	And you know what you have more information. Yeah, and charles levin's now enters the picture
3602420	3609060	With uh emailing you with some kind of inflammatory theories to get you interested and and uh
3612660	3616340	You know he finds it very quickly finds excuse to come out to camp california to see you
3617060	3621540	And I go through that rhythm of role. He says, um
3622420	3624420	Um
3627460	3632900	And you wanted to at this point kind of remake your dad's or help your dad's legacy because um
3634020	3636020	At this point
3636180	3638180	Was your journal article
3638740	3642980	So misguided it's not it because not my corner at the time
3643540	3648420	What in reality what had happened is that the coroner in london had done this inquest
3648820	3651620	And the public hearing read a lot of very small snippet of
3652180	3658340	The letter from a psychologist that said bill was very anxious about unspecified government investigations
3658900	3662980	And that had led to a handful of news stories, including the washington journal. I know
3663940	3667780	You can imagine from my point of view though. I mean just from a non-journalist point of view
3667780	3673060	You see the headline brooksman hangs himself over. I guess I just never really understood. I still understand. Anxiety into lever probe
3673380	3675380	Libor, sorry, lever probe. Um
3675940	3679940	It just it shows like oh, he was guilty somehow. It shows culpability
3680740	3686180	I know I get why you don't like it. But yeah, like everyone wrote the same story. I know but you guys broke it
3687060	3690340	No, we didn't he didn't you broke the story. It's your journal
3691460	3694760	Uh, you broke that you broke that story in february 2014
3695780	3699300	I'm telling you. I like remember that very well and we did not break it
3700180	3706260	It was announced at the coroner's office. Anyway, it doesn't matter. No, but the title that that title was your title
3707620	3709380	um
3709380	3711380	So leavenson comes back to california
3711860	3713140	um
3713140	3716180	I mean, we don't need to litigate this. No, I'm not just telling you from my point of view
3717220	3722340	How I thought at the time is extremely clear that you want to destroy it. Okay. Um
3723460	3727940	You gave uh leaven you as much as it was the institution. I had yourself
3728580	3734340	Um, I was the vehicle of destruction. I was like the the bomb that was yes
3735860	3737860	um
3738100	3740100	The unknown saboteur
3740500	3744100	And you were the saboteur. Well, you would be done. Yes the vehicle
3744820	3747300	anyway, okay, so uh
3748180	3754660	You share but or you let leavenson poke around in the computer files. Yeah, uh, he finds the stress test stuff
3755540	3760420	And he returns to new york and a few months later does the story about the stress tennis
3760580	3762580	But remember we had a deal
3762660	3767700	I didn't just give him this stuff. I we had a deal. He thought yeah, I actually mentioned so you thought
3768500	3774340	He was gonna do a big big feature on your day. I thought he gave his word that he would do that a few times
3775060	3777060	um
3777780	3779780	Okay
3780580	3782580	um
3785060	3787060	Uh
3797780	3799780	Okay, let's see
3802340	3804340	Um
3804580	3806740	We have a bunch of stuff that's not of any
3808020	3814500	Rowan's to your dad. Okay. Was that Deutsche bank? Yeah, it's just lots and lots of stuff wants to go down to the bank
3814820	3816820	um
3817700	3820260	Uh, and now we're getting a lot of trump stuff
3822660	3825300	Okay, okay, then we fast forward
3826340	3828660	To the bellomar hotel. Okay
3829860	3831860	And you're sitting on the back steps
3831940	3836740	Your laptop's going crazy. So so we're in so hard. It's actually hot to the touch
3837780	3839780	um
3840900	3842900	June 2015
3843300	3847860	Six months earlier, you left strawberry manor. So six months earlier being around the start of the year
3848740	3851060	Uh, you left strawberry manor migrated south to LA
3851620	3855860	Taking the good ranch and I now know that Peggy did that. Uh, that's not in here because
3856580	3858580	That was our group, right? Um
3859220	3866180	This is when you're introduced to larry melzer. Mm-hmm. Good old larry. Good old larry. I love larry. He's a great guy
3866420	3869860	I love larry too. Um, I am a solution focused therapist
3870100	3876260	Towards his motto and he calls the patients clients. Um, you told your story to him
3878500	3880500	um
3880580	3887060	And we're kind of this is kind of evolving into flashbacks. This is all getting mixed up in our lives here, but um
3892420	3896020	Can you bring the whiskey over here? Sorry, can you grab the whiskey too?
3896020	3898020	Okay
3898180	3900180	Stay out of our shot
3900980	3902980	What?
3902980	3904980	Um, no, I'm okay
3907620	3909620	Um, okay
3910260	3912260	So
3913860	3918820	You tell larry that you're on a mission to figure out why your dad killed himself and
3920100	3921780	See
3921780	3923780	He said that back is that better
3924180	3928580	I think it was good actually the way it was. I thought I think it was more. Was it too much? No, no
3931620	3935380	So you told larry that you're on a mission to figure out why your dad killed himself
3935460	3940020	But you're being kind of thwarted by your inability to communicate with or get information from your mom
3940180	3943700	Yeah, um, not least the suicide notes and it
3944740	3947220	Then I kind of rewind a little bit and explain
3948020	3952100	Why it is a you're unable this point to communicate with her. Okay. Um
3952500	3954500	And
3954900	3961220	You had just like gotten to a point where you both of you could like not control your rage at the other one and
3961940	3964980	And I quote a bunch of emails going back and forth between the two of you
3965700	3971060	About you. I mean, frankly like hurling a bit of verbal abuse in her direction and her just being like
3971860	3973860	I see as I see can be
3974660	3976660	back in response and
3978260	3980580	Uh, I mean one in one particularly
3981140	3982580	poignant
3982580	3986340	Moment she says I love you and have been paying for you for 30 years
3987060	3989940	Which struck me as I thought about more as just
3990660	3994980	Really remarkable because when she wrote that it was exactly 30 years
3995060	3998420	And she had rescued you from foster care that she had let you go into
3999140	4000580	and
4000580	4007140	And now she's framing that decision 30 years later as I have been paying for you for 30 years. Well, that's what mothers
4007380	4013620	That's what parents do. You like it's exactly 30 years. It was exactly 30 years. Yep. I think she was aware of that
4014180	4017940	I mean, she's the one who said for 30 years and it was exactly 30 years
4018500	4020500	Uh, and she was framing that decision now
4021380	4024180	Fixing what she had previously told bill was her grave mistake
4024980	4028820	Uh as having imposed a financial burden on herself
4029540	4031540	um
4032020	4034020	Uh
4034740	4037540	She when you ask for a personal credit card
4038100	4040820	And accuse her of stealing the money that you were supposed to inherit
4041540	4048340	She yells at you dad left you zero. I am the one who loves you. No more complications about any financial matters. You're on your own
4049060	4051060	Uh
4051780	4056980	She perceives irresponsibility and laziness on your part. You perceive iciness and deceit on her part
4057620	4060740	You guys like cannot interact at this point and you tell larry
4061460	4067220	That you need someone to intermediate for you and larry cheerfully replies that that's what I do. That's my job
4068020	4070020	and uh
4070580	4075540	So he gets on the phone top priorities to get some money from her because you've had that one been kicked out of indigo ranch
4076340	4077140	um
4077140	4078420	because you
4078420	4080420	you were accused of verbally abusing
4080980	4084900	a staff member who had unplugged your recording equipment mid-session and
4086420	4088420	um
4089220	4092740	He so so he goes and tries to get money so you can
4093620	4097140	For it somewhere nice or not nice, but somewhere decent to stay so you're not the road way in
4097780	4102180	And all his responses. Why won't he get a job and melts her eventually wears him down
4102900	4105700	Get you back on a monthly allowance of $2,500
4106980	4107620	um
4107620	4108740	Well
4108740	4111140	Started out a lot less more like $1,500
4111860	4112820	Yeah
4112820	4114020	I'm saying eventually
4114020	4121220	But it had been $300 which was obviously not a viable way to live anywhere. Certainly not in a major city
4121860	4122820	um
4122820	4124980	So you get you move in to
4125940	4129540	I mentioned you were at the roadway and you were hooking up with meg and the drug dealer
4130100	4132100	And then you then upgrade to the bellomar
4133620	4134740	um
4134740	4136740	melts her encourages you
4136900	4138180	to
4138180	4141620	Do what you can to figure out what what your arms got
4142340	4144340	And he also shares with you
4145540	4152020	His theory about what's going on with a la which is he's gleaned apparently from his few conversations with her and what you've told him
4152660	4156740	And it's that she continues to hold a grudge against her first husband
4157940	4159300	um
4159300	4164820	Uh, she's consumed with anger at alexander and shame with herself because she failed as a mother
4165540	4167540	Now she's taking out these emotions on you
4168260	4171220	Uh locking you out of the family in order to safeguard her dignity
4171780	4174420	Quote it's about her own social standing her own reputation
4175140	4176900	This is according to melts her
4176900	4177700	um
4177700	4180260	This obviously reinforces your impression to what's going on
4181060	4184660	and all these painful memories going all the way back to foster care and
4185380	4187460	uh
4187460	4189460	and
4189940	4194660	Let's see. I mean it's also kind of from my perspective a bit of a simplistic theory like it doesn't account for
4195380	4201380	All the other like the the fight at this point was two-sided right like you're you were being really rough on her and
4202260	4204260	And she would be listening living in a car
4205300	4209220	Yeah, and she was flying private jets. So yeah, it was a little upset
4212100	4215380	Volved in there to various not quite to that
4216420	4221140	Yeah, dude, I I get like you're both hurt. Yes like from like
4221860	4223860	And she must be feeling really guilty
4224340	4227460	Just a bit for all this stuff built up over decades
4228260	4230260	anyway, um
4231060	4234900	Uh, you had over time been asking ala to share with you
4235700	4239300	The suicide notes she refused you assumed she was hiding something and there was
4240020	4243860	You your guess was that it's something to do with what he had written what bill had written to amshu
4244260	4246260	Which is presumably about doi chi bank
4246420	4251540	And one of your theories is that doi chi was paying all of it if you quiet about the true reasons for the suicide
4252340	4255700	And I saw was one of your it's your theory. Well
4258900	4260900	No, that's not that's really not my theory
4261860	4265780	Is something that doi chi was paying her off. I didn't think that at first I thought
4266820	4270660	It's possible that leavenson planted that in your head a little bit because there's
4271540	4274420	I have seen that in some of the email traffic. You've also told that to me
4275220	4277220	Like in real time
4277220	4279220	I always thought that was your theory
4279700	4281700	Don't blame me for this. No, I'm not it's not blame
4282900	4285940	It's definitely not my theory. Uh, I mean, I have no idea
4286420	4289780	But I do know meld surgery that that that you might be onto something there
4292740	4293940	So
4293940	4297540	You type in so you tried guessing her gmail password that didn't work
4298100	4301780	And so you typed into google a question. How do you hack a gmail account?
4302660	4307940	And I've done that search and it sure enough brings back tens of millions of hits very quickly
4308660	4311700	Uh, and so you I walked through how you
4312420	4319060	Like learned how to do this and I then then we reached back to where we'd just begun which is that you're sitting on the steps outside the bellom are
4319860	4329060	Uh, creating a fake wi-fi spot hot the wi-fi hotspot and watching all the bellomars guests log on and you can see passwords and credit cards and things like that
4329300	4331300	It's a little scary
4331620	4333540	um
4333540	4334740	So
4334740	4340500	It's time to try this and you get meld surgery to negotiate stala for 20 grand for a car
4341300	4346900	Use snort some heroin go to use car lot and plunk down 20 grand on a silver outie q5 fully loaded
4348500	4350500	Quattro
4352980	4356660	Okay, so on father's day you start heading east
4357620	4363700	Um, you try to make some money in vegas that does not work so well. That's not what happens to your heroin
4364340	4368740	I run out and I somebody gets dumped on the shag carpet in the hard rock hotel
4372900	4374900	So before going to new york
4374980	4381140	You arrange for the reunion with the bandmates in philadelphia. You're supposed to meet goldsboro and pittsburgh
4381940	4383940	um, uh
4384500	4390580	You drive for 36 hours straight. Yeah approaching pittsburgh. It's gotta be a new record, too
4391540	4394660	36 hours from vegas to first pretty good. What are you doing?
4395620	4396980	i'm not listening
4396980	4399940	Come come back. I'm coming. Can you listen to this?
4403380	4408180	Yeah, so go on. I'm listening. No, I want I want you here for when I'm explaining this because this is
4408820	4411620	A story that you can tell better than I can
4412100	4415780	Okay, oh, so you want me to no, I want you to tell I just want you to be here to help me out. Okay
4418820	4423380	But in the meantime, uh, you're killing me man. You're killing me. You're like
4424100	4426100	What am I doing?
4427140	4429140	No, I'm just trying to understand. I'm just right here
4429940	4432180	Checking the frame. Come on, man. Tucked up
4434180	4437300	You stole that line for me. Now he says chopped up all the time
4438260	4442820	I've been saying chop chop for years. I'm actually not sure we're supposed to say chop chop
4443700	4445700	What's that?
4446020	4452740	No chop chop is I kept telling you chop chop david. Come on. Where's the article chop chop? So, okay, it's uh three a.m
4453380	4459540	Okay, you're approaching pittsburgh gas station. You realize are did you leave out strawsburgh coming out to yeah?
4459540	4465700	I just don't get into that. It's like too complicated. I skip uh hoover dam as well. Okay, um
4465940	4467060	I'm
4467060	4469060	pittsburgh
4469220	4471220	Um gas station
4472100	4474900	Why did you think the other motorists were plotting to murder you?
4476100	4478100	um
4479140	4481140	That was delusional
4481220	4485460	And obviously, you know very high I hadn't slept for a very long time
4486660	4492020	So there was a time I outran it wasn't they were trying to I'd outrun a police officer
4492900	4499300	Somewhere outside of in the border of uh, it's west virginia in pennsylvania. Was that the right?
4500740	4506740	Anyway, whatever borders pennsylvania and that's where I entered and I had thought that the
4507700	4513140	Uh, the police officers had called ahead to search for this for because I crossed the state lines
4513140	4516820	So they couldn't do anything in that one state so they had to call their friends the other state
4517300	4520820	And since it's like one town next to each other, it's not a jurisdiction. I'm sure
4521540	4523540	That stopped the police officers from
4523620	4526740	Uh, Tennessee or the fuck I was going to pennsylvania
4526740	4531780	So I thought they called their friends and the precinct ahead of me to look for my car and catch me
4532500	4533860	If they could
4533860	4538900	so um, and as the delusions were this is getting more and more severe, I thought that uh
4539700	4542420	I was being followed by off-duty police officers
4542500	4547300	And they're just waiting to catch me to pull me over if you're doing something because they couldn't pull me over for outrunning a cop
4547300	4549940	On some other state line because I cop had no jurisdiction
4550180	4554900	But if they caught me speeding or doing anything else, they had all the right to pull me over and then
4555540	4559700	Arrest me. So I was trying very carefully to follow all the rules and be very safe
4560420	4563780	And I had uh, wait, but then you arrive at the gas station. What happens?
4564660	4569140	Wait, but this is before the gas station, right? But then you get to the gas station because I love the gas station
4569380	4574980	Yeah, I needed to get gas. Um, and so I told you about where before they got I pulled off to the gas station
4575700	4576740	and
4576900	4578100	um
4578100	4580100	There was it was in the first one was empty
4580580	4583380	There was no it was closed and so
4584020	4590580	I tried to get back onto the ramp onto the highway and these cars came out of nowhere and got in front of me onto the
4591380	4593860	Onto the ramp and it put on its brake lights
4594340	4597780	And it was a truck and it had a sign on the backs of caution
4598500	4605060	And it was just a normal caution sign that a truck would have but I read that as the truck was telling me to be careful
4605860	4610340	And I was like like the driver of the truck was like you have to be careful because we're gonna we're gonna get you
4610660	4612340	I was like, oh no
4612340	4614740	so I managed to get back on the highway and find a
4615700	4617700	Well at gas station
4617700	4623540	And then when I got to the gas station, we really took over it was so I got so crazy. It's so scary
4624900	4627540	I was really scared for my life. I thought these people were gonna
4628020	4632420	Are gonna beat the shit out of me because like redneck fill in the middle of nowhere and
4633140	4638180	Like they were conspiring and to murder me for outrunning one of their friends
4638260	4643860	Or it was just this got built up in my head and I couldn't you know, I thought I someone had slipped me up acid
4644340	4647140	I I remember going to the gap to the mcdonald's for coffee
4647700	4651140	And I'm thinking is there lsd in this coffee like what the fuck this can't be normal
4651700	4657860	And at some point I lost the fact that this was either me or lsd or something else that had drifted off
4658420	4659540	into
4659540	4660660	into
4660740	4666100	Memory and what took over and my consciousness was that I was in this terribly dangerous situation
4666900	4669540	And um, and how are we gonna get people's attention to help you?
4669700	4672580	I was gonna get people's attention by the same the car and fire
4673380	4678020	Is my recollection of what you told me is that you were going to ram the car into the gas pumps?
4678340	4683860	No, but no, I was gonna no, I was gonna set the car and fire reporting gas all over the car
4684260	4686260	So the way goldsboro
4686980	4689860	Tells this to me is that he's on the gray hand in the middle of the night
4690020	4695140	But the reason I had good reasoning in my delusion. I had good reasoning. How's that is that rather than be
4695940	4700900	Murdered by these redneck cops and their friends. I would be going put into a proper jail
4701620	4706740	with real police if I had created a huge scene of some kind and then they could I could not be ignored
4707620	4710420	and then I could not be rather than being uh
4711380	4713780	Wister it whisked away in some room and murdered
4714260	4719940	That that would have a huge noise that people that are outside of the gas station would call the police and the people inside the gas station
4719940	4725540	Would call the police or into strangers that were coming in to get gas would call the police and arrest me officially
4726100	4728100	So you were witnesses, you know
4728500	4735700	So you were in fashion. I wasn't it was very bad. Yes very bad. Okay. I was so scared
4736420	4738420	So I mean it was like
4738660	4744900	It sounds terrifying. It was terrifying. I'm laughing now, but it's it's funny in retrospect, but it wasn't funny at the time
4744900	4746900	Yeah, it doesn't sound funny
4747380	4751060	Okay, so you eventually make it to new york you re up on harrowing
4751540	4756340	Uh, I was didn't want anyone hurt. So I was waiting for the like the proper time when it would be
4756820	4758500	You know, there would be no people that would be
4759300	4761620	You know caught in this explosion or the fire
4762180	4765860	So I was like waiting, you know, I didn't know what to do and I couldn't believe I'm sitting in the car
4765940	4772980	Like I can't believe I have to set the gas station on fire. I can't believe I have to do this. Okay. Let's keep going. It's terrible
4773780	4777620	Well, no, I mean, it's no, I love it. I've got it. Is this how you wrote it? Yeah
4777620	4784340	Yeah, more or less my recollection in gold's rose recollection is that you were planning to ram the car into a gas pump to cause an explosion
4784900	4786500	No, I was it was decided on fire
4786500	4790820	I mean because he's running into the it wouldn't cause an explosion is to have a car hit gas pump
4791220	4794260	I mean, you have to actually set it on fire. So I don't know why he would say that
4794980	4797060	Um, it doesn't make sense. But none of it
4797140	4803700	No, no, no, that is not the that's yeah, it doesn't it doesn't make sense without that also, uh,
4806340	4810740	It's terrible and I never I mean you heard stories of people going into these drug fuel delusions
4810900	4814820	I didn't know I thought they were just sort of like exaggerating. I didn't know it was a real thing
4814980	4819460	And you're losing control of your mind. That's a scary scary place to be. Yeah, it was scary
4819540	4825780	But in my head, I didn't know it was in control till afterwards which makes it even scary. Yeah, right? Like it's one thing
4826580	4828580	It's insane. Yeah
4829220	4831540	Um, I was insane for that time. It was terrible
4832500	4839860	Anyway, sorry. No, this is interesting. This is kind of a more depth to the story than I previously heard actually so
4840740	4844900	Okay, so fast forward a couple weeks you re-up the supply of heroin drive to new york
4845620	4851460	And you arrive at the apartment your mom's apartment building. It's your first time there since the moral
4852900	4854020	Uh
4854020	4856020	doorman lets you in
4856420	4858580	And you ride the elevator up to the 15th floor
4859380	4864340	Knock on the door your mom looks through the people you have to keep in mind. I didn't sleep for nearly a week
4864980	4867860	I mean the 36 hours is this this is we're back to no it's back
4867940	4873460	Yeah, getting to that point of that insanity that I was in I didn't sleep because I had detox myself
4874340	4879540	Uh into hoover dam. I still could not sleep. It was terrible. It was hard to yourself at about the hard rock
4879620	4885380	I would say five days or less. Yeah hard rock hotel of no sleep and then a lot of amphetamine
4885780	4888420	and riddle in that the sub buttex
4889220	4891860	A lot of it with no sleep and driving. Yeah, so it was
4892500	4894500	Yeah, that'll do for disaster
4894660	4900260	I mean, you're honestly lucky you didn't crash and really get hurt. Yeah, I mean, I know I'm a terrible driver too
4900420	4905620	I don't know how that I just get that luck man. Luck not skill at high speeds. I'm a good driver
4907860	4909860	Remind me never get me
4910660	4912660	Um, okay, okay
4912980	4915540	Up you go in the apartment building to the 15th floor
4916340	4918340	She won't let you in
4918340	4924020	This is all going according to the plan you sit down the carpeted hallway floor with your laptop and lay your trap
4924580	4927780	And then you call the police. Yeah, police arrive
4928660	4930900	Um, that gets your mom to open the door
4931940	4933940	she uh
4934260	4936020	The carpeted floor
4936020	4942980	It's carpeted in the hallway. Yeah. No, it's not there was a rug a throw rug in sound card. Okay. Um
4945940	4947940	Um
4950340	4952340	So cops come
4952340	4953540	Uh
4953540	4955860	She says she's someone over if you can't see me now
4956580	4959780	Uh, or I can't see you now and the cops say
4961300	4964500	You can go get a judicial order the next day, but there's nothing they can do
4965140	4968180	But at this point your trap has worked the
4968980	4972580	Your laptop is intercepted a bunch of data from her phone or computer
4973380	4975620	And off you go down to the lower east side
4976580	4978580	park the car on orchard street
4981780	4984180	There you're sitting in the car air conditioning running
4984900	4986900	Um
4987220	4994580	And if you start looking through all the packets then your packet sniffer or whatever it's called the wire sharp
4995860	4999140	What is it wire sharp wire? Sure. Okay, and
5000260	5002260	Lo and behold
5002260	5007380	You find what looks like an email or a password to the gmail account
5009220	5011540	You get a gmail type in the credentials
5012100	5016500	Hold your breath. I should de-hash it. There's more process, but it's more elaborate than that. But yes
5016500	5019140	Well, but ultimately you go to the gmail account and you type in
5019860	5023780	Her username and then the password that you've deciphered and it
5025540	5026580	Uh
5026580	5028260	And you're in
5028260	5030260	first step
5030260	5032260	Some more to stay
5033380	5035780	And you book yourself in to university club
5036580	5038260	With her credentials that are in her email
5038340	5042260	So I didn't want to waste time looking for a credit card number because there's so many emails
5042420	5047860	I don't know how to search through this app. So I figured this is the first thing I saw was the university club's a guess
5048500	5050500	It's easy to get to. Yep. Yeah
5051060	5051620	um
5051620	5052660	It
5052660	5057380	Because I figured I could just go find credit card numbers once I had a place to stay why waste time doing the car
5058020	5060020	um, okay, so
5061060	5063060	um
5063540	5065380	You get there
5065380	5067620	You buy some cigars since they don't have cigarettes
5068740	5070740	Um, right?
5071460	5076740	Wait, sorry to say again. I you get there. You buy some cigars and live cigarettes. They don't have cigarettes
5077300	5081540	I smoke these ridiculous cigars. I parked the car in there in their parking lot
5082340	5086740	That's right. It's disgusting. It's smoking cigars. That's cigarettes. They can handle it
5088020	5089540	um
5089540	5093860	Okay, so you start going through the emails and what do you see you see
5094820	5096260	all sorts of
5096260	5101380	Signs of them your mom and sisters returning to normal life traveling gossiping
5102020	5103860	going out to dinner
5103860	5105860	Doing all sorts of stuff that's not including you
5106740	5108740	Um, which has got to hurt
5110100	5112100	You find the wills
5113700	5118420	Um, you find what looks to you like evidence that your mom gave
5120020	5122900	Oh, I had the wills before but I found other wills. Yeah
5123860	5127780	And that you find what you think is evidence that your mom gave
5129220	5132580	Lots of money to your sisters. Yeah, not to you. Yeah, um
5133540	5135540	5 million in total
5135940	5137940	um
5139300	5141860	Okay, so you're in a lot of pain
5144580	5147140	I'm not going through all of this right now because it's just it's too much
5147300	5149300	Um
5149620	5154420	So still the university club you go back in and you search for two words notes bill
5154980	5156980	And very quickly you find a pdf
5157940	5160260	File you open it in there the suicide notes
5161220	5163780	And you go to the bathroom
5165220	5169540	And you open the window and you sit in the toilet and you start reading
5170980	5173140	And
5173140	5175140	I mean
5175140	5177140	I don't know you want to just
5177780	5179620	Tell me how you feel or do you want me to go through this?
5180180	5183300	Well, I mean, it's how you wrote it. That's what's important
5183940	5190100	It's like it's more interesting here what you how you wrote the incident with the gas station than hearing me say
5191940	5193940	That's a fact, David
5194020	5195060	So, I mean
5195060	5197060	Sure, so how did you write it?
5197060	5201940	Um, so first up your mom's letter. Okay, uh, you would the last you had heard
5202660	5205940	Was from bob at the funeral because that was a beautiful love letter
5206900	5212900	And this is not a beautiful love letter. It's page after page after page of insecurity anger
5213620	5215620	paranoia
5215860	5218180	How he's an alcoholic he even mentions Deutsche Bank
5218820	5221540	And the role there and how it you know
5222260	5224260	Why that role was not satisfied?
5224900	5227860	And it you're meanwhile the room is being filled with smoke
5228740	5234500	Your word is going to go into the hallway. You turn on the hot water. So now it's all steamy and smoky and disgusting
5235700	5238820	And one by one you read these notes. Um
5239860	5244900	There's Alessa and kushkas. There's the one to build mother
5245620	5248420	There's the one to you, which obviously you've already read
5249140	5250340	Um
5250340	5252500	And then at the back is the one to on cue
5253220	5254980	And this is an important moment
5254980	5257140	This is an important moment for you for me for the book
5258100	5260100	And it
5260820	5262820	Because this is what you've been looking for
5262980	5265060	And this might have some answers and you read it
5266420	5268020	and
5268020	5270660	You read it and you read it again and again
5271140	5277780	It doesn't make sense why it says his he apologized for being careless. What does that mean? How would he betray it onto his trust?
5278740	5280740	Um
5281780	5283780	And you sit there and you cry
5288580	5290580	You

5458660	5460260	Sequence of shit
5460260	5462340	And I just feel like maybe this isn't the right time to do this
5462340	5464900	It's not because it's not because of anything bad or like the alarming
5465220	5471060	Because this is a pretty good stopping point if we're about to go to dinner in a few minutes. Yeah, I think I think we've done a lot
5471700	5473700	Yeah
