0	4920	really just pull them out and they speak for themselves.
4920	8840	Well, let me give you an example of what I'm concerned about.
8840	14320	Like, my father in one email is talking to DVTCA,
14320	18240	someone on the board, and says, why are you sending me this?
18240	21760	I'm technically a freelance independent contractor.
21760	23880	So I should not be getting this.
23880	24640	What are you thinking?
24640	26000	What are you doing?
26000	28840	And the response is, oh, apologies.
28840	31360	Let me send it up the chain, et cetera, et cetera.
31360	33720	So someone looks at that, and they say, well, Bill Brooksman
33720	36320	is getting these documents illegally.
36320	37400	He's a freelance independent.
37400	40120	He's making it known that he's a freelance independent contractor
40120	41200	at this point.
41200	44240	So these people are sending him yet he looks at this work,
44240	47120	and he does work on this particular project
47120	48200	in an illegal fashion.
48200	50080	Why is he doing this?
50080	52400	I mean, something like that, it's so silly and stupid,
52400	54560	but little things like that can be taken really far out
54560	55600	of context.
55600	58240	And then someone in your office is like, oh, well, Bill Brooksman
58240	62400	was technically a freelance independent contractor,
62400	65040	but a board member at the same time, how can that be possible?
65040	67800	Let's look into his relationship with Anchu.
67800	68720	Why is Anchu?
68720	70480	I mean, it could just go anywhere.
70480	72080	I mean, it's limitless how things
72080	73320	can be taken out of context.
73320	75120	So I think it's a little naive to say
75120	77840	that they speak for themselves.
77840	80560	Right, but when you, look, I haven't seen it,
80560	83160	but when you, and I don't know the exact story,
83160	84840	but as you just described it to me,
84840	89000	my reaction is the board member who sent it to your dad
89000	91720	was doing the wrong thing, not your dad.
91720	93680	Right, no, I know that's your reaction,
93680	97120	but someone else with some other political agenda
97120	99520	could spin that any way they want.
99520	101440	I mean, I know, I mean, it's a risk that I'm taking,
101440	104600	and I get that, and I'm happy to take that risk,
104600	108720	but only to a limit, you know, Dan, it just worries me.
108720	111240	It really worries me that I'm gonna be the one,
111240	114560	like I'm spending all this four years learning finance,
114560	115960	getting involved with this ridiculous,
115960	120000	crazy political shit, and finance in New York Times
120000	122520	to keep my father's name like solid,
122520	125040	and then I'd sink it all, and then I'd ruin it all
125040	126800	and blow it all up just by handing it over
126800	128920	to some people that use it for their own needs
128920	130360	because I didn't do my homework,
130360	132480	and I didn't, and I didn't vet everybody,
132480	134720	and I didn't, and I didn't, and I fucked it up,
134720	137560	and I don't wanna be the one that fucks this up.
137560	139560	So I wanna, I wanna, do you know what I mean?
139560	141600	I totally hear that, but let me, let me
141640	144680	propose to you something else, you know,
144680	149680	is the out-president has been unbelievably secretive
150480	155480	about his finances, and he is then on the flip side of it,
158320	161120	you know, having private one-on-one meetings
161120	166120	with Vladimir Putin, he doesn't punish the Saudis
166120	169240	after they murder, you know, a green card holder,
169240	173920	Shumal Khashoggi, because they give a lot of money,
173920	175200	you know, they invest a lot of money
175200	177080	in the Trump Organization.
177080	182080	Like, this is a guy who is really, really doing damage
183920	188280	to our nation, and both domestically and abroad,
188280	193160	and imagine a scenario where, you know,
193160	197240	some of the material that you have
197240	202240	can actually sort of provide the seed
202400	206680	that we can then use to blow open, you know,
206680	208880	everything that he's been hiding.
208880	211680	Like, in some respects, you know,
211680	215240	you and your father vicariously through you
215240	220240	will go down in American history as a hero,
220720	225720	and as the person who really broke open
225720	230720	an incredibly corrupt president and administration.
230960	233880	So I recognize your focus on the downside.
233880	236200	I choose to focus on the upside,
236200	240640	which is from the way you describe this information,
240640	243880	and from what David said today, and, you know,
243880	248160	it sounds like it can be really helpful to our investigation,
248160	251120	and the problem with congressional investigations,
251120	256040	which is different than the FBI and the prosecutors,
256040	261040	is we, in Congress, you sort of need to have
261440	265320	a foundation to continue to investigate.
265320	270320	And if we are able to get some of these materials,
270400	272760	they can really be the building block
272760	276600	that we can then expand our investigation.
276600	279280	So it could be incredibly helpful to us,
279280	283880	even if we ultimately get the documents
283880	285860	from another source, you know,
285860	288240	which is entirely possible down the road,
288240	290560	if we are able to, you know,
290560	293800	get documents directly from Deutsche Bank.
293800	296280	But it's, you know, it's also possible
296280	299480	they might have erased them or destroyed them, you know,
299480	300440	who knows, so.
300440	302800	I would love if you could get them from Deutsche Bank, man.
302800	304320	That'd be great.
304320	309240	But we need, but it's hard because it's more difficult
309240	312320	in some ways in Congress than it is for, you know,
312320	313520	the prosecutor.
313520	315040	I mean, you should tell the FBI,
315040	317200	they should just go give a grand jury subpoena
317200	320440	to Deutsche Bank and ask for all these emails.
320440	322840	They can do it more easily than we can.
322840	323680	So.
323680	325000	Yeah, I'm sure they consider that too,
325000	326680	but I don't know, they're coming to me.
326680	328560	I don't know exactly what they want.
328560	330400	But again, I don't think I told you,
330400	333640	but Tim Lucy's coming out tomorrow.
333640	335840	So I have another meeting with them tomorrow.
337120	338840	But look, man, you're a good salesman, Dan.
338840	339880	I mean, I know that'd be great.
339880	341600	My dad was the hero, of course.
341600	344280	I mean, that would be the, you know,
344280	346520	exactly what I want as you know.
346520	349320	But I mean, honestly, I don't think I have documents
349320	351280	that are gonna really destroy Trump directly.
351280	354240	I don't have a smoking gun, but I mean, I want to help.
354240	358200	No, and that's my point is, that's my point is,
358200	360000	I know you don't have a smoking gun,
360000	363880	but it sounds like your emails provide the seed
363880	366000	that we can then build upon.
366000	368960	You know, the like initial building block
368960	371480	that we can then start to expand
371480	374560	and we've got a good foundation and a good basis
377440	380280	to be able to dig into this.
380280	382240	Sure, yeah, and I totally agree.
382240	383320	I'm totally with that.
383320	385320	So I think our interests are aligned.
385320	386160	I'm right with you.
386160	387400	I want to help.
387400	391600	I'm also enraged at this crazy fucker Trump.
391600	392920	And I want to do what I can.
392920	395760	But Dan, you gotta respect what I'm coming from.
395760	398000	Is that I just want some involvement here
398000	400040	and some oversight on my father's emails.
400040	402800	I don't want to be a part of your investigation.
402800	404480	I don't have to do anything else,
404480	406880	just some oversight in my father's emails.
406880	408600	I mean, you don't have to find me in the DC.
408600	409960	You can come out here.
409960	412720	You know, maybe we can find something over FaceTime
412720	413720	where we all just get together
413720	416800	and I show you stuff on Skype or something.
416800	419600	I mean, there's gotta be some way to do this
419600	420920	where we both-
421240	423160	I can promise you, Val,
423160	425680	that we will continue-
425680	426520	Compromise.
426520	427520	To communicate with you.
429120	434120	But, you know, we need the documents.
434560	437800	I mean, I did a securities fraud investigations
437800	438840	for three years.
438840	442920	I recently hired another former prosecutor
442920	445640	from the Southern District who was the chief
445640	450640	of the complex frauds unit in the Southern District.
450800	452680	You can vet him if you want.
452680	454360	His name is Dan Noble.
454360	455200	Yeah, I did.
455200	456040	I did.
456040	457280	I already looked him up.
457280	458120	Oh, yeah.
458120	462880	We are, you know, we're experienced financial investigators.
462880	464480	And so-
464480	465800	Yeah, no, David had only-
465800	467160	Maybe we all may have questions,
467160	472160	but I think we will be able to understand this.
473120	478120	We just hired a 25 year veteran of the FBI
478960	483960	who was the, who took on a very senior position
485600	488400	in the financial crimes section of the FBI.
489280	492400	You know, we're taking this very seriously
492400	494960	and looking into this very seriously.
494960	495800	I gotcha.
495800	496640	I totally believe you.
496640	498720	And I mean, if you're hiring all these people,
498720	500640	I'm sure you got something in your budget
500640	504440	to throw me over to DC or come out here
504440	506520	or catch a flight or even-
506520	508360	I think it's probably the news-
508360	509720	A flash drive.
509720	511080	What?
511080	512080	What's that about a flash drive?
512080	513760	Or even a flash drive, you know?
513760	516920	Like, it's something.
516920	518440	I mean, it's some kind of compromise here
518440	520640	to help me trust you guys.
520640	523920	I believe what you're doing and I don't doubt you-
523920	527720	I can send you a flash drive, but that's what-
527720	528560	No, I'm sorry.
528560	532200	That was, I meant like, when I went to go meet Schiff,
532200	534920	I said, hey, can you guys provide the flash drive?
534920	536640	I should have given you contacts for that.
536640	538520	But, because it was just weird that you wanted me
538520	540280	to give you my own flash drive,
540280	544000	which could have had millions of malicious scripts on it.
544000	546520	So I was like, let's just keep things like, you know,
546520	549120	copacetic in a sense where you give me a-
549120	551400	We have very sophisticated technology
551400	553040	where we run all sorts of tests
553040	557240	because we work in a secure classified setting.
557240	562240	So I wasn't worried about your malware.
562480	566160	We just scrub everything very, very carefully.
566160	567000	Okay, good.
567000	570240	But, no, I mean, the district office is not,
570240	571360	that's not what they do.
571360	575560	No, but look, why is it a problem just to say,
575560	578680	to put me in the room and say, look, here are the emails,
578680	580320	Dan, what do you guys need?
580320	583200	Let me show you how I set up the database.
583200	585440	What's like a first topic you want?
585440	586840	Let's do a search.
586840	588600	Let me show you some emails.
588600	589800	Let me show you what my dad,
589800	591160	let me tell you about my father first
591200	592960	so you get a sense of him.
592960	594560	Let me show you what his tone is like.
594560	596320	Here's an email where he's angry.
596320	599160	Here's an email where he's, you know,
599160	600840	trying to be politically correct.
600840	604560	Here's what he means when he says ring fencing
604560	605640	with Bill Winters.
605640	608840	You know, here's what the context behind
608840	611240	the Johnson and Johnson Quest diagnostic trade.
611240	613520	Here's what 1.1 billion, this is what this means.
613520	616480	Like, let me sit down and inform you guys of these things.
616480	617320	I mean-
617320	618760	Because a lot of that stuff is completely irrelevant
618760	619720	to what we're looking at.
619720	622920	Well, I mean, I'm just thinking that top of my head.
622920	624200	I mean, for the stuff that is,
624200	626000	oh, that's what you're trying to tell me.
626000	627640	Okay, now it makes sense.
627640	630200	So you can't tell me what's relevant to the investigation,
630200	631760	which is why you don't want me out there,
631760	633360	because then you would have to tell me
633360	635200	in order to do the searches.
635200	637440	Is that what you're trying to tell me?
637440	641760	No, I mean, I didn't realize that,
641760	644440	I didn't really understand how you envisioned it going.
644440	646280	I didn't know you had a database of the searches,
646280	648360	but yes, now that you're mentioning that,
648360	649560	that is definitely true,
649560	654040	that we cannot disclose specifically
654040	655120	what we're looking for
655120	657400	and what the searches are that we would want to do.
657400	660560	So, honestly, like, I'll be honest with you, Val,
660560	663680	I would have happily flown you to DC
663680	666520	if we didn't get really bad budget news.
666520	670440	So we were expecting a 20% increase in our budget,
670440	673120	and we got a 3% increase.
673120	678120	So that has, and I got the message from on high
678320	682840	that I need to cut as much as I possibly can.
682840	687440	And so, given your trip,
687440	688680	which would have been great,
688680	691840	was not deemed to be a necessity,
691840	694040	and so that's what got cut.
694040	695480	And that's why I didn't get back to you.
695480	697560	I would be happy to meet with you
697560	702560	and have you sort of explain whatever you wanted to explain.
703560	707520	And what I would propose is that, you know,
707520	712520	you send us the emails, we get them loaded on our system,
712840	715840	and we give you a call
715840	717880	and try to work it out over the phone.
717880	720360	Now, we can't do FaceTime because, as I said,
720360	722800	we don't have cell phones in our,
722800	723840	it's part of the reason sometimes
723840	727640	I don't get back to you so quickly is we have to,
727640	730240	because it's classified secure space,
730240	732240	we have to leave our cell phones called a SCIF.
732240	734520	We have to leave our cell phones outside.
734520	737560	So there's no FaceTime or anything like that,
737560	742400	but we can call you and we can go through
742400	746440	the materials with you so that you can give us
746440	750040	a little bit of that context to help us.
750040	754920	And you gotta just have faith
754920	758240	that we're doing a professional investigation.
758240	760920	Well, I mean, I do that.
760920	763040	I mean, like one thing I was just thinking,
763040	764640	oh, why don't you send me some keywords?
764640	766040	I'll do the searches for you
766040	769400	and then we can go over them together and start like that.
769400	771400	But then you can do that because then I'll know
771400	773640	what you're searching for is what you're telling me.
773640	774840	So then I'm thinking,
776480	778760	then I'm thinking, okay, what if I just give it to you,
778760	780640	but then I just don't feel comfortable doing that.
780640	783560	And then I'm thinking, wait, why did you guys go to me,
783560	786840	David, like for, let me just, there's one thing,
786840	788480	I mean, I appreciate, I did tell you,
788480	790760	I did refer you to David.
790760	791600	I did refer you.
791600	794560	We went to talk to David totally separate from you.
794560	796240	Well, I mean, but Dan, come on,
796240	797720	it looks like you're,
797720	800400	what it looks like from an outside point of view
800400	803600	is that you are inquiring about a source
803600	805680	from a New York Times reporter.
805680	807080	You're inquiring about his source.
807080	809320	That's what it looks like from an outside point of view.
809320	811600	And you didn't tell me about it.
811600	812520	And that was a little weird.
812520	813360	And I get it.
813360	814200	I was like, okay, they're gonna vet me.
814200	815040	They're trying to vet me.
815040	815880	And it's my fault,
815880	817760	cause I did refer you to David.
817760	818800	I did refer you guys.
818800	819800	I gotta tell you something about it.
819800	823800	I gotta tell you, we're not trying to vet you.
823800	825760	David Enbridge is writing,
825760	828280	and probably knows more about Deutsche Bank
828280	829840	than anyone else out there.
829840	831880	He is, he's a book.
831880	832720	Right.
832720	834000	How do you think that is?
834000	836240	Where do you think that comes from?
836240	839680	Where do you think the majority of his sources come from?
839680	841480	A lot of information beyond your emails.
841480	842920	I know, I know,
842920	844120	but where do you think the sources
844120	846040	that you got that information came from?
847960	851960	Well, I mean, I assume that there's a lot more to it
851960	853800	than your emails.
853800	858200	Well, you have to assume that the emails give access
858200	859840	and my access gives,
859840	863840	my presence gives access to a lot of former executives,
863840	866160	a lot of people that are still working there
866160	870800	that are under the cloak of fucking anonymity currently.
870800	872560	Okay, a lot of that comes from me.
872560	875000	David started this, same time I started this.
875000	876720	We're kind of in it together.
876720	879240	And it ramped up recently when I gave him access
879240	883040	to my database and all my contacts, everything I have.
883040	884360	And that's when that article started.
884360	885800	Well, who do you think is the main source?
885800	887600	What do you think he gets most of this stuff?
887600	890880	I mean, of course he's got his own, a couple.
890880	891880	But I mean, what do you think?
891880	894080	And then you guys coming, it just doesn't look good
894080	896320	when you're coming to inquire about a source
896320	898000	from a New York Times reporter.
898000	899080	It just doesn't look good.
899080	900920	And I wish you guys would have told me.
900920	903720	I mean, I was a little weirded out by it,
903720	906400	but David sort of said you guys were legit
906400	909680	and you guys were ambitious and you guys were very smart
909680	911800	and you were just wanting to get the emails.
911800	913400	And there was no other agenda.
913400	915080	And I trust this judgment,
915080	917560	but I still felt it was a little weird, okay?
917560	920840	And I just, I want to help you, Dan, I want to help you,
920840	923560	but I just need some oversight into my father's emails.
923560	925360	That's all I'm asking just a little bit.
925360	927120	I don't know what that means, Val.
927120	929960	I mean, I want to be there to provide some context.
930000	932640	I want to be able to look over his name.
932640	935560	Anything that's used, I want to be there to say,
935560	938480	okay, this is good and this is not good.
938480	940560	If you're like, Val, is this what this means?
940560	941800	Yes, this is what this means.
941800	943560	Like something like that, something simple.
943560	947120	I can't, as much as I would love to make that promise to you,
947120	949520	I can't, that's not how we operate.
949520	953200	I know, I know, but just like the FBI is doing,
953200	954280	exceptions are made.
954280	956480	I mean, you have an advisor role
956480	958760	next to your name at the bottom of your email.
958800	960040	You're an advisor.
960040	960960	You're also a lawyer.
960960	963360	So you have kind of two roles in this thing, right?
963360	967000	I mean, just something that I can have some control
967000	968320	over my father's name.
969360	972360	There must be something, some little bit of compromise here,
972360	975280	besides me just blindly sending you everything.
975280	978280	I mean, the only thing I can offer is, you know,
978280	980240	to regularly consult with you.
980240	981560	There's absolutely no position.
981560	983760	There's no final oversight.
983760	987120	You cannot have any insight into what we're doing,
987160	989640	to what our product is.
989640	993240	It's all like, it just, I don't break the rules.
993240	994760	I don't know what the FBI is doing,
994760	996880	but that's not how I operate.
996880	1001440	So, you know, I've really gone to great likes
1001440	1005880	to talk to you and to, you know,
1005880	1009000	to have a build a relationship with you
1009000	1011440	that frankly, I don't do with any other witnesses.
1012960	1015760	So we can't even really do a trial run either, can we?
1015760	1018760	Like I can't send you a batch of emails
1018760	1022000	and just see on one specific topic and see how that goes.
1022000	1023080	Like I was thinking of that.
1023080	1025080	Why don't we try one topic?
1025080	1027440	I'll send you some emails and see how it goes.
1027440	1028280	Start there.
1028280	1029320	But you can't even do that
1029320	1031600	because I can't know what you're looking for.
1031600	1035160	So what if you make me sign an NDA,
1035160	1038200	make me sign whatever you need me to sign,
1038200	1041160	vet me and then put my name next to it.
1041160	1042440	I'll do whatever you guys want
1042440	1044640	as long as I can have some oversight
1044640	1046040	and there's some compromise.
1046920	1049640	But put some, vet you and what?
1049640	1050840	Put your name next to what?
1050840	1052800	I mean, name next to some contract
1052800	1054640	that says Val can't talk about this
1054640	1057960	and Val is a non-disclosure agreement.
1057960	1058800	We can't do that.
1059800	1062360	Our committee rules don't allow for that.
1062360	1064000	Wow, man, this is frustrating.
1064000	1064840	Okay.
1067680	1068720	Well, I don't know, man.
1068720	1069560	I don't know.
1069560	1071920	I'm gonna have to think about it.
1071920	1072760	I don't know.
1072920	1077640	Obviously, I would like to collaborate with you
1077640	1080200	as much as we can within our rules.
1080200	1082560	I'd like to work with you,
1082560	1085000	but as you pointed out,
1085000	1086360	I don't wanna go this route,
1086360	1088880	but we can subpoena you
1088880	1093040	and I don't think that is the way this should go.
1093040	1095720	I've been obviously avoiding it for weeks now,
1096920	1100040	but I've done everything you've asked of me.
1100760	1101960	You know, you asked to...
1101960	1103880	You haven't done anything.
1103880	1104720	What do you mean?
1104720	1106720	You asked to meet with Congressmanship.
1106720	1108800	Again, Dan, I asked to meet with Shiff
1108800	1111360	so I can make sure you were who you were.
1111360	1112720	I don't care about Adam Shiff.
1112720	1115880	I wanted to make sure that you were not some crazy spy
1115880	1118000	or a crazy person on the end of the phone.
1118000	1120080	I wanted to make sure you could do what you could do.
1120080	1121320	I don't know what your experiences have been.
1121320	1122160	It's terrible.
1122160	1123400	My experiences have been terrible.
1123400	1125960	I'm telling you, I've been screwed over
1125960	1127120	by so many people.
1127120	1131280	I mean, there's crazy people, spies, lawyers, politicians.
1131280	1132360	You name it.
1132360	1133200	Read the...
1133200	1134360	Ask David about the book.
1134360	1135680	You'd all be in the book.
1136760	1139640	I'm telling you, man, I gotta play it safe.
1139640	1141840	That's why I wanted you to put me in the room with Shiff
1141840	1143520	to make sure you were who you were
1143520	1144760	and you could do what you could do.
1144760	1148440	I can't just blindly hand over a bunch of freaking high,
1149600	1150960	high-value data emails
1150960	1154360	to someone I'd recommended on the phone by Moby.
1154360	1155200	I mean, come on.
1157120	1160040	I don't live in this, you know,
1160040	1161040	I mean, maybe I'm naive,
1161040	1165960	but I'm a pretty trusting person
1165960	1170720	and I, you know, I don't know how to relate to you
1170720	1174960	if this is what your concern is that, you know,
1174960	1179760	I don't really, I don't operate that way.
1179760	1181520	I mean, I know, Dan, I believe you,
1181520	1183360	but it's like, show, don't tell.
1183360	1184680	You know, that's the thing.
1184680	1186400	You can say whatever you want.
1186520	1187840	You did, you did.
1187840	1188680	I have showed you.
1188680	1190160	You have, absolutely you have.
1190160	1192200	If you wanted me to do in order to vet me
1192200	1194160	or whatever it is that you want me to do,
1194160	1195560	I can't fly you to DC
1195560	1197240	because I don't have the budget for it.
1197240	1198080	Then come out here.
1198080	1201560	I don't have time for the budget to go to LA to do this.
1201560	1205120	So it's, you know, I've got many different things
1205120	1207520	that go on in the course of a day
1207520	1210800	and I can guarantee you that I have spent
1210800	1213160	exponentially more time talking to you
1213160	1214880	about getting these documents
1214880	1217840	than I have to Deutsche Bank itself
1217840	1220760	or to any other witnesses that, you know.
1220760	1221960	Okay, great.
1221960	1223320	So you spent a lot of time on this.
1223320	1224160	Great. Thank you.
1224160	1225280	I appreciate it.
1225280	1226400	I appreciate it.
1226400	1229920	But look, I'm frankly, you know,
1229920	1233400	I'm a little bit at the end of the road here.
1233400	1236080	I don't have anything more to offer you.
1236080	1236920	Okay.
1238120	1240520	You haven't offered me anything.
1240520	1243400	So if you want to subpoena me,
1243440	1244920	okay, well, we'll take it from there.
1244920	1246040	Let's see what happens.
1246040	1248200	I mean, that's a whole nother road.
1248200	1249880	And if you're prepared to do that,
1251240	1253360	then you're taking an adversarial role to me.
1253360	1256120	Then you will be taking an adversarial role.
1256120	1259600	And as I said to you, I don't want to subpoena you.
1259600	1260720	Okay.
1260720	1265080	So what ultimately will happen is,
1265080	1266720	in the way that Congress works,
1266720	1268440	and you need to understand this,
1268440	1271920	the difference in a prosecution
1271920	1274240	and a congressional investigation is that
1274240	1277200	the strength of a congressional investigation
1277200	1280960	is the threat of publicity,
1280960	1283680	or transparency, or exposure.
1283680	1286040	In a grand jury investigation,
1287600	1289440	there are requirements that everything
1289440	1291080	must be kept confidential.
1291080	1294120	That is not the case in a congressional investigation.
1294120	1295840	So you can say to yourself,
1295840	1298920	I don't give a shit about a congressional subpoena.
1298920	1303240	But what could happen if this gets adversarial?
1303240	1306080	And again, Val, I've been spending a lot of time with you
1306080	1307360	on the phone and otherwise
1307360	1309240	to try to avoid it becoming adversarial.
1309240	1312280	I'd like to work with you as much as I possibly can.
1312280	1314600	I'm not trying to go down this road.
1314600	1317520	But everything that you're worried about,
1317520	1322520	about the exposure of your father and yourself, frankly,
1325240	1328680	if you're not complying with a congressional subpoena,
1328720	1331080	would all go out there in the public.
1331080	1332800	And I don't think that's what you want.
1332800	1336600	And I don't think that that would be helpful to your case.
1336600	1339440	And I'm not, I really don't want it to be adversarial.
1339440	1342280	But there's nothing more that I can do
1342280	1346480	other than write, I wrote you the letter that you asked for,
1346480	1348560	so that you could see it on official letterhead
1348560	1353560	with Congressman Schiff's signature, sent that to you.
1354120	1357960	At some point, you gotta send the emails.
1357960	1362960	And we will be careful and we'll coordinate with you
1363280	1366480	and we'll make sure that you understand
1366480	1369160	how we view some things.
1369160	1371720	And we're happy for you to pick out some
1371720	1373600	and try to explain your father's tone
1373600	1374640	and the way that he does it.
1374640	1376760	I'm more than happy to go out on the phone with you
1376760	1379280	and go over that so that you can provide us
1379280	1382520	with sort of the personal context of it all.
1382520	1387520	But at this point, we don't have a ton of time
1388120	1389760	left in this Congress.
1389760	1393280	We're trying to move ahead and we really need the stop.
1393280	1397080	Okay, well, look, suddenly I'm reminded of my meetings
1397080	1399400	with John Moscow who promised me the world,
1399400	1401980	that they'd talk to me and give me phone calls
1401980	1405720	and refer to me for all these things and blah, blah, blah.
1405720	1407040	And then at the end of the day,
1407040	1411080	soon as they got what they wanted, I was cut out.
1411080	1412560	And that's what I'm thinking of.
1412560	1414280	And that's just one example.
1414280	1415920	And you wanna talk about Glenn?
1415920	1417480	I don't know who John Moscow is.
1417480	1420720	Yeah, you did last time we spoke, John Moscow.
1420720	1425120	Baker Hostetler represents Natalia Veselnitskaya
1425120	1428500	and hires Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS, John Moscow.
1429800	1431460	Used to work with SDNY.
1432720	1434440	Well, I mean, there are a lot of people at SDNY.
1434440	1436720	I never worked with John Moscow.
1436720	1438560	Well, you look them up.
1438560	1440640	Anyway, this is where I'm hearing.
1440640	1443680	And look, man, it just feels so adversarial.
1443680	1445800	All I wanted to do was help, you know,
1445800	1448520	and all I wanted to do was have some say
1448520	1450760	in how my father's things were used.
1450760	1451880	That's all I want.
1451880	1452960	And you're saying no.
1452960	1456200	I mean, you say that as if it's so to a simple request.
1456200	1458600	Like, you're not a part of our investigation,
1458600	1460520	our committee, you're a witness.
1460520	1464520	You have, actually, you're just really a custodian
1464520	1469360	of emails that are relevant to our investigation.
1469360	1472120	An any good prosecutor or investigator.
1472120	1473700	From your point of view,
1473700	1476100	from your point of view, I'm a custodian of emails.
1476100	1477820	From my point of view, I'm a custodian
1477820	1480500	and curator of my father's name.
1480500	1482620	That's maybe you're not quite getting that still.
1482620	1483460	And how important.
1483460	1485820	Imagine if it was your father, what would you do?
1485820	1488500	You do anything you can to protect him, right?
1489980	1491820	I mean, I don't know your relationship with your father,
1491820	1494260	but put yourself in my position.
1494260	1495660	Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
1495660	1497300	But I mean, someone that, it's like a father,
1497300	1498700	like figure to you.
1498700	1501620	You do anything to protect them and their name, right?
1501620	1502900	And that's what I'm doing.
1502900	1505100	And I don't know why I'm getting so much guff
1505100	1506620	for trying to do this from you guys.
1506620	1509740	I mean, if you want to, it feels so adversarial, man.
1509740	1511380	Like you want to come out, I mean, with a subpoena,
1511380	1513380	that's fine, but be prepared.
1513380	1514660	There is, you will, I mean,
1514660	1516860	you don't look good what you're doing right now.
1516860	1517900	It doesn't look good for you.
1517900	1520180	You want to come out with a subpoena, then fine.
1520180	1523820	Then you all of a sudden, you're tagging New York Times
1523820	1526380	for their sources, your promise.
1526380	1527420	I mean, come on, man.
1527420	1528580	It doesn't look good what you're doing.
1528580	1531860	You're taking the son of a esteemed banker
1531860	1534460	and trying to pressure him to giving you all this shit.
1534460	1535780	And without any oversight,
1535780	1536620	without any control over his name,
1536620	1537620	it doesn't look good for you.
1537620	1538460	You want to do that?
1538460	1539300	There's men.
1539300	1540140	I will tell you that.
1540140	1540980	I will tell you one thing.
1540980	1541820	What?
1541820	1545540	I have never in all of my career had anyone
1545540	1549540	who provided documents with, you know,
1549540	1552460	with the number and the degree of strings
1552460	1554980	that you are trying to attach to it.
1554980	1558540	And I recognize your concern about your father's reputation.
1558540	1561660	And I fully, fully understand that
1561660	1563860	contrary to what you're saying.
1563860	1567340	I resent you saying that we met with David Enridge,
1567340	1570140	you know, for anything related to you.
1570140	1571900	But you talked about me.
1571900	1572740	You did.
1572740	1573580	You asked him about me.
1573580	1575420	You asked him if I was crazy,
1575420	1577180	if we asked him about the FBI.
1577180	1578340	You asked him everything.
1578340	1579940	I mean, you think David's not going to tell me?
1579940	1582660	I didn't ask, I didn't ask whether you were crazy or not.
1582660	1584500	Well, I mean, if you said, if you were to find out,
1584500	1585700	like, what's with the FBI?
1585700	1588100	You asked if I was like, well, what is this?
1588100	1590940	What was the word you guys used?
1590940	1591780	I don't know.
1591780	1593060	You were baffled by me or something.
1593060	1595580	You didn't know if I was making up
1595580	1597940	if I wanted a free trip to DC for God's sakes.
1597940	1598940	I mean, come on, man.
1598940	1601220	You asked a reporter about his source.
1601220	1603060	You interrogated him about his source.
1603060	1604220	It doesn't look good.
1605140	1607100	Okay, maybe the rest of the conversation
1607100	1608420	was about Deutsche Bank.
1608420	1611420	Before you start accusing me of doing it.
1611420	1612740	I'm not accusing you, man.
1612740	1614380	I'm not accusing you.
1614380	1616980	I went to that meeting with David Enridge.
1616980	1619820	I'm totally unrelated to you, okay?
1619820	1621340	Yes, did your name come up?
1621340	1626100	It did because you are proving to be very, very difficult
1626100	1629100	to deal with in obtaining these emails when,
1629100	1632220	and I'm surprised because you reached out to us.
1632220	1633500	I didn't know about these emails,
1633500	1635700	but for the fact that you reached out to us.
1635700	1638300	Right, I get it.
1638300	1639700	I want it, I want-
1639700	1642260	And yet now there are all these strings attached
1642260	1643260	and all these-
1643260	1644860	All these strings.
1644860	1647100	I'm asking you to do one simple thing,
1647100	1649060	and that's let me have some oversight.
1649060	1651300	You say it's a simple thing, it's not a simple thing.
1651300	1652500	I didn't hear a smart guy.
1652500	1654860	You can figure out a way to make it happen, man.
1654860	1655780	You can figure it out.
1655780	1657180	I can figure shit out on my own.
1657180	1658660	You can do the same thing too.
1658660	1660540	There's must be a way to make it happen.
1660540	1661940	It's really simple.
1661940	1663580	I'll just want some oversight.
1663580	1665900	What that looks like, show me what that looks like to you.
1665900	1666740	Something.
1666740	1668820	It's my father, for God's sakes, man.
1670900	1671740	All right, Bob.
1671740	1672580	You do what you need to do
1672580	1673980	and I'll do what I need to do.
1674020	1674860	Okay.
1674860	1675700	Okay.
1675700	1676700	All right, bye.
1677900	1678740	Jesus.
1678740	1679740	What did he say?
1679740	1681060	I did?
1681060	1682180	Okay.
1682180	1683580	He said, okay, you do what you need to do.
1683580	1684780	I do what I need to do.
1687180	1688020	That's right.
