1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
really just pull them out and they speak for themselves.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,840
Well, let me give you an example of what I'm concerned about.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,320
Like, my father in one email is talking to DVTCA,

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
someone on the board, and says, why are you sending me this?

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm technically a freelance independent contractor.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,880
So I should not be getting this.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,640
What are you thinking?

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,000
What are you doing?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,840
And the response is, oh, apologies.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,360
Let me send it up the chain, et cetera, et cetera.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,720
So someone looks at that, and they say, well, Bill Brooksman

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,320
is getting these documents illegally.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,400
He's a freelance independent.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,120
He's making it known that he's a freelance independent contractor

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,200
at this point.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,240
So these people are sending him yet he looks at this work,

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,120
and he does work on this particular project

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,200
in an illegal fashion.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,080
Why is he doing this?

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,400
I mean, something like that, it's so silly and stupid,

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,560
but little things like that can be taken really far out

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,600
of context.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,240
And then someone in your office is like, oh, well, Bill Brooksman

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,400
was technically a freelance independent contractor,

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,040
but a board member at the same time, how can that be possible?

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,800
Let's look into his relationship with Anchu.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,720
Why is Anchu?

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,480
I mean, it could just go anywhere.

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,080
I mean, it's limitless how things

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,320
can be taken out of context.

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,120
So I think it's a little naive to say

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,840
that they speak for themselves.

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
Right, but when you, look, I haven't seen it,

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,160
but when you, and I don't know the exact story,

35
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,840
but as you just described it to me,

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,000
my reaction is the board member who sent it to your dad

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,720
was doing the wrong thing, not your dad.

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,680
Right, no, I know that's your reaction,

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,120
but someone else with some other political agenda

40
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,520
could spin that any way they want.

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,440
I mean, I know, I mean, it's a risk that I'm taking,

42
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,600
and I get that, and I'm happy to take that risk,

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,720
but only to a limit, you know, Dan, it just worries me.

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,240
It really worries me that I'm gonna be the one,

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,560
like I'm spending all this four years learning finance,

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,960
getting involved with this ridiculous,

47
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,000
crazy political shit, and finance in New York Times

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,520
to keep my father's name like solid,

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,040
and then I'd sink it all, and then I'd ruin it all

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,800
and blow it all up just by handing it over

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,920
to some people that use it for their own needs

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,360
because I didn't do my homework,

53
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,480
and I didn't, and I didn't vet everybody,

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,720
and I didn't, and I didn't, and I fucked it up,

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,560
and I don't wanna be the one that fucks this up.

56
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,560
So I wanna, I wanna, do you know what I mean?

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,600
I totally hear that, but let me, let me

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,680
propose to you something else, you know,

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,680
is the out-president has been unbelievably secretive

60
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,480
about his finances, and he is then on the flip side of it,

61
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,120
you know, having private one-on-one meetings

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,120
with Vladimir Putin, he doesn't punish the Saudis

63
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,240
after they murder, you know, a green card holder,

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,920
Shumal Khashoggi, because they give a lot of money,

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
you know, they invest a lot of money

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,080
in the Trump Organization.

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Like, this is a guy who is really, really doing damage

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,280
to our nation, and both domestically and abroad,

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,160
and imagine a scenario where, you know,

70
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,240
some of the material that you have

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,240
can actually sort of provide the seed

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,680
that we can then use to blow open, you know,

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,880
everything that he's been hiding.

74
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,680
Like, in some respects, you know,

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,240
you and your father vicariously through you

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,240
will go down in American history as a hero,

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,720
and as the person who really broke open

78
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,720
an incredibly corrupt president and administration.

79
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,880
So I recognize your focus on the downside.

80
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,200
I choose to focus on the upside,

81
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,640
which is from the way you describe this information,

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,880
and from what David said today, and, you know,

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,160
it sounds like it can be really helpful to our investigation,

84
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,120
and the problem with congressional investigations,

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,040
which is different than the FBI and the prosecutors,

86
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,040
is we, in Congress, you sort of need to have

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,320
a foundation to continue to investigate.

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,320
And if we are able to get some of these materials,

89
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,760
they can really be the building block

90
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,600
that we can then expand our investigation.

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,280
So it could be incredibly helpful to us,

92
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,880
even if we ultimately get the documents

93
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,860
from another source, you know,

94
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,240
which is entirely possible down the road,

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
if we are able to, you know,

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,800
get documents directly from Deutsche Bank.

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,280
But it's, you know, it's also possible

98
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,480
they might have erased them or destroyed them, you know,

99
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,440
who knows, so.

100
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,800
I would love if you could get them from Deutsche Bank, man.

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,320
That'd be great.

102
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,240
But we need, but it's hard because it's more difficult

103
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,320
in some ways in Congress than it is for, you know,

104
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,520
the prosecutor.

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,040
I mean, you should tell the FBI,

106
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,200
they should just go give a grand jury subpoena

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,440
to Deutsche Bank and ask for all these emails.

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,840
They can do it more easily than we can.

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
So.

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, I'm sure they consider that too,

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
but I don't know, they're coming to me.

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,560
I don't know exactly what they want.

113
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
But again, I don't think I told you,

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,640
but Tim Lucy's coming out tomorrow.

115
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,840
So I have another meeting with them tomorrow.

116
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,840
But look, man, you're a good salesman, Dan.

117
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,880
I mean, I know that'd be great.

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,600
My dad was the hero, of course.

119
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,280
I mean, that would be the, you know,

120
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,520
exactly what I want as you know.

121
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,320
But I mean, honestly, I don't think I have documents

122
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,280
that are gonna really destroy Trump directly.

123
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
I don't have a smoking gun, but I mean, I want to help.

124
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,200
No, and that's my point is, that's my point is,

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
I know you don't have a smoking gun,

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,880
but it sounds like your emails provide the seed

127
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,000
that we can then build upon.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,960
You know, the like initial building block

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,480
that we can then start to expand

130
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,560
and we've got a good foundation and a good basis

131
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,280
to be able to dig into this.

132
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,240
Sure, yeah, and I totally agree.

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,320
I'm totally with that.

134
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
So I think our interests are aligned.

135
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm right with you.

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,400
I want to help.

137
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm also enraged at this crazy fucker Trump.

138
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
And I want to do what I can.

139
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,760
But Dan, you gotta respect what I'm coming from.

140
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Is that I just want some involvement here

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
and some oversight on my father's emails.

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,800
I don't want to be a part of your investigation.

143
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,480
I don't have to do anything else,

144
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,880
just some oversight in my father's emails.

145
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,600
I mean, you don't have to find me in the DC.

146
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,960
You can come out here.

147
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,720
You know, maybe we can find something over FaceTime

148
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
where we all just get together

149
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,800
and I show you stuff on Skype or something.

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,600
I mean, there's gotta be some way to do this

151
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,920
where we both-

152
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,160
I can promise you, Val,

153
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,680
that we will continue-

154
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Compromise.

155
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
To communicate with you.

156
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,120
But, you know, we need the documents.

157
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,800
I mean, I did a securities fraud investigations

158
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,840
for three years.

159
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,920
I recently hired another former prosecutor

160
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,640
from the Southern District who was the chief

161
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,640
of the complex frauds unit in the Southern District.

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,680
You can vet him if you want.

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,360
His name is Dan Noble.

164
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,200
Yeah, I did.

165
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
I did.

166
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,280
I already looked him up.

167
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
Oh, yeah.

168
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,880
We are, you know, we're experienced financial investigators.

169
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,480
And so-

170
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah, no, David had only-

171
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
Maybe we all may have questions,

172
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,160
but I think we will be able to understand this.

173
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,120
We just hired a 25 year veteran of the FBI

174
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,960
who was the, who took on a very senior position

175
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
in the financial crimes section of the FBI.

176
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,400
You know, we're taking this very seriously

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,960
and looking into this very seriously.

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
I gotcha.

179
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,640
I totally believe you.

180
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,720
And I mean, if you're hiring all these people,

181
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,640
I'm sure you got something in your budget

182
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,440
to throw me over to DC or come out here

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,520
or catch a flight or even-

184
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,360
I think it's probably the news-

185
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,720
A flash drive.

186
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,080
What?

187
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
What's that about a flash drive?

188
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,760
Or even a flash drive, you know?

189
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,920
Like, it's something.

190
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,440
I mean, it's some kind of compromise here

191
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,640
to help me trust you guys.

192
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,920
I believe what you're doing and I don't doubt you-

193
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,720
I can send you a flash drive, but that's what-

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,560
No, I'm sorry.

195
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,200
That was, I meant like, when I went to go meet Schiff,

196
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,920
I said, hey, can you guys provide the flash drive?

197
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,640
I should have given you contacts for that.

198
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,520
But, because it was just weird that you wanted me

199
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,280
to give you my own flash drive,

200
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,000
which could have had millions of malicious scripts on it.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,520
So I was like, let's just keep things like, you know,

202
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,120
copacetic in a sense where you give me a-

203
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,400
We have very sophisticated technology

204
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
where we run all sorts of tests

205
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,240
because we work in a secure classified setting.

206
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,240
So I wasn't worried about your malware.

207
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,160
We just scrub everything very, very carefully.

208
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, good.

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,240
But, no, I mean, the district office is not,

210
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,360
that's not what they do.

211
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,560
No, but look, why is it a problem just to say,

212
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,680
to put me in the room and say, look, here are the emails,

213
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,320
Dan, what do you guys need?

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,200
Let me show you how I set up the database.

215
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
What's like a first topic you want?

216
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's do a search.

217
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,600
Let me show you some emails.

218
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Let me show you what my dad,

219
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,160
let me tell you about my father first

220
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,960
so you get a sense of him.

221
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,560
Let me show you what his tone is like.

222
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
Here's an email where he's angry.

223
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,160
Here's an email where he's, you know,

224
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,840
trying to be politically correct.

225
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,560
Here's what he means when he says ring fencing

226
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,640
with Bill Winters.

227
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,840
You know, here's what the context behind

228
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,240
the Johnson and Johnson Quest diagnostic trade.

229
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,520
Here's what 1.1 billion, this is what this means.

230
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,480
Like, let me sit down and inform you guys of these things.

231
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
I mean-

232
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,760
Because a lot of that stuff is completely irrelevant

233
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,720
to what we're looking at.

234
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,920
Well, I mean, I'm just thinking that top of my head.

235
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,200
I mean, for the stuff that is,

236
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
oh, that's what you're trying to tell me.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,640
Okay, now it makes sense.

238
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,200
So you can't tell me what's relevant to the investigation,

239
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,760
which is why you don't want me out there,

240
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
because then you would have to tell me

241
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,200
in order to do the searches.

242
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,440
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,760
No, I mean, I didn't realize that,

244
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,440
I didn't really understand how you envisioned it going.

245
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,280
I didn't know you had a database of the searches,

246
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,360
but yes, now that you're mentioning that,

247
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,560
that is definitely true,

248
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,040
that we cannot disclose specifically

249
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,120
what we're looking for

250
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,400
and what the searches are that we would want to do.

251
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,560
So, honestly, like, I'll be honest with you, Val,

252
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,680
I would have happily flown you to DC

253
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,520
if we didn't get really bad budget news.

254
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,440
So we were expecting a 20% increase in our budget,

255
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,120
and we got a 3% increase.

256
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,120
So that has, and I got the message from on high

257
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,840
that I need to cut as much as I possibly can.

258
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,440
And so, given your trip,

259
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
which would have been great,

260
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,840
was not deemed to be a necessity,

261
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,040
and so that's what got cut.

262
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,480
And that's why I didn't get back to you.

263
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,560
I would be happy to meet with you

264
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,560
and have you sort of explain whatever you wanted to explain.

265
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,520
And what I would propose is that, you know,

266
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
you send us the emails, we get them loaded on our system,

267
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,840
and we give you a call

268
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,880
and try to work it out over the phone.

269
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,360
Now, we can't do FaceTime because, as I said,

270
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,800
we don't have cell phones in our,

271
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,840
it's part of the reason sometimes

272
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,640
I don't get back to you so quickly is we have to,

273
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,240
because it's classified secure space,

274
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
we have to leave our cell phones called a SCIF.

275
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,520
We have to leave our cell phones outside.

276
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,560
So there's no FaceTime or anything like that,

277
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,400
but we can call you and we can go through

278
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,440
the materials with you so that you can give us

279
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,040
a little bit of that context to help us.

280
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,920
And you gotta just have faith

281
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,240
that we're doing a professional investigation.

282
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,920
Well, I mean, I do that.

283
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,040
I mean, like one thing I was just thinking,

284
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,640
oh, why don't you send me some keywords?

285
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,040
I'll do the searches for you

286
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,400
and then we can go over them together and start like that.

287
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
But then you can do that because then I'll know

288
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,640
what you're searching for is what you're telling me.

289
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,840
So then I'm thinking,

290
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,760
then I'm thinking, okay, what if I just give it to you,

291
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,640
but then I just don't feel comfortable doing that.

292
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,560
And then I'm thinking, wait, why did you guys go to me,

293
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,840
David, like for, let me just, there's one thing,

294
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,480
I mean, I appreciate, I did tell you,

295
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,760
I did refer you to David.

296
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,600
I did refer you.

297
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
We went to talk to David totally separate from you.

298
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
Well, I mean, but Dan, come on,

299
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,720
it looks like you're,

300
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,400
what it looks like from an outside point of view

301
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,600
is that you are inquiring about a source

302
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
from a New York Times reporter.

303
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,080
You're inquiring about his source.

304
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,320
That's what it looks like from an outside point of view.

305
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,600
And you didn't tell me about it.

306
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,520
And that was a little weird.

307
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,360
And I get it.

308
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,200
I was like, okay, they're gonna vet me.

309
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,040
They're trying to vet me.

310
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,880
And it's my fault,

311
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,760
cause I did refer you to David.

312
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,800
I did refer you guys.

313
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I gotta tell you something about it.

314
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I gotta tell you, we're not trying to vet you.

315
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,760
David Enbridge is writing,

316
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,280
and probably knows more about Deutsche Bank

317
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,840
than anyone else out there.

318
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,880
He is, he's a book.

319
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,720
Right.

320
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,000
How do you think that is?

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
Where do you think that comes from?

322
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
Where do you think the majority of his sources come from?

323
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,480
A lot of information beyond your emails.

324
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,920
I know, I know,

325
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,120
but where do you think the sources

326
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,040
that you got that information came from?

327
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Well, I mean, I assume that there's a lot more to it

328
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,800
than your emails.

329
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,200
Well, you have to assume that the emails give access

330
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,840
and my access gives,

331
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,840
my presence gives access to a lot of former executives,

332
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,160
a lot of people that are still working there

333
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,800
that are under the cloak of fucking anonymity currently.

334
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
Okay, a lot of that comes from me.

335
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,000
David started this, same time I started this.

336
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,720
We're kind of in it together.

337
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,240
And it ramped up recently when I gave him access

338
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,040
to my database and all my contacts, everything I have.

339
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,360
And that's when that article started.

340
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,800
Well, who do you think is the main source?

341
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
What do you think he gets most of this stuff?

342
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,880
I mean, of course he's got his own, a couple.

343
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
But I mean, what do you think?

344
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,080
And then you guys coming, it just doesn't look good

345
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,320
when you're coming to inquire about a source

346
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
from a New York Times reporter.

347
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,080
It just doesn't look good.

348
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,920
And I wish you guys would have told me.

349
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,720
I mean, I was a little weirded out by it,

350
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,400
but David sort of said you guys were legit

351
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,680
and you guys were ambitious and you guys were very smart

352
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,800
and you were just wanting to get the emails.

353
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,400
And there was no other agenda.

354
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,080
And I trust this judgment,

355
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,560
but I still felt it was a little weird, okay?

356
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,840
And I just, I want to help you, Dan, I want to help you,

357
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,560
but I just need some oversight into my father's emails.

358
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,360
That's all I'm asking just a little bit.

359
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
I don't know what that means, Val.

360
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,960
I mean, I want to be there to provide some context.

361
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,640
I want to be able to look over his name.

362
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,560
Anything that's used, I want to be there to say,

363
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,480
okay, this is good and this is not good.

364
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
If you're like, Val, is this what this means?

365
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
Yes, this is what this means.

366
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,560
Like something like that, something simple.

367
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,120
I can't, as much as I would love to make that promise to you,

368
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,520
I can't, that's not how we operate.

369
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,200
I know, I know, but just like the FBI is doing,

370
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,280
exceptions are made.

371
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,480
I mean, you have an advisor role

372
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,760
next to your name at the bottom of your email.

373
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,040
You're an advisor.

374
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,960
You're also a lawyer.

375
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,360
So you have kind of two roles in this thing, right?

376
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,000
I mean, just something that I can have some control

377
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,320
over my father's name.

378
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
There must be something, some little bit of compromise here,

379
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,280
besides me just blindly sending you everything.

380
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,280
I mean, the only thing I can offer is, you know,

381
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,240
to regularly consult with you.

382
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,560
There's absolutely no position.

383
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,760
There's no final oversight.

384
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,120
You cannot have any insight into what we're doing,

385
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,640
to what our product is.

386
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,240
It's all like, it just, I don't break the rules.

387
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,760
I don't know what the FBI is doing,

388
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,880
but that's not how I operate.

389
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,440
So, you know, I've really gone to great likes

390
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,880
to talk to you and to, you know,

391
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,000
to have a build a relationship with you

392
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,440
that frankly, I don't do with any other witnesses.

393
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,760
So we can't even really do a trial run either, can we?

394
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Like I can't send you a batch of emails

395
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,000
and just see on one specific topic and see how that goes.

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
Like I was thinking of that.

397
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
Why don't we try one topic?

398
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,440
I'll send you some emails and see how it goes.

399
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,280
Start there.

400
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,320
But you can't even do that

401
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,600
because I can't know what you're looking for.

402
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,160
So what if you make me sign an NDA,

403
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,200
make me sign whatever you need me to sign,

404
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,160
vet me and then put my name next to it.

405
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,440
I'll do whatever you guys want

406
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,640
as long as I can have some oversight

407
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,040
and there's some compromise.

408
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,640
But put some, vet you and what?

409
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,840
Put your name next to what?

410
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,800
I mean, name next to some contract

411
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,640
that says Val can't talk about this

412
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,960
and Val is a non-disclosure agreement.

413
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,800
We can't do that.

414
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,360
Our committee rules don't allow for that.

415
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,000
Wow, man, this is frustrating.

416
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,840
Okay.

417
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,720
Well, I don't know, man.

418
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,560
I don't know.

419
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm gonna have to think about it.

420
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,760
I don't know.

421
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,640
Obviously, I would like to collaborate with you

422
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,200
as much as we can within our rules.

423
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,560
I'd like to work with you,

424
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,000
but as you pointed out,

425
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,360
I don't wanna go this route,

426
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,880
but we can subpoena you

427
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,040
and I don't think that is the way this should go.

428
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,720
I've been obviously avoiding it for weeks now,

429
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,040
but I've done everything you've asked of me.

430
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,960
You know, you asked to...

431
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,880
You haven't done anything.

432
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
What do you mean?

433
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
You asked to meet with Congressmanship.

434
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,800
Again, Dan, I asked to meet with Shiff

435
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,360
so I can make sure you were who you were.

436
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,720
I don't care about Adam Shiff.

437
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,880
I wanted to make sure that you were not some crazy spy

438
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,000
or a crazy person on the end of the phone.

439
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
I wanted to make sure you could do what you could do.

440
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,320
I don't know what your experiences have been.

441
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,160
It's terrible.

442
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,400
My experiences have been terrible.

443
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,960
I'm telling you, I've been screwed over

444
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,120
by so many people.

445
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,280
I mean, there's crazy people, spies, lawyers, politicians.

446
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,360
You name it.

447
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,200
Read the...

448
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,360
Ask David about the book.

449
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,680
You'd all be in the book.

450
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm telling you, man, I gotta play it safe.

451
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,840
That's why I wanted you to put me in the room with Shiff

452
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
to make sure you were who you were

453
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,760
and you could do what you could do.

454
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,440
I can't just blindly hand over a bunch of freaking high,

455
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,960
high-value data emails

456
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,360
to someone I'd recommended on the phone by Moby.

457
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,200
I mean, come on.

458
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,040
I don't live in this, you know,

459
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
I mean, maybe I'm naive,

460
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,960
but I'm a pretty trusting person

461
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,720
and I, you know, I don't know how to relate to you

462
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,960
if this is what your concern is that, you know,

463
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,760
I don't really, I don't operate that way.

464
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,520
I mean, I know, Dan, I believe you,

465
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,360
but it's like, show, don't tell.

466
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,680
You know, that's the thing.

467
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,400
You can say whatever you want.

468
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,840
You did, you did.

469
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,680
I have showed you.

470
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,160
You have, absolutely you have.

471
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,200
If you wanted me to do in order to vet me

472
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,160
or whatever it is that you want me to do,

473
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,560
I can't fly you to DC

474
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,240
because I don't have the budget for it.

475
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
Then come out here.

476
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,560
I don't have time for the budget to go to LA to do this.

477
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,120
So it's, you know, I've got many different things

478
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,520
that go on in the course of a day

479
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,800
and I can guarantee you that I have spent

480
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,160
exponentially more time talking to you

481
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,880
about getting these documents

482
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,840
than I have to Deutsche Bank itself

483
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,760
or to any other witnesses that, you know.

484
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,960
Okay, great.

485
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,320
So you spent a lot of time on this.

486
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,160
Great. Thank you.

487
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,280
I appreciate it.

488
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,400
I appreciate it.

489
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,920
But look, I'm frankly, you know,

490
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,400
I'm a little bit at the end of the road here.

491
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,080
I don't have anything more to offer you.

492
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,920
Okay.

493
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,520
You haven't offered me anything.

494
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,400
So if you want to subpoena me,

495
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,920
okay, well, we'll take it from there.

496
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,040
Let's see what happens.

497
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,200
I mean, that's a whole nother road.

498
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,880
And if you're prepared to do that,

499
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,360
then you're taking an adversarial role to me.

500
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,120
Then you will be taking an adversarial role.

501
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,600
And as I said to you, I don't want to subpoena you.

502
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,720
Okay.

503
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,080
So what ultimately will happen is,

504
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,720
in the way that Congress works,

505
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,440
and you need to understand this,

506
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,920
the difference in a prosecution

507
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,240
and a congressional investigation is that

508
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,200
the strength of a congressional investigation

509
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,960
is the threat of publicity,

510
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,680
or transparency, or exposure.

511
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,040
In a grand jury investigation,

512
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
there are requirements that everything

513
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,080
must be kept confidential.

514
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,120
That is not the case in a congressional investigation.

515
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,840
So you can say to yourself,

516
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,920
I don't give a shit about a congressional subpoena.

517
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,240
But what could happen if this gets adversarial?

518
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,080
And again, Val, I've been spending a lot of time with you

519
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,360
on the phone and otherwise

520
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,240
to try to avoid it becoming adversarial.

521
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,280
I'd like to work with you as much as I possibly can.

522
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,600
I'm not trying to go down this road.

523
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,520
But everything that you're worried about,

524
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,520
about the exposure of your father and yourself, frankly,

525
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,680
if you're not complying with a congressional subpoena,

526
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,080
would all go out there in the public.

527
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,800
And I don't think that's what you want.

528
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,600
And I don't think that that would be helpful to your case.

529
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,440
And I'm not, I really don't want it to be adversarial.

530
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,280
But there's nothing more that I can do

531
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,480
other than write, I wrote you the letter that you asked for,

532
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,560
so that you could see it on official letterhead

533
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,560
with Congressman Schiff's signature, sent that to you.

534
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,960
At some point, you gotta send the emails.

535
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,960
And we will be careful and we'll coordinate with you

536
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,480
and we'll make sure that you understand

537
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,160
how we view some things.

538
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,720
And we're happy for you to pick out some

539
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,600
and try to explain your father's tone

540
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,640
and the way that he does it.

541
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,760
I'm more than happy to go out on the phone with you

542
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,280
and go over that so that you can provide us

543
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,520
with sort of the personal context of it all.

544
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,520
But at this point, we don't have a ton of time

545
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,760
left in this Congress.

546
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,280
We're trying to move ahead and we really need the stop.

547
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,080
Okay, well, look, suddenly I'm reminded of my meetings

548
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,400
with John Moscow who promised me the world,

549
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,980
that they'd talk to me and give me phone calls

550
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,720
and refer to me for all these things and blah, blah, blah.

551
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,040
And then at the end of the day,

552
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,080
soon as they got what they wanted, I was cut out.

553
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,560
And that's what I'm thinking of.

554
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,280
And that's just one example.

555
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,920
And you wanna talk about Glenn?

556
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
I don't know who John Moscow is.

557
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,720
Yeah, you did last time we spoke, John Moscow.

558
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,120
Baker Hostetler represents Natalia Veselnitskaya

559
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,500
and hires Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS, John Moscow.

560
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,460
Used to work with SDNY.

561
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,440
Well, I mean, there are a lot of people at SDNY.

562
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,720
I never worked with John Moscow.

563
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,560
Well, you look them up.

564
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,640
Anyway, this is where I'm hearing.

565
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,680
And look, man, it just feels so adversarial.

566
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,800
All I wanted to do was help, you know,

567
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,520
and all I wanted to do was have some say

568
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,760
in how my father's things were used.

569
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,880
That's all I want.

570
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,960
And you're saying no.

571
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,200
I mean, you say that as if it's so to a simple request.

572
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Like, you're not a part of our investigation,

573
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,520
our committee, you're a witness.

574
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,520
You have, actually, you're just really a custodian

575
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,360
of emails that are relevant to our investigation.

576
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,120
An any good prosecutor or investigator.

577
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,700
From your point of view,

578
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,100
from your point of view, I'm a custodian of emails.

579
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,820
From my point of view, I'm a custodian

580
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,500
and curator of my father's name.

581
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,620
That's maybe you're not quite getting that still.

582
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,460
And how important.

583
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,820
Imagine if it was your father, what would you do?

584
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,500
You do anything you can to protect him, right?

585
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,820
I mean, I don't know your relationship with your father,

586
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,260
but put yourself in my position.

587
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,660
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

588
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,300
But I mean, someone that, it's like a father,

589
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,700
like figure to you.

590
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,620
You do anything to protect them and their name, right?

591
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,900
And that's what I'm doing.

592
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,100
And I don't know why I'm getting so much guff

593
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,620
for trying to do this from you guys.

594
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,740
I mean, if you want to, it feels so adversarial, man.

595
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,380
Like you want to come out, I mean, with a subpoena,

596
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,380
that's fine, but be prepared.

597
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,660
There is, you will, I mean,

598
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,860
you don't look good what you're doing right now.

599
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,900
It doesn't look good for you.

600
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,180
You want to come out with a subpoena, then fine.

601
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,820
Then you all of a sudden, you're tagging New York Times

602
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,380
for their sources, your promise.

603
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,420
I mean, come on, man.

604
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,580
It doesn't look good what you're doing.

605
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,860
You're taking the son of a esteemed banker

606
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,460
and trying to pressure him to giving you all this shit.

607
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,780
And without any oversight,

608
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,620
without any control over his name,

609
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,620
it doesn't look good for you.

610
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,460
You want to do that?

611
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,300
There's men.

612
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,140
I will tell you that.

613
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,980
I will tell you one thing.

614
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,820
What?

615
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,540
I have never in all of my career had anyone

616
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,540
who provided documents with, you know,

617
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,460
with the number and the degree of strings

618
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,980
that you are trying to attach to it.

619
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,540
And I recognize your concern about your father's reputation.

620
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,660
And I fully, fully understand that

621
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,860
contrary to what you're saying.

622
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,340
I resent you saying that we met with David Enridge,

623
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,140
you know, for anything related to you.

624
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,900
But you talked about me.

625
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,740
You did.

626
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,580
You asked him about me.

627
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,420
You asked him if I was crazy,

628
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,180
if we asked him about the FBI.

629
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,340
You asked him everything.

630
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,940
I mean, you think David's not going to tell me?

631
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,660
I didn't ask, I didn't ask whether you were crazy or not.

632
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,500
Well, I mean, if you said, if you were to find out,

633
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,700
like, what's with the FBI?

634
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,100
You asked if I was like, well, what is this?

635
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,940
What was the word you guys used?

636
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,780
I don't know.

637
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,060
You were baffled by me or something.

638
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,580
You didn't know if I was making up

639
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,940
if I wanted a free trip to DC for God's sakes.

640
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
I mean, come on, man.

641
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,220
You asked a reporter about his source.

642
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,060
You interrogated him about his source.

643
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,220
It doesn't look good.

644
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,100
Okay, maybe the rest of the conversation

645
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,420
was about Deutsche Bank.

646
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,420
Before you start accusing me of doing it.

647
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,740
I'm not accusing you, man.

648
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,380
I'm not accusing you.

649
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,980
I went to that meeting with David Enridge.

650
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,820
I'm totally unrelated to you, okay?

651
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,340
Yes, did your name come up?

652
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,100
It did because you are proving to be very, very difficult

653
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,100
to deal with in obtaining these emails when,

654
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,220
and I'm surprised because you reached out to us.

655
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,500
I didn't know about these emails,

656
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,700
but for the fact that you reached out to us.

657
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,300
Right, I get it.

658
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,700
I want it, I want-

659
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,260
And yet now there are all these strings attached

660
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
and all these-

661
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,860
All these strings.

662
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,100
I'm asking you to do one simple thing,

663
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,060
and that's let me have some oversight.

664
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,300
You say it's a simple thing, it's not a simple thing.

665
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,500
I didn't hear a smart guy.

666
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,860
You can figure out a way to make it happen, man.

667
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,780
You can figure it out.

668
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,180
I can figure shit out on my own.

669
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,660
You can do the same thing too.

670
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,540
There's must be a way to make it happen.

671
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,940
It's really simple.

672
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,580
I'll just want some oversight.

673
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,900
What that looks like, show me what that looks like to you.

674
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,740
Something.

675
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,820
It's my father, for God's sakes, man.

676
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,740
All right, Bob.

677
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,580
You do what you need to do

678
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,980
and I'll do what I need to do.

679
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,860
Okay.

680
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,700
Okay.

681
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
All right, bye.

682
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,740
Jesus.

683
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
What did he say?

684
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,060
I did?

685
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,180
Okay.

686
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,580
He said, okay, you do what you need to do.

687
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,780
I do what I need to do.

688
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,020
That's right.
