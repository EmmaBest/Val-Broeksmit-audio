WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
really just pull them out and they speak for themselves.

00:04.920 --> 00:08.840
Well, let me give you an example of what I'm concerned about.

00:08.840 --> 00:14.320
Like, my father in one email is talking to DVTCA,

00:14.320 --> 00:18.240
someone on the board, and says, why are you sending me this?

00:18.240 --> 00:21.760
I'm technically a freelance independent contractor.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.880
So I should not be getting this.

00:23.880 --> 00:24.640
What are you thinking?

00:24.640 --> 00:26.000
What are you doing?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.840
And the response is, oh, apologies.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.360
Let me send it up the chain, et cetera, et cetera.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.720
So someone looks at that, and they say, well, Bill Brooksman

00:33.720 --> 00:36.320
is getting these documents illegally.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.400
He's a freelance independent.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.120
He's making it known that he's a freelance independent contractor

00:40.120 --> 00:41.200
at this point.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.240
So these people are sending him yet he looks at this work,

00:44.240 --> 00:47.120
and he does work on this particular project

00:47.120 --> 00:48.200
in an illegal fashion.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.080
Why is he doing this?

00:50.080 --> 00:52.400
I mean, something like that, it's so silly and stupid,

00:52.400 --> 00:54.560
but little things like that can be taken really far out

00:54.560 --> 00:55.600
of context.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.240
And then someone in your office is like, oh, well, Bill Brooksman

00:58.240 --> 01:02.400
was technically a freelance independent contractor,

01:02.400 --> 01:05.040
but a board member at the same time, how can that be possible?

01:05.040 --> 01:07.800
Let's look into his relationship with Anchu.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.720
Why is Anchu?

01:08.720 --> 01:10.480
I mean, it could just go anywhere.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.080
I mean, it's limitless how things

01:12.080 --> 01:13.320
can be taken out of context.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.120
So I think it's a little naive to say

01:15.120 --> 01:17.840
that they speak for themselves.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.560
Right, but when you, look, I haven't seen it,

01:20.560 --> 01:23.160
but when you, and I don't know the exact story,

01:23.160 --> 01:24.840
but as you just described it to me,

01:24.840 --> 01:29.000
my reaction is the board member who sent it to your dad

01:29.000 --> 01:31.720
was doing the wrong thing, not your dad.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.680
Right, no, I know that's your reaction,

01:33.680 --> 01:37.120
but someone else with some other political agenda

01:37.120 --> 01:39.520
could spin that any way they want.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.440
I mean, I know, I mean, it's a risk that I'm taking,

01:41.440 --> 01:44.600
and I get that, and I'm happy to take that risk,

01:44.600 --> 01:48.720
but only to a limit, you know, Dan, it just worries me.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.240
It really worries me that I'm gonna be the one,

01:51.240 --> 01:54.560
like I'm spending all this four years learning finance,

01:54.560 --> 01:55.960
getting involved with this ridiculous,

01:55.960 --> 02:00.000
crazy political shit, and finance in New York Times

02:00.000 --> 02:02.520
to keep my father's name like solid,

02:02.520 --> 02:05.040
and then I'd sink it all, and then I'd ruin it all

02:05.040 --> 02:06.800
and blow it all up just by handing it over

02:06.800 --> 02:08.920
to some people that use it for their own needs

02:08.920 --> 02:10.360
because I didn't do my homework,

02:10.360 --> 02:12.480
and I didn't, and I didn't vet everybody,

02:12.480 --> 02:14.720
and I didn't, and I didn't, and I fucked it up,

02:14.720 --> 02:17.560
and I don't wanna be the one that fucks this up.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.560
So I wanna, I wanna, do you know what I mean?

02:19.560 --> 02:21.600
I totally hear that, but let me, let me

02:21.640 --> 02:24.680
propose to you something else, you know,

02:24.680 --> 02:29.680
is the out-president has been unbelievably secretive

02:30.480 --> 02:35.480
about his finances, and he is then on the flip side of it,

02:38.320 --> 02:41.120
you know, having private one-on-one meetings

02:41.120 --> 02:46.120
with Vladimir Putin, he doesn't punish the Saudis

02:46.120 --> 02:49.240
after they murder, you know, a green card holder,

02:49.240 --> 02:53.920
Shumal Khashoggi, because they give a lot of money,

02:53.920 --> 02:55.200
you know, they invest a lot of money

02:55.200 --> 02:57.080
in the Trump Organization.

02:57.080 --> 03:02.080
Like, this is a guy who is really, really doing damage

03:03.920 --> 03:08.280
to our nation, and both domestically and abroad,

03:08.280 --> 03:13.160
and imagine a scenario where, you know,

03:13.160 --> 03:17.240
some of the material that you have

03:17.240 --> 03:22.240
can actually sort of provide the seed

03:22.400 --> 03:26.680
that we can then use to blow open, you know,

03:26.680 --> 03:28.880
everything that he's been hiding.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.680
Like, in some respects, you know,

03:31.680 --> 03:35.240
you and your father vicariously through you

03:35.240 --> 03:40.240
will go down in American history as a hero,

03:40.720 --> 03:45.720
and as the person who really broke open

03:45.720 --> 03:50.720
an incredibly corrupt president and administration.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.880
So I recognize your focus on the downside.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.200
I choose to focus on the upside,

03:56.200 --> 04:00.640
which is from the way you describe this information,

04:00.640 --> 04:03.880
and from what David said today, and, you know,

04:03.880 --> 04:08.160
it sounds like it can be really helpful to our investigation,

04:08.160 --> 04:11.120
and the problem with congressional investigations,

04:11.120 --> 04:16.040
which is different than the FBI and the prosecutors,

04:16.040 --> 04:21.040
is we, in Congress, you sort of need to have

04:21.440 --> 04:25.320
a foundation to continue to investigate.

04:25.320 --> 04:30.320
And if we are able to get some of these materials,

04:30.400 --> 04:32.760
they can really be the building block

04:32.760 --> 04:36.600
that we can then expand our investigation.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.280
So it could be incredibly helpful to us,

04:39.280 --> 04:43.880
even if we ultimately get the documents

04:43.880 --> 04:45.860
from another source, you know,

04:45.860 --> 04:48.240
which is entirely possible down the road,

04:48.240 --> 04:50.560
if we are able to, you know,

04:50.560 --> 04:53.800
get documents directly from Deutsche Bank.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.280
But it's, you know, it's also possible

04:56.280 --> 04:59.480
they might have erased them or destroyed them, you know,

04:59.480 --> 05:00.440
who knows, so.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.800
I would love if you could get them from Deutsche Bank, man.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.320
That'd be great.

05:04.320 --> 05:09.240
But we need, but it's hard because it's more difficult

05:09.240 --> 05:12.320
in some ways in Congress than it is for, you know,

05:12.320 --> 05:13.520
the prosecutor.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.040
I mean, you should tell the FBI,

05:15.040 --> 05:17.200
they should just go give a grand jury subpoena

05:17.200 --> 05:20.440
to Deutsche Bank and ask for all these emails.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.840
They can do it more easily than we can.

05:22.840 --> 05:23.680
So.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.000
Yeah, I'm sure they consider that too,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.680
but I don't know, they're coming to me.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.560
I don't know exactly what they want.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.400
But again, I don't think I told you,

05:30.400 --> 05:33.640
but Tim Lucy's coming out tomorrow.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.840
So I have another meeting with them tomorrow.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.840
But look, man, you're a good salesman, Dan.

05:38.840 --> 05:39.880
I mean, I know that'd be great.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.600
My dad was the hero, of course.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.280
I mean, that would be the, you know,

05:44.280 --> 05:46.520
exactly what I want as you know.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.320
But I mean, honestly, I don't think I have documents

05:49.320 --> 05:51.280
that are gonna really destroy Trump directly.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.240
I don't have a smoking gun, but I mean, I want to help.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.200
No, and that's my point is, that's my point is,

05:58.200 --> 06:00.000
I know you don't have a smoking gun,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.880
but it sounds like your emails provide the seed

06:03.880 --> 06:06.000
that we can then build upon.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.960
You know, the like initial building block

06:08.960 --> 06:11.480
that we can then start to expand

06:11.480 --> 06:14.560
and we've got a good foundation and a good basis

06:17.440 --> 06:20.280
to be able to dig into this.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.240
Sure, yeah, and I totally agree.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.320
I'm totally with that.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.320
So I think our interests are aligned.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.160
I'm right with you.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.400
I want to help.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.600
I'm also enraged at this crazy fucker Trump.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.920
And I want to do what I can.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.760
But Dan, you gotta respect what I'm coming from.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.000
Is that I just want some involvement here

06:38.000 --> 06:40.040
and some oversight on my father's emails.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.800
I don't want to be a part of your investigation.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.480
I don't have to do anything else,

06:44.480 --> 06:46.880
just some oversight in my father's emails.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.600
I mean, you don't have to find me in the DC.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.960
You can come out here.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.720
You know, maybe we can find something over FaceTime

06:52.720 --> 06:53.720
where we all just get together

06:53.720 --> 06:56.800
and I show you stuff on Skype or something.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.600
I mean, there's gotta be some way to do this

06:59.600 --> 07:00.920
where we both-

07:01.240 --> 07:03.160
I can promise you, Val,

07:03.160 --> 07:05.680
that we will continue-

07:05.680 --> 07:06.520
Compromise.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.520
To communicate with you.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.120
But, you know, we need the documents.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.800
I mean, I did a securities fraud investigations

07:17.800 --> 07:18.840
for three years.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.920
I recently hired another former prosecutor

07:22.920 --> 07:25.640
from the Southern District who was the chief

07:25.640 --> 07:30.640
of the complex frauds unit in the Southern District.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.680
You can vet him if you want.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.360
His name is Dan Noble.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.200
Yeah, I did.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.040
I did.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.280
I already looked him up.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.120
Oh, yeah.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.880
We are, you know, we're experienced financial investigators.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.480
And so-

07:44.480 --> 07:45.800
Yeah, no, David had only-

07:45.800 --> 07:47.160
Maybe we all may have questions,

07:47.160 --> 07:52.160
but I think we will be able to understand this.

07:53.120 --> 07:58.120
We just hired a 25 year veteran of the FBI

07:58.960 --> 08:03.960
who was the, who took on a very senior position

08:05.600 --> 08:08.400
in the financial crimes section of the FBI.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.400
You know, we're taking this very seriously

08:12.400 --> 08:14.960
and looking into this very seriously.

08:14.960 --> 08:15.800
I gotcha.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.640
I totally believe you.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.720
And I mean, if you're hiring all these people,

08:18.720 --> 08:20.640
I'm sure you got something in your budget

08:20.640 --> 08:24.440
to throw me over to DC or come out here

08:24.440 --> 08:26.520
or catch a flight or even-

08:26.520 --> 08:28.360
I think it's probably the news-

08:28.360 --> 08:29.720
A flash drive.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.080
What?

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
What's that about a flash drive?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.760
Or even a flash drive, you know?

08:33.760 --> 08:36.920
Like, it's something.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.440
I mean, it's some kind of compromise here

08:38.440 --> 08:40.640
to help me trust you guys.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.920
I believe what you're doing and I don't doubt you-

08:43.920 --> 08:47.720
I can send you a flash drive, but that's what-

08:47.720 --> 08:48.560
No, I'm sorry.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.200
That was, I meant like, when I went to go meet Schiff,

08:52.200 --> 08:54.920
I said, hey, can you guys provide the flash drive?

08:54.920 --> 08:56.640
I should have given you contacts for that.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.520
But, because it was just weird that you wanted me

08:58.520 --> 09:00.280
to give you my own flash drive,

09:00.280 --> 09:04.000
which could have had millions of malicious scripts on it.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.520
So I was like, let's just keep things like, you know,

09:06.520 --> 09:09.120
copacetic in a sense where you give me a-

09:09.120 --> 09:11.400
We have very sophisticated technology

09:11.400 --> 09:13.040
where we run all sorts of tests

09:13.040 --> 09:17.240
because we work in a secure classified setting.

09:17.240 --> 09:22.240
So I wasn't worried about your malware.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.160
We just scrub everything very, very carefully.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.000
Okay, good.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.240
But, no, I mean, the district office is not,

09:30.240 --> 09:31.360
that's not what they do.

09:31.360 --> 09:35.560
No, but look, why is it a problem just to say,

09:35.560 --> 09:38.680
to put me in the room and say, look, here are the emails,

09:38.680 --> 09:40.320
Dan, what do you guys need?

09:40.320 --> 09:43.200
Let me show you how I set up the database.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.440
What's like a first topic you want?

09:45.440 --> 09:46.840
Let's do a search.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.600
Let me show you some emails.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.800
Let me show you what my dad,

09:49.800 --> 09:51.160
let me tell you about my father first

09:51.200 --> 09:52.960
so you get a sense of him.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.560
Let me show you what his tone is like.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.320
Here's an email where he's angry.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.160
Here's an email where he's, you know,

09:59.160 --> 10:00.840
trying to be politically correct.

10:00.840 --> 10:04.560
Here's what he means when he says ring fencing

10:04.560 --> 10:05.640
with Bill Winters.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.840
You know, here's what the context behind

10:08.840 --> 10:11.240
the Johnson and Johnson Quest diagnostic trade.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.520
Here's what 1.1 billion, this is what this means.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.480
Like, let me sit down and inform you guys of these things.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.320
I mean-

10:17.320 --> 10:18.760
Because a lot of that stuff is completely irrelevant

10:18.760 --> 10:19.720
to what we're looking at.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.920
Well, I mean, I'm just thinking that top of my head.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.200
I mean, for the stuff that is,

10:24.200 --> 10:26.000
oh, that's what you're trying to tell me.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.640
Okay, now it makes sense.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.200
So you can't tell me what's relevant to the investigation,

10:30.200 --> 10:31.760
which is why you don't want me out there,

10:31.760 --> 10:33.360
because then you would have to tell me

10:33.360 --> 10:35.200
in order to do the searches.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.440
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

10:37.440 --> 10:41.760
No, I mean, I didn't realize that,

10:41.760 --> 10:44.440
I didn't really understand how you envisioned it going.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.280
I didn't know you had a database of the searches,

10:46.280 --> 10:48.360
but yes, now that you're mentioning that,

10:48.360 --> 10:49.560
that is definitely true,

10:49.560 --> 10:54.040
that we cannot disclose specifically

10:54.040 --> 10:55.120
what we're looking for

10:55.120 --> 10:57.400
and what the searches are that we would want to do.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.560
So, honestly, like, I'll be honest with you, Val,

11:00.560 --> 11:03.680
I would have happily flown you to DC

11:03.680 --> 11:06.520
if we didn't get really bad budget news.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.440
So we were expecting a 20% increase in our budget,

11:10.440 --> 11:13.120
and we got a 3% increase.

11:13.120 --> 11:18.120
So that has, and I got the message from on high

11:18.320 --> 11:22.840
that I need to cut as much as I possibly can.

11:22.840 --> 11:27.440
And so, given your trip,

11:27.440 --> 11:28.680
which would have been great,

11:28.680 --> 11:31.840
was not deemed to be a necessity,

11:31.840 --> 11:34.040
and so that's what got cut.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.480
And that's why I didn't get back to you.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.560
I would be happy to meet with you

11:37.560 --> 11:42.560
and have you sort of explain whatever you wanted to explain.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.520
And what I would propose is that, you know,

11:47.520 --> 11:52.520
you send us the emails, we get them loaded on our system,

11:52.840 --> 11:55.840
and we give you a call

11:55.840 --> 11:57.880
and try to work it out over the phone.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.360
Now, we can't do FaceTime because, as I said,

12:00.360 --> 12:02.800
we don't have cell phones in our,

12:02.800 --> 12:03.840
it's part of the reason sometimes

12:03.840 --> 12:07.640
I don't get back to you so quickly is we have to,

12:07.640 --> 12:10.240
because it's classified secure space,

12:10.240 --> 12:12.240
we have to leave our cell phones called a SCIF.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.520
We have to leave our cell phones outside.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.560
So there's no FaceTime or anything like that,

12:17.560 --> 12:22.400
but we can call you and we can go through

12:22.400 --> 12:26.440
the materials with you so that you can give us

12:26.440 --> 12:30.040
a little bit of that context to help us.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.920
And you gotta just have faith

12:34.920 --> 12:38.240
that we're doing a professional investigation.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.920
Well, I mean, I do that.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.040
I mean, like one thing I was just thinking,

12:43.040 --> 12:44.640
oh, why don't you send me some keywords?

12:44.640 --> 12:46.040
I'll do the searches for you

12:46.040 --> 12:49.400
and then we can go over them together and start like that.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.400
But then you can do that because then I'll know

12:51.400 --> 12:53.640
what you're searching for is what you're telling me.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.840
So then I'm thinking,

12:56.480 --> 12:58.760
then I'm thinking, okay, what if I just give it to you,

12:58.760 --> 13:00.640
but then I just don't feel comfortable doing that.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.560
And then I'm thinking, wait, why did you guys go to me,

13:03.560 --> 13:06.840
David, like for, let me just, there's one thing,

13:06.840 --> 13:08.480
I mean, I appreciate, I did tell you,

13:08.480 --> 13:10.760
I did refer you to David.

13:10.760 --> 13:11.600
I did refer you.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.560
We went to talk to David totally separate from you.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.240
Well, I mean, but Dan, come on,

13:16.240 --> 13:17.720
it looks like you're,

13:17.720 --> 13:20.400
what it looks like from an outside point of view

13:20.400 --> 13:23.600
is that you are inquiring about a source

13:23.600 --> 13:25.680
from a New York Times reporter.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.080
You're inquiring about his source.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.320
That's what it looks like from an outside point of view.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.600
And you didn't tell me about it.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.520
And that was a little weird.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.360
And I get it.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.200
I was like, okay, they're gonna vet me.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.040
They're trying to vet me.

13:35.040 --> 13:35.880
And it's my fault,

13:35.880 --> 13:37.760
cause I did refer you to David.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.800
I did refer you guys.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
I gotta tell you something about it.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.800
I gotta tell you, we're not trying to vet you.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.760
David Enbridge is writing,

13:45.760 --> 13:48.280
and probably knows more about Deutsche Bank

13:48.280 --> 13:49.840
than anyone else out there.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.880
He is, he's a book.

13:51.880 --> 13:52.720
Right.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.000
How do you think that is?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.240
Where do you think that comes from?

13:56.240 --> 13:59.680
Where do you think the majority of his sources come from?

13:59.680 --> 14:01.480
A lot of information beyond your emails.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.920
I know, I know,

14:02.920 --> 14:04.120
but where do you think the sources

14:04.120 --> 14:06.040
that you got that information came from?

14:07.960 --> 14:11.960
Well, I mean, I assume that there's a lot more to it

14:11.960 --> 14:13.800
than your emails.

14:13.800 --> 14:18.200
Well, you have to assume that the emails give access

14:18.200 --> 14:19.840
and my access gives,

14:19.840 --> 14:23.840
my presence gives access to a lot of former executives,

14:23.840 --> 14:26.160
a lot of people that are still working there

14:26.160 --> 14:30.800
that are under the cloak of fucking anonymity currently.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.560
Okay, a lot of that comes from me.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.000
David started this, same time I started this.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.720
We're kind of in it together.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.240
And it ramped up recently when I gave him access

14:39.240 --> 14:43.040
to my database and all my contacts, everything I have.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.360
And that's when that article started.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.800
Well, who do you think is the main source?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.600
What do you think he gets most of this stuff?

14:47.600 --> 14:50.880
I mean, of course he's got his own, a couple.

14:50.880 --> 14:51.880
But I mean, what do you think?

14:51.880 --> 14:54.080
And then you guys coming, it just doesn't look good

14:54.080 --> 14:56.320
when you're coming to inquire about a source

14:56.320 --> 14:58.000
from a New York Times reporter.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.080
It just doesn't look good.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.920
And I wish you guys would have told me.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.720
I mean, I was a little weirded out by it,

15:03.720 --> 15:06.400
but David sort of said you guys were legit

15:06.400 --> 15:09.680
and you guys were ambitious and you guys were very smart

15:09.680 --> 15:11.800
and you were just wanting to get the emails.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.400
And there was no other agenda.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.080
And I trust this judgment,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.560
but I still felt it was a little weird, okay?

15:17.560 --> 15:20.840
And I just, I want to help you, Dan, I want to help you,

15:20.840 --> 15:23.560
but I just need some oversight into my father's emails.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.360
That's all I'm asking just a little bit.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.120
I don't know what that means, Val.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.960
I mean, I want to be there to provide some context.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.640
I want to be able to look over his name.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.560
Anything that's used, I want to be there to say,

15:35.560 --> 15:38.480
okay, this is good and this is not good.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.560
If you're like, Val, is this what this means?

15:40.560 --> 15:41.800
Yes, this is what this means.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.560
Like something like that, something simple.

15:43.560 --> 15:47.120
I can't, as much as I would love to make that promise to you,

15:47.120 --> 15:49.520
I can't, that's not how we operate.

15:49.520 --> 15:53.200
I know, I know, but just like the FBI is doing,

15:53.200 --> 15:54.280
exceptions are made.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.480
I mean, you have an advisor role

15:56.480 --> 15:58.760
next to your name at the bottom of your email.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.040
You're an advisor.

16:00.040 --> 16:00.960
You're also a lawyer.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.360
So you have kind of two roles in this thing, right?

16:03.360 --> 16:07.000
I mean, just something that I can have some control

16:07.000 --> 16:08.320
over my father's name.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.360
There must be something, some little bit of compromise here,

16:12.360 --> 16:15.280
besides me just blindly sending you everything.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.280
I mean, the only thing I can offer is, you know,

16:18.280 --> 16:20.240
to regularly consult with you.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.560
There's absolutely no position.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.760
There's no final oversight.

16:23.760 --> 16:27.120
You cannot have any insight into what we're doing,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.640
to what our product is.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.240
It's all like, it just, I don't break the rules.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.760
I don't know what the FBI is doing,

16:34.760 --> 16:36.880
but that's not how I operate.

16:36.880 --> 16:41.440
So, you know, I've really gone to great likes

16:41.440 --> 16:45.880
to talk to you and to, you know,

16:45.880 --> 16:49.000
to have a build a relationship with you

16:49.000 --> 16:51.440
that frankly, I don't do with any other witnesses.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.760
So we can't even really do a trial run either, can we?

16:55.760 --> 16:58.760
Like I can't send you a batch of emails

16:58.760 --> 17:02.000
and just see on one specific topic and see how that goes.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.080
Like I was thinking of that.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.080
Why don't we try one topic?

17:05.080 --> 17:07.440
I'll send you some emails and see how it goes.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.280
Start there.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.320
But you can't even do that

17:09.320 --> 17:11.600
because I can't know what you're looking for.

17:11.600 --> 17:15.160
So what if you make me sign an NDA,

17:15.160 --> 17:18.200
make me sign whatever you need me to sign,

17:18.200 --> 17:21.160
vet me and then put my name next to it.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.440
I'll do whatever you guys want

17:22.440 --> 17:24.640
as long as I can have some oversight

17:24.640 --> 17:26.040
and there's some compromise.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.640
But put some, vet you and what?

17:29.640 --> 17:30.840
Put your name next to what?

17:30.840 --> 17:32.800
I mean, name next to some contract

17:32.800 --> 17:34.640
that says Val can't talk about this

17:34.640 --> 17:37.960
and Val is a non-disclosure agreement.

17:37.960 --> 17:38.800
We can't do that.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.360
Our committee rules don't allow for that.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.000
Wow, man, this is frustrating.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.840
Okay.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.720
Well, I don't know, man.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.560
I don't know.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.920
I'm gonna have to think about it.

17:51.920 --> 17:52.760
I don't know.

17:52.920 --> 17:57.640
Obviously, I would like to collaborate with you

17:57.640 --> 18:00.200
as much as we can within our rules.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.560
I'd like to work with you,

18:02.560 --> 18:05.000
but as you pointed out,

18:05.000 --> 18:06.360
I don't wanna go this route,

18:06.360 --> 18:08.880
but we can subpoena you

18:08.880 --> 18:13.040
and I don't think that is the way this should go.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.720
I've been obviously avoiding it for weeks now,

18:16.920 --> 18:20.040
but I've done everything you've asked of me.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.960
You know, you asked to...

18:21.960 --> 18:23.880
You haven't done anything.

18:23.880 --> 18:24.720
What do you mean?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.720
You asked to meet with Congressmanship.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.800
Again, Dan, I asked to meet with Shiff

18:28.800 --> 18:31.360
so I can make sure you were who you were.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.720
I don't care about Adam Shiff.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.880
I wanted to make sure that you were not some crazy spy

18:35.880 --> 18:38.000
or a crazy person on the end of the phone.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.080
I wanted to make sure you could do what you could do.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.320
I don't know what your experiences have been.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.160
It's terrible.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.400
My experiences have been terrible.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.960
I'm telling you, I've been screwed over

18:45.960 --> 18:47.120
by so many people.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.280
I mean, there's crazy people, spies, lawyers, politicians.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.360
You name it.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.200
Read the...

18:53.200 --> 18:54.360
Ask David about the book.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.680
You'd all be in the book.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.640
I'm telling you, man, I gotta play it safe.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.840
That's why I wanted you to put me in the room with Shiff

19:01.840 --> 19:03.520
to make sure you were who you were

19:03.520 --> 19:04.760
and you could do what you could do.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.440
I can't just blindly hand over a bunch of freaking high,

19:09.600 --> 19:10.960
high-value data emails

19:10.960 --> 19:14.360
to someone I'd recommended on the phone by Moby.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.200
I mean, come on.

19:17.120 --> 19:20.040
I don't live in this, you know,

19:20.040 --> 19:21.040
I mean, maybe I'm naive,

19:21.040 --> 19:25.960
but I'm a pretty trusting person

19:25.960 --> 19:30.720
and I, you know, I don't know how to relate to you

19:30.720 --> 19:34.960
if this is what your concern is that, you know,

19:34.960 --> 19:39.760
I don't really, I don't operate that way.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.520
I mean, I know, Dan, I believe you,

19:41.520 --> 19:43.360
but it's like, show, don't tell.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.680
You know, that's the thing.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.400
You can say whatever you want.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.840
You did, you did.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.680
I have showed you.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.160
You have, absolutely you have.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.200
If you wanted me to do in order to vet me

19:52.200 --> 19:54.160
or whatever it is that you want me to do,

19:54.160 --> 19:55.560
I can't fly you to DC

19:55.560 --> 19:57.240
because I don't have the budget for it.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.080
Then come out here.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.560
I don't have time for the budget to go to LA to do this.

20:01.560 --> 20:05.120
So it's, you know, I've got many different things

20:05.120 --> 20:07.520
that go on in the course of a day

20:07.520 --> 20:10.800
and I can guarantee you that I have spent

20:10.800 --> 20:13.160
exponentially more time talking to you

20:13.160 --> 20:14.880
about getting these documents

20:14.880 --> 20:17.840
than I have to Deutsche Bank itself

20:17.840 --> 20:20.760
or to any other witnesses that, you know.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.960
Okay, great.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.320
So you spent a lot of time on this.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.160
Great. Thank you.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.280
I appreciate it.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.400
I appreciate it.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.920
But look, I'm frankly, you know,

20:29.920 --> 20:33.400
I'm a little bit at the end of the road here.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.080
I don't have anything more to offer you.

20:36.080 --> 20:36.920
Okay.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.520
You haven't offered me anything.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.400
So if you want to subpoena me,

20:43.440 --> 20:44.920
okay, well, we'll take it from there.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.040
Let's see what happens.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.200
I mean, that's a whole nother road.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.880
And if you're prepared to do that,

20:51.240 --> 20:53.360
then you're taking an adversarial role to me.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.120
Then you will be taking an adversarial role.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.600
And as I said to you, I don't want to subpoena you.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.720
Okay.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.080
So what ultimately will happen is,

21:05.080 --> 21:06.720
in the way that Congress works,

21:06.720 --> 21:08.440
and you need to understand this,

21:08.440 --> 21:11.920
the difference in a prosecution

21:11.920 --> 21:14.240
and a congressional investigation is that

21:14.240 --> 21:17.200
the strength of a congressional investigation

21:17.200 --> 21:20.960
is the threat of publicity,

21:20.960 --> 21:23.680
or transparency, or exposure.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.040
In a grand jury investigation,

21:27.600 --> 21:29.440
there are requirements that everything

21:29.440 --> 21:31.080
must be kept confidential.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.120
That is not the case in a congressional investigation.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.840
So you can say to yourself,

21:35.840 --> 21:38.920
I don't give a shit about a congressional subpoena.

21:38.920 --> 21:43.240
But what could happen if this gets adversarial?

21:43.240 --> 21:46.080
And again, Val, I've been spending a lot of time with you

21:46.080 --> 21:47.360
on the phone and otherwise

21:47.360 --> 21:49.240
to try to avoid it becoming adversarial.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.280
I'd like to work with you as much as I possibly can.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.600
I'm not trying to go down this road.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.520
But everything that you're worried about,

21:57.520 --> 22:02.520
about the exposure of your father and yourself, frankly,

22:05.240 --> 22:08.680
if you're not complying with a congressional subpoena,

22:08.720 --> 22:11.080
would all go out there in the public.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.800
And I don't think that's what you want.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.600
And I don't think that that would be helpful to your case.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.440
And I'm not, I really don't want it to be adversarial.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.280
But there's nothing more that I can do

22:22.280 --> 22:26.480
other than write, I wrote you the letter that you asked for,

22:26.480 --> 22:28.560
so that you could see it on official letterhead

22:28.560 --> 22:33.560
with Congressman Schiff's signature, sent that to you.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.960
At some point, you gotta send the emails.

22:37.960 --> 22:42.960
And we will be careful and we'll coordinate with you

22:43.280 --> 22:46.480
and we'll make sure that you understand

22:46.480 --> 22:49.160
how we view some things.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.720
And we're happy for you to pick out some

22:51.720 --> 22:53.600
and try to explain your father's tone

22:53.600 --> 22:54.640
and the way that he does it.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.760
I'm more than happy to go out on the phone with you

22:56.760 --> 22:59.280
and go over that so that you can provide us

22:59.280 --> 23:02.520
with sort of the personal context of it all.

23:02.520 --> 23:07.520
But at this point, we don't have a ton of time

23:08.120 --> 23:09.760
left in this Congress.

23:09.760 --> 23:13.280
We're trying to move ahead and we really need the stop.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.080
Okay, well, look, suddenly I'm reminded of my meetings

23:17.080 --> 23:19.400
with John Moscow who promised me the world,

23:19.400 --> 23:21.980
that they'd talk to me and give me phone calls

23:21.980 --> 23:25.720
and refer to me for all these things and blah, blah, blah.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.040
And then at the end of the day,

23:27.040 --> 23:31.080
soon as they got what they wanted, I was cut out.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.560
And that's what I'm thinking of.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.280
And that's just one example.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.920
And you wanna talk about Glenn?

23:35.920 --> 23:37.480
I don't know who John Moscow is.

23:37.480 --> 23:40.720
Yeah, you did last time we spoke, John Moscow.

23:40.720 --> 23:45.120
Baker Hostetler represents Natalia Veselnitskaya

23:45.120 --> 23:48.500
and hires Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS, John Moscow.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.460
Used to work with SDNY.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.440
Well, I mean, there are a lot of people at SDNY.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.720
I never worked with John Moscow.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.560
Well, you look them up.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.640
Anyway, this is where I'm hearing.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.680
And look, man, it just feels so adversarial.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.800
All I wanted to do was help, you know,

24:05.800 --> 24:08.520
and all I wanted to do was have some say

24:08.520 --> 24:10.760
in how my father's things were used.

24:10.760 --> 24:11.880
That's all I want.

24:11.880 --> 24:12.960
And you're saying no.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.200
I mean, you say that as if it's so to a simple request.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.600
Like, you're not a part of our investigation,

24:18.600 --> 24:20.520
our committee, you're a witness.

24:20.520 --> 24:24.520
You have, actually, you're just really a custodian

24:24.520 --> 24:29.360
of emails that are relevant to our investigation.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.120
An any good prosecutor or investigator.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.700
From your point of view,

24:33.700 --> 24:36.100
from your point of view, I'm a custodian of emails.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.820
From my point of view, I'm a custodian

24:37.820 --> 24:40.500
and curator of my father's name.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.620
That's maybe you're not quite getting that still.

24:42.620 --> 24:43.460
And how important.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.820
Imagine if it was your father, what would you do?

24:45.820 --> 24:48.500
You do anything you can to protect him, right?

24:49.980 --> 24:51.820
I mean, I don't know your relationship with your father,

24:51.820 --> 24:54.260
but put yourself in my position.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.660
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.300
But I mean, someone that, it's like a father,

24:57.300 --> 24:58.700
like figure to you.

24:58.700 --> 25:01.620
You do anything to protect them and their name, right?

25:01.620 --> 25:02.900
And that's what I'm doing.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.100
And I don't know why I'm getting so much guff

25:05.100 --> 25:06.620
for trying to do this from you guys.

25:06.620 --> 25:09.740
I mean, if you want to, it feels so adversarial, man.

25:09.740 --> 25:11.380
Like you want to come out, I mean, with a subpoena,

25:11.380 --> 25:13.380
that's fine, but be prepared.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.660
There is, you will, I mean,

25:14.660 --> 25:16.860
you don't look good what you're doing right now.

25:16.860 --> 25:17.900
It doesn't look good for you.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.180
You want to come out with a subpoena, then fine.

25:20.180 --> 25:23.820
Then you all of a sudden, you're tagging New York Times

25:23.820 --> 25:26.380
for their sources, your promise.

25:26.380 --> 25:27.420
I mean, come on, man.

25:27.420 --> 25:28.580
It doesn't look good what you're doing.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.860
You're taking the son of a esteemed banker

25:31.860 --> 25:34.460
and trying to pressure him to giving you all this shit.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.780
And without any oversight,

25:35.780 --> 25:36.620
without any control over his name,

25:36.620 --> 25:37.620
it doesn't look good for you.

25:37.620 --> 25:38.460
You want to do that?

25:38.460 --> 25:39.300
There's men.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.140
I will tell you that.

25:40.140 --> 25:40.980
I will tell you one thing.

25:40.980 --> 25:41.820
What?

25:41.820 --> 25:45.540
I have never in all of my career had anyone

25:45.540 --> 25:49.540
who provided documents with, you know,

25:49.540 --> 25:52.460
with the number and the degree of strings

25:52.460 --> 25:54.980
that you are trying to attach to it.

25:54.980 --> 25:58.540
And I recognize your concern about your father's reputation.

25:58.540 --> 26:01.660
And I fully, fully understand that

26:01.660 --> 26:03.860
contrary to what you're saying.

26:03.860 --> 26:07.340
I resent you saying that we met with David Enridge,

26:07.340 --> 26:10.140
you know, for anything related to you.

26:10.140 --> 26:11.900
But you talked about me.

26:11.900 --> 26:12.740
You did.

26:12.740 --> 26:13.580
You asked him about me.

26:13.580 --> 26:15.420
You asked him if I was crazy,

26:15.420 --> 26:17.180
if we asked him about the FBI.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.340
You asked him everything.

26:18.340 --> 26:19.940
I mean, you think David's not going to tell me?

26:19.940 --> 26:22.660
I didn't ask, I didn't ask whether you were crazy or not.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.500
Well, I mean, if you said, if you were to find out,

26:24.500 --> 26:25.700
like, what's with the FBI?

26:25.700 --> 26:28.100
You asked if I was like, well, what is this?

26:28.100 --> 26:30.940
What was the word you guys used?

26:30.940 --> 26:31.780
I don't know.

26:31.780 --> 26:33.060
You were baffled by me or something.

26:33.060 --> 26:35.580
You didn't know if I was making up

26:35.580 --> 26:37.940
if I wanted a free trip to DC for God's sakes.

26:37.940 --> 26:38.940
I mean, come on, man.

26:38.940 --> 26:41.220
You asked a reporter about his source.

26:41.220 --> 26:43.060
You interrogated him about his source.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.220
It doesn't look good.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.100
Okay, maybe the rest of the conversation

26:47.100 --> 26:48.420
was about Deutsche Bank.

26:48.420 --> 26:51.420
Before you start accusing me of doing it.

26:51.420 --> 26:52.740
I'm not accusing you, man.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.380
I'm not accusing you.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.980
I went to that meeting with David Enridge.

26:56.980 --> 26:59.820
I'm totally unrelated to you, okay?

26:59.820 --> 27:01.340
Yes, did your name come up?

27:01.340 --> 27:06.100
It did because you are proving to be very, very difficult

27:06.100 --> 27:09.100
to deal with in obtaining these emails when,

27:09.100 --> 27:12.220
and I'm surprised because you reached out to us.

27:12.220 --> 27:13.500
I didn't know about these emails,

27:13.500 --> 27:15.700
but for the fact that you reached out to us.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.300
Right, I get it.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.700
I want it, I want-

27:19.700 --> 27:22.260
And yet now there are all these strings attached

27:22.260 --> 27:23.260
and all these-

27:23.260 --> 27:24.860
All these strings.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.100
I'm asking you to do one simple thing,

27:27.100 --> 27:29.060
and that's let me have some oversight.

27:29.060 --> 27:31.300
You say it's a simple thing, it's not a simple thing.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.500
I didn't hear a smart guy.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.860
You can figure out a way to make it happen, man.

27:34.860 --> 27:35.780
You can figure it out.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.180
I can figure shit out on my own.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.660
You can do the same thing too.

27:38.660 --> 27:40.540
There's must be a way to make it happen.

27:40.540 --> 27:41.940
It's really simple.

27:41.940 --> 27:43.580
I'll just want some oversight.

27:43.580 --> 27:45.900
What that looks like, show me what that looks like to you.

27:45.900 --> 27:46.740
Something.

27:46.740 --> 27:48.820
It's my father, for God's sakes, man.

27:50.900 --> 27:51.740
All right, Bob.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.580
You do what you need to do

27:52.580 --> 27:53.980
and I'll do what I need to do.

27:54.020 --> 27:54.860
Okay.

27:54.860 --> 27:55.700
Okay.

27:55.700 --> 27:56.700
All right, bye.

27:57.900 --> 27:58.740
Jesus.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.740
What did he say?

27:59.740 --> 28:01.060
I did?

28:01.060 --> 28:02.180
Okay.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.580
He said, okay, you do what you need to do.

28:03.580 --> 28:04.780
I do what I need to do.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.020
That's right.
