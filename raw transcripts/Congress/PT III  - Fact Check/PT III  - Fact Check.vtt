WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
I think the position should be pretty good, right?

00:04.520 --> 00:05.520
Yeah.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.640
You want your full body, no?

00:09.640 --> 00:10.640
Yeah.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.640
In the shot.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
Me or Val?

00:12.640 --> 00:13.640
Everybody.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.240
Well, what part of me is in the shot now?

00:15.240 --> 00:19.000
Well, it's just, I mean, maybe you could just a little bit on there.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Where's your, where's...

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, like this.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Okay.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah, so where's his free man, so he doesn't...

00:23.000 --> 00:27.040
Yeah, I thought it was right around here, because keep in mind it goes, once you actually

00:27.040 --> 00:29.080
hit play, hit record.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.080
It's going to go over more.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.080
It's not over CC.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.080
Oh, yeah, because this is...

00:32.080 --> 00:33.080
Yeah, you've got room.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.080
No, sorry.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.080
Is this okay right now?

00:35.080 --> 00:36.080
Yeah, that's great.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.080
Okay, great.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.080
Okay.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.080
Oh, Kida.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
So, we are...

00:40.080 --> 00:54.880
We are in the early days of them at Deutsche Bank, and so Edson is, as I've said, and as

00:54.880 --> 01:03.080
you know, just like, he's unbridled id, and that's like, that's what he is.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.600
He's like a big bundle of id.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
And Bill...

01:06.600 --> 01:09.080
A bit of ego.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.360
Bill is more the super ego, right?

01:11.360 --> 01:15.880
He's the one who is reserved, he kind of restrains the...

01:15.880 --> 01:17.880
He's a practical one.

01:17.880 --> 01:24.800
He's practical, he's conservative, and he's just like down to earth.

01:25.480 --> 01:32.600
Sometimes in ways that people make fun of him for, like he takes the tube to work, which

01:32.600 --> 01:36.360
is crazy, because these guys do not take the tube, and they take the tube.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.360
No, he loves the tube.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
Yeah, he loves the tube.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
Loves the subway.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
He loves trains.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.360
Loves trains.

01:41.360 --> 01:46.000
I like trains, too.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
So one of...

01:47.000 --> 01:51.800
Bill was kind of running a business, but he had a co-head of the business, a guy named

01:51.800 --> 01:52.800
Martin Loat.

01:52.800 --> 01:53.800
Loat?

01:54.800 --> 01:58.800
He was a retired British military officer.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.800
What's he a military officer?

02:01.800 --> 02:03.080
He was in...

02:03.080 --> 02:06.480
The rumor was that, which wasn't true, is that he was a Special Forces officer, but he's

02:06.480 --> 02:07.480
just...

02:07.480 --> 02:08.480
He's not.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.480
He was in the military.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.480
Like, doing life in the military.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.480
I think he was in the army, I'm not quite sure what he was doing.

02:16.480 --> 02:21.520
It doesn't really matter, for these purposes.

02:21.600 --> 02:28.480
So, sorry, Bill took Martin under his wing a bit, and kind of trained him on...

02:28.480 --> 02:30.120
Especially when it came to ethical things.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.120
So he...

02:31.120 --> 02:34.760
He trained Martin on that, yes.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.760
And it...

02:37.760 --> 02:40.640
So Martin always looked up to him.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.800
Bill's mantra, which he'd always repeat, was, let's get down to first principles.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.800
First principles.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.040
Yeah, so he would, you know, let's cut to the chase.

02:51.080 --> 02:55.480
Let's look at things from boiling down to their essence.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.120
He...

02:58.120 --> 03:00.320
When there was a problem, he would be dispatched to clean it up.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.800
There's a financial crisis in Asia.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.080
Bill's immediately on the flight to Hong Kong.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.320
He reminded some of his colleagues of the wolf character in Pulp Fiction.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.440
Oh, yeah, the fixer, sure.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.520
Yeah, the fixer.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.520
Some colleagues...

03:16.520 --> 03:20.880
Yeah, and one of the good things about his restraining influence

03:20.880 --> 03:26.840
on Edson is that, you know, he calmed people when times were too good, and he made people

03:26.840 --> 03:29.840
kind of just be a little more restrained.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.480
Some people, some of his colleagues told me, a number of his colleagues told me, that they

03:34.480 --> 03:37.000
wondered if maybe he was depressed.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
That was...

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Well, because he was...

03:39.000 --> 03:40.640
He dampened everything.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.640
It was like...

03:41.640 --> 03:42.640
But if it was...

03:42.640 --> 03:47.160
Yeah, if everyone was, you know, extremely joyful, he said, we'll come back down to Earth

03:47.160 --> 03:48.160
and let's...

03:48.160 --> 03:50.840
I think what you guys described it to me is that he managed to drain the emotions from

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
everything.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.840
No, but he was...

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
Everyone was too depressed.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.840
Let's not argue about this.

03:54.840 --> 03:55.840
I'm just saying this with people with his colleagues' perception.

03:55.840 --> 03:59.080
Okay, but let me give you the opposing viewpoint.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.120
If someone was way too happy and joyful, it would say, you know, calm down a bit, let's

04:03.120 --> 04:07.440
focus on what's needed to be done, you're over, you know, exaggerating with a lot of

04:07.440 --> 04:10.760
this joy when you need to focus on the reality of the matter.

04:10.760 --> 04:15.040
If someone was too low or depressed, you would say, you're focusing too much on this misery

04:15.040 --> 04:17.160
instead of the practicality of it.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.920
There's no need for this depression if you think things through.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.920
Just like there's no need for this excess joy because there's something always looming

04:22.920 --> 04:23.920
in the background.

04:23.920 --> 04:24.920
Be prepared for everything.

04:24.920 --> 04:25.920
I completely understand what you're saying.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.960
And that can be misinterpreted as depression, depending on who he's talking to.

04:29.960 --> 04:34.520
If he's talking to someone that's really happy and my dad comes in and says he wants to burst

04:34.520 --> 04:36.880
their bubble, they're going to say how he was depressed.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.000
Don't be so defensive about the kinds of depression.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm not...

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I certainly...

04:41.000 --> 04:45.960
I just wanted to make it clear that that is very, very much dependent on one's perception

04:45.960 --> 04:47.400
and the situation all as well.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.960
So if someone's to say he's depressed because he bursted my bubble...

04:50.960 --> 04:54.160
As you'll see as we go through this, there are a lot of people who at various points

04:54.160 --> 04:55.160
wonder if Bill is depressed.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
Okay, but that's why I'm just...

04:56.160 --> 05:02.080
I know you're making the case for this depression and I'm just making the case against him.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.480
I'm not making the case for depression.

05:03.480 --> 05:09.600
I'm saying accurately, obviously, that that is the way a number of colleagues told me

05:09.600 --> 05:10.600
that that is what they...

05:10.600 --> 05:11.920
They didn't say he was depressed.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.760
They're saying they wondered if maybe he was depressed.

05:14.760 --> 05:15.760
That was how they perceived it.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.200
And during what points in time?

05:17.200 --> 05:18.200
I mean, this was...

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
Throughout...

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
Yeah, I mean at different points in time.

05:20.200 --> 05:24.400
So this point that I'm talking about right now is in around 97.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.400
Okay.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
So this is shortly after...

05:26.400 --> 05:29.400
This is a year or so after he's joined the Beck.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.400
Okay.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.400
And maybe two years after he's joined the Beck.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.400
After he's joined Deutsche.

05:35.400 --> 05:40.120
Okay, so let's see.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.560
Edson started his affair with Estelle.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.560
Yes, Estelle.

05:44.560 --> 05:48.840
Which is a wonderful story, but let's not even go there right now.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.840
But you've included the story.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.840
Oh, yeah.

05:50.840 --> 05:51.840
Okay.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.560
Oh, and Estelle becomes like a fairly significant character.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.560
Does she?

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
Going for it.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
Yeah, okay.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.560
Did you talk to her?

05:58.560 --> 06:04.560
I'm not going to get into who I talked to and who I didn't talk to.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.560
Okay.

06:06.560 --> 06:16.560
Okay, so Deutsche Bank does in the late night, in 98, it buys Banker's Trust.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.560
Yes.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.560
Which is...

06:18.560 --> 06:21.560
It turns out to be a real disaster of...

06:21.560 --> 06:23.560
That's kind of one of the original sins for Deutsche Bank.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.560
It was buying up Banker's Trust.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.560
I mean, it's a horrible deal.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.560
And it's a terrible deal.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.560
They're doing it.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.560
For buying it up and turning it into DVTCA?

06:30.560 --> 06:32.560
Well, it became...

06:32.560 --> 06:36.560
It kind of became a large number that became DVTCA.

06:36.560 --> 06:42.560
This is like the kind of real point at which Deutsche Bank went from being a European-centered

06:42.560 --> 06:44.560
investment bank into an American investment bank.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.560
Or becoming a European bank, a German bank into a global bank.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.560
You could argue that.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
Well, it was already...

06:51.560 --> 06:53.560
At that point, it was very big in London already.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.560
It was asleep, as people describe it, a sleepy bank.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.560
I think that was actually Landon.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.560
Landon Thomas.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.560
Sorry to hear about your...

07:03.560 --> 07:05.560
No, I'm not being a dick.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.560
It's just that Landon described it as a sleepy little bank at the time.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.560
And he was right.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.560
And then when my dad and I came along, I turned into a bad myth.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Right.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.560
But what I'm saying...

07:15.560 --> 07:17.560
And buying DVTCA was part of that expansion.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
No, no, no, no.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.560
DVTCA, they didn't buy DVTCA.

07:19.560 --> 07:23.560
I mean, buying Banker's Trust and becoming DVTCA was part of that expansion.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.560
Banker's Trust didn't become DVTCA.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.560
Like, Banker's Trust is a...

07:27.560 --> 07:29.560
It's an early version of DVTCA.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.560
Okay, let's just move on.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.560
It doesn't matter.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.560
It matters.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
It matters.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
I'm just wanting...

07:34.560 --> 07:36.560
Because this is a fact check, is it not?

07:36.560 --> 07:40.560
Yeah, but this is a fact check that we're doing of you and your father.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.560
Okay, fine.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.560
You're just going to need to trust me that I'm this kind of stuff in particular.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.560
Okay.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.560
I have done a lot of research before.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.560
Okay, I believe you.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.560
So, let's see.

07:54.560 --> 07:58.560
Okay, then we'll get into a bunch of Trump shit, which I'm not going to get into with you right now.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
Just purely for...

07:59.560 --> 08:00.560
Any background?

08:00.560 --> 08:04.560
Yeah, it's like the story of how Deutsche Bank got into Trump.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
Okay.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.560
And...

08:06.560 --> 08:07.560
Do you know...

08:07.560 --> 08:09.560
Do you name names here?

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
Yeah.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.560
Okay.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.560
Is this going to be breaking?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.560
Some of this has been told previously.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
Okay.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.560
Did you get off on the guys to sign the loans?

08:21.560 --> 08:22.560
What was that?

08:22.560 --> 08:25.560
Did you write down the guys to sign the loans?

08:25.560 --> 08:27.560
I think I saw that yesterday.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.560
This is about the people who started the relationship with Trump.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.560
Okay.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.560
What conclusions did you come to?

08:42.560 --> 08:43.560
Nothing.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
Oh, come on.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.560
There's no...

08:45.560 --> 08:46.560
There's...

08:46.560 --> 08:47.560
No, it's not even that.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.560
No, don't turn it off.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.560
There's not...

08:51.560 --> 08:52.560
What?

08:56.560 --> 08:59.560
Nothing groundbreaking or nothing...

08:59.560 --> 09:00.560
There's interesting stuff.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
I can get into that right now.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.560
Okay.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.560
There's...

09:03.560 --> 09:05.560
Any connections to Justice Kennedy?

09:05.560 --> 09:07.560
Nothing good.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.560
I feel like I'm the reporter and you're the source.

09:12.560 --> 09:16.560
Can you confirm or deny Justice Kennedy's involvement in the Sun?

09:16.560 --> 09:17.560
No?

09:17.560 --> 09:18.560
Well, Justice...

09:19.560 --> 09:20.560
Yeah.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
Okay.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.560
I'll let it go.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.560
Okay.

09:25.560 --> 09:30.560
Okay, so in 2000, Bill retires for a second time.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.560
Okay.

09:31.560 --> 09:36.560
And he felt simultaneously overwhelmed and bored.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
Mm-hmm.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.560
And he also felt like he was neglecting his daughters.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
Mm-hmm.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
And maybe he's burning it.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.560
So in August 2000, he decides to retire for the second time.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.560
Edson tried to keep him.

09:46.560 --> 09:51.560
The bill kind of equivocated a little bit and then decided he needed to get out.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.560
Mm-hmm.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.560
He was going to withdraw over several months.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.560
He's going to spend time with his family and still be in Shakespeare,

09:56.560 --> 09:58.560
involved in their soup kitchen.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.560
And the...

10:02.560 --> 10:03.560
What did you get?

10:03.560 --> 10:09.560
He said to someone that it was hard to do a job and we've done it,

10:09.560 --> 10:13.560
which didn't really run true, because the job was definitely not done.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
And once again...

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
Which job?

10:15.560 --> 10:20.560
Well, they're building Deutsche Bank into a modern institution,

10:20.560 --> 10:24.560
and that was definitely not a finished thing.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.560
By 2000?

10:25.560 --> 10:26.560
No.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.560
I mean, that wasn't finished for years.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.560
Okay.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
It still isn't finished.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.560
Well, I mean, it became from small to big.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.560
I think that's what he's referring to.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.560
Taking small banks is making it to big global bank.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.560
Right?

10:40.560 --> 10:43.560
What I'm saying is that to the people he used those words with,

10:43.560 --> 10:44.560
it did not run true.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.560
It did not run true.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.560
Okay.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.560
And I'm also saying that to some of his colleagues,

10:48.560 --> 10:51.560
the fact that these retirements were becoming a pattern,

10:51.560 --> 10:54.560
suggested to them that he was having some trouble covering with the pressure,

10:54.560 --> 10:56.560
and that there was a certain fragility there.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.560
Okay.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.560
And again, that's not...

10:59.560 --> 11:02.560
That's simply the way they perceived it.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.560
Sure.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.560
Okay.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
Edson...

11:05.560 --> 11:10.560
Edson is kind of...

11:10.560 --> 11:15.560
He's with Estelle and is, you know, losing.

11:15.560 --> 11:22.560
Bill's gone, and that check on him and Super Ego is gone,

11:22.560 --> 11:25.560
and he's spinning a little bit of control.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.560
Edson.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.560
Yeah.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
And that, you guys.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.560
Yeah.

11:30.560 --> 11:35.560
And I'm recounting the scene that you encountered

11:35.560 --> 11:37.560
in the Park Avenue apartment.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.560
Yeah.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.560
You could hear Sinead O'Connor,

11:41.560 --> 11:46.560
which was weird because you got a hater Sinead O'Connor.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
Yeah.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.560
And you went in and sat down with them, and he was crying,

11:50.560 --> 11:52.560
and the song was on repeat,

11:52.560 --> 11:54.560
and he said, Dad, you okay?

11:54.560 --> 11:57.560
And he said, Not really, but I will be.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
That sound about right?

11:58.560 --> 11:59.560
Yeah.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.560
I sat with them for a while.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
Yeah.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.560
You go over the whole thing.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
Okay.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.560
So Bill says he will be okay.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.560
Deutsche Bank is not going to be okay because this is the moment

12:13.560 --> 12:15.560
where everything starts to fall apart.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.560
Bill's gone, Edson's dead,

12:17.560 --> 12:22.560
and a huge power struggle breaks out to fill with those voids.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.560
And this is where Anshu starts to really gain power and climb.

12:27.560 --> 12:31.560
And Anshu, as you know, is very ambitious.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.560
And, okay, so we're going to skip a bunch of stuff right now

12:35.560 --> 12:38.560
because it's just like, there's no, actually no or not.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
We're coming right back to you.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.560
We're coming right back to you right here.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
Did you do any parallels with what's going on at Merrill Lynch

12:43.560 --> 12:44.560
at the time?

12:44.560 --> 12:45.560
Not really.

12:45.560 --> 12:51.560
I mean, if we get into a bit later, like, that your dad was doing

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
some consulting.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.560
I didn't really feel like he was being listened to by Stan O'Neill

12:54.560 --> 12:55.560
and down here.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.560
Okay.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.560
And that Stan O'Neill was trying to get him to take a bigger job,

13:00.560 --> 13:03.560
and your dad said, no, no, no, no, no, I just wouldn't do it.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.560
And any warnings about the coming crisis?

13:06.560 --> 13:10.560
There's, well, you know, I'm not actually getting into this

13:10.560 --> 13:11.560
in the book.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.560
Okay.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.560
But your dad actually, this is one of the things,

13:15.560 --> 13:18.560
there's a few things toward the end of his life, especially,

13:18.560 --> 13:20.560
that he got wrong quite badly.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
Yeah.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.560
And the financial crisis is one of them.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.560
He's one of them.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.560
He really underestimated, there are these emails between him

13:26.560 --> 13:31.560
and McKaylee, where they're kind of talking about how bad the crisis

13:31.560 --> 13:32.560
is about to be.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.560
And your dad, again, I'm not getting into this in the book,

13:34.560 --> 13:37.560
because it's not that relevant, but he did misread it.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.560
And again, it's like a misreading that a lot of people had,

13:39.560 --> 13:42.560
but he predicted, he made very specific predictions about how

13:42.560 --> 13:44.560
things were going to play out and how bad they were going to be.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.560
And he was wrong.

13:48.560 --> 13:56.560
But again, the, okay, we're talking about some of the,

13:56.560 --> 13:59.560
so you graduate from college, you moved to New York,

13:59.560 --> 14:02.560
you were taking classes at NYU, we were talking about this yesterday.

14:02.560 --> 14:06.560
You're not going to like this.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.560
I'm noting that a number, in fact, I'm saying many of Bill's

14:10.560 --> 14:12.560
colleagues knew that he had two daughters,

14:12.560 --> 14:15.560
but didn't realize he had a son.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.560
I'm also noting that you actually had a slightly warmer relationship

14:18.560 --> 14:22.560
with Bill than you did with your mom, who, like,

14:22.560 --> 14:26.560
struck some of your friends and some of the family's friends

14:26.560 --> 14:30.560
as just very icy.

14:30.560 --> 14:36.560
And whereas Bill was really trying to understand your rebelliousness

14:36.560 --> 14:38.560
and tried to get to know you.

14:38.560 --> 14:44.560
And actually say that you told friends at the time that you felt

14:44.560 --> 14:49.560
like you had been a burden to your mom ever since she fled Ukraine

14:49.560 --> 14:52.560
and why else would she have let you be dumped and fostered here.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.560
That's a direct quote from Matt Goldsboro.

14:55.560 --> 14:59.560
Did you say that?

14:59.560 --> 15:01.560
Okay, so you bounce around.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.560
I don't remember saying that, but it's possible.

15:04.560 --> 15:08.560
Does that sound like an accurate encapsulation of your feelings?

15:08.560 --> 15:13.560
I'm sure at the time, maybe, yeah.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.560
Okay, so we're going back and I'm talking about some of the jobs

15:17.560 --> 15:19.560
you haven't mentioned, kitchen nightmares.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.560
What was the thing you told me about yesterday that I didn't realize?

15:22.560 --> 15:25.560
Oh, there's the website thing.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.560
Michael Luton.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.560
Yeah, I had no idea about that.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.560
Big.com, Michael Luton.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.560
There's a bunch of websites.

15:33.560 --> 15:39.560
But I know that your main passion and obsession and love is music.

15:39.560 --> 15:43.560
And there's Good Time Charlie's, which became Bikini Robot Army.

15:43.560 --> 15:48.560
And the band was basically you and whoever you were jamming with at that moment.

15:48.560 --> 15:52.560
Describing you, he was a talented musician and songwriter

15:52.560 --> 15:55.560
tapping this deep well of painful memories for inspiration.

15:55.560 --> 16:00.560
The result was mournful, angry, beautiful guitar piano ballads like Hey Mama,

16:00.560 --> 16:01.560
in 2002.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.560
And then we've got Hey Mama.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.560
Have you listened to Hey Mama?

16:07.560 --> 16:09.560
Hey Mama's a really nice song.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.560
Thank you.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.560
Your music's really good.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.560
I actually, like, not look a smug of your ass.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.560
Oh, thank you.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.560
There's enough fucking smoke in this room anyway.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.560
Okay, we meet...

16:20.560 --> 16:21.560
It's fake.

16:21.560 --> 16:22.560
It's vapor.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.560
It's not smoking in mine.

16:23.560 --> 16:28.560
There's literally, like, he's...

16:28.560 --> 16:29.560
No, it's fine.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.560
Keep David from sleeping.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.560
It's fine.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.560
Yeah, exactly.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.560
It's like coffee.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.560
Right, the coffee.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
Oh, good.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.560
Yeah, I need some more of that, too.

16:41.560 --> 16:42.560
Oh, thank you.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.560
Let's see.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
Here you go.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.560
Thank you.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.560
Oh, this is, like, real serious.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.560
Sweetheart.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.560
Let's see.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.560
Muah.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.560
Muah.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.560
Let's see.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
Okay.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.560
So, Joe Ackerman, we meet.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.560
Oh, Ackerman is the character.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.560
Yeah.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.560
And I'm not going to bore you with all of this.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.560
In fact, this section...

17:15.560 --> 17:16.560
What is important?

17:16.560 --> 17:18.560
Because you go to the bank of Cyprus.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.560
Yeah, I know it's important.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.560
Val, just in the interest of time here, like, there's...

17:23.560 --> 17:26.560
He's a very important character in the book.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.560
But it's just not...

17:28.560 --> 17:30.560
There's no point in fact checking that with you, because...

17:30.560 --> 17:32.560
In Colin?

17:32.560 --> 17:33.560
Colin Fan?

17:33.560 --> 17:34.560
Yeah.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.560
He's in there, so...

17:35.560 --> 17:36.560
He's in there, too.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.560
We talked to...

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
Fuck, what's his name?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.560
Sabah, capital guy.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
The camera was in there.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.560
Boas, wine soup?

17:45.560 --> 17:46.560
Boas, yeah.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.560
We talked to him?

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
Nothing.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.560
We've talked to him.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.560
Okay.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.560
Because there's an interesting relationship

17:52.560 --> 17:54.560
between Boas and Colin.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.560
Colin Fan.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.560
Yeah.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
Yeah, you've mentioned that.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.560
Yeah.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.560
There's an interesting relationship between Boas

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
and a lot of people.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.560
Boas is...

18:02.560 --> 18:03.560
My dad really likes him.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.560
I know he does.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.560
Yeah.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.560
You've mentioned that.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.560
Oh, Kydoke.

18:10.560 --> 18:11.560
Kydoke?

18:12.560 --> 18:17.560
So I note here at the end of chapter 10

18:17.560 --> 18:23.560
that this is the late odds.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.560
The late...

18:25.560 --> 18:26.560
Or not the late odds.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.560
It's like the mid odds.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.560
Okay.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.560
And this is like a go-go period for the bank.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.560
And it's actually...

18:31.560 --> 18:33.560
They don't realize it, but it's spinning out of control.

18:33.560 --> 18:38.560
And the bank desperately needed someone to be there

18:38.560 --> 18:41.560
to say no, and wasn't afraid to give unwanted news.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.560
Someone like Bill.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.560
Okay.

18:43.560 --> 18:44.560
But Bill wasn't there.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.560
In fact, Bill was...

18:46.560 --> 18:48.560
In the months after the Edson died,

18:48.560 --> 18:51.560
had been very glad that he no longer worked in the bank.

18:51.560 --> 18:58.560
He told friends that he just realized that he even came to kind of

18:58.560 --> 19:03.560
view Edson's death as a result of the banking industry in some ways.

19:03.560 --> 19:08.560
Like if he hadn't been so competitive and profit hungry,

19:08.560 --> 19:09.560
maybe Edson wouldn't have died.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.560
If Edson hadn't been so profit hungry.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.560
Well, I mean, the way I've got it here is that

19:20.560 --> 19:23.560
like the endless hours, the cutthroat environment, the dubious ethics,

19:23.560 --> 19:26.560
these things hadn't caused Edson's plane to go down.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.560
But in some ways, if he squinted hard enough,

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
perhaps they'd contributed to it.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.560
Maybe he hadn't worked so hard.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.560
Maybe he hadn't worked as hard as his wife would have stayed in London.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
And Edson wouldn't have boarded that fateful flight to Rangeley.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.560
Maybe he wouldn't have owned his own plane.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.560
Maybe he would have enforced a flight commercial.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.560
Or maybe not.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.560
I like the squinting.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.560
That's good.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.560
Yeah.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.560
But Bill told acquaint...

19:44.560 --> 19:47.560
Ladies and gentlemen, that is why David is the writer.

19:47.560 --> 19:48.560
You see?

19:48.560 --> 19:50.560
If you squint it, maybe you can see this.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.560
That's good.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.560
And I'm not blowing smoke up your ass.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.560
Good.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.560
Come sit down so people can see your beautiful bald head.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.560
Yeah.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.560
So let me just do this right here.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.560
Off camera first.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.560
Yes.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
So I'll just keep going.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.560
Okay, please go ahead.

20:07.560 --> 20:10.560
So Bill, obviously not in banking anymore.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.560
Immediate priority is to help Estelle,

20:12.560 --> 20:15.560
who is, you know, not only heartbroken,

20:15.560 --> 20:18.560
but also ostracized by everyone because, you know,

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
she was the mistress.

20:20.560 --> 20:26.560
And so he, Bill, gave her some spending money,

20:26.560 --> 20:29.560
kept her busy doing odd jobs,

20:29.560 --> 20:33.560
had her fixing up the flat after it caught on fire.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.560
Fire.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

20:38.560 --> 20:44.560
Just some fond anecdotes about Bill that I think you already know.

20:44.560 --> 20:49.560
About how, like, you know, he could be a penny pincher sometimes,

20:49.560 --> 20:52.560
but he was generous when it mattered.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.560
But he was a penny pincher.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.560
Yeah.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.560
But he also, like, I'm kind of...

20:55.560 --> 20:57.560
Stop using all those paper towels.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.560
You only need one sheet of paper towel.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.560
Why are you using four sheets?

21:00.560 --> 21:01.560
What's wrong?

21:01.560 --> 21:02.560
It's like me not flushing the toilet in my...

21:02.560 --> 21:03.560
It's like, yeah.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.560
I'm shaking water.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.560
David didn't flush the toilet in his hotel room.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.560
I'm like, David, flush the toilet because I go in the bathroom.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.560
If it's...

21:09.560 --> 21:11.560
Yeah, I'm saving water, Val.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.560
I'm an environmentalist, man.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.560
I know.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.560
That's what I said.

21:16.560 --> 21:21.560
So I'm recounting the anecdote of when some Brookesman family member needed

21:21.560 --> 21:24.560
some sort of expensive medical procedure that wasn't insured,

21:24.560 --> 21:26.560
Bill offered to pay for it.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.560
And when the person resisted and said,

21:29.560 --> 21:31.560
no, I'm not going to accept your money,

21:31.560 --> 21:34.560
Bill said the person who ever was resisting was a liberal.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.560
And Bill said that if he refused to let him pay,

21:37.560 --> 21:39.560
Bill would instead donate that money to the Republican Party.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.560
That's about right, yeah.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.560
Bill was bored.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.560
Yeah.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.560
It was monotonous.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
Mm-hmm.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
He bought a dog.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
Yeah, lazy.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
Started a family foundation.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
Yeah.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.560
Went to Vegas with some college buddies.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.560
Mm-hmm.

21:55.560 --> 22:00.560
He sat around puffing his pipe and watching old movies.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.560
He sometimes joined Michael Morandy for tennis in Central Park.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
And...

22:04.560 --> 22:06.560
Turned a couple book clubs, too.

22:06.560 --> 22:11.560
Morandy could see in his friend's eyes that Bill was not very happy.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.560
No.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.560
He wrote long letters to newspaper editors that never got published.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.560
One was published.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.560
You sure about that?

22:17.560 --> 22:22.560
Yeah, yeah, there was one published in Washington.

22:22.560 --> 22:23.560
I'll show it to you.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.560
Yeah, send it to me.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.560
He went to the baths alone.

22:27.560 --> 22:28.560
Yes, yeah.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.560
And it struck up conversations with the strangers

22:30.560 --> 22:33.560
because he didn't have his best friend to go there with.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.560
And he drank a lot.

22:35.560 --> 22:38.560
And he diagnosed himself as an alcoholic.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.560
He...

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
Some friends who he went out with at the time

22:42.560 --> 22:45.560
said that he would get to a drunk that he puked the next morning.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.560
You've obviously told me a kind of similar example.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.560
Let's talk about Bob's baths already.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.560
Yeah, that was funny.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.560
Once again, some of Bill's friends...

22:53.560 --> 22:55.560
But to say you're an alcoholic because you puked...

22:55.560 --> 22:57.560
He diagnosed himself as an alcoholic.

22:57.560 --> 22:58.560
Yeah, I mean, but that's like...

22:58.560 --> 22:59.560
I'm not saying he's an alcoholic.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.560
And he didn't...

23:00.560 --> 23:02.560
At some point, everyone that's drinking too much said,

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
I'm an alcoholic.

23:03.560 --> 23:04.560
But then...

23:04.560 --> 23:05.560
As you know from your dad's notes,

23:05.560 --> 23:06.560
he viewed himself as an alcoholic.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.560
Yeah, I hate that, okay.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.560
And so did your mom.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
All right.

23:09.560 --> 23:10.560
So I'm not...

23:10.560 --> 23:12.560
Again, I'm not saying any of that in a pejorative way.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.560
Okay.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.560
Once again, some of his friends wonder if he was depressed.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.560
One of them, Saman Majd...

23:17.560 --> 23:18.560
Saman...

23:18.560 --> 23:19.560
Was...

23:19.560 --> 23:22.560
This is in emails asking about well-buttern.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.560
Yeah.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.560
And Bill says, quote,

23:24.560 --> 23:28.560
I'm not at all depressed, just very lazy and sluggish.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.560
Um...

23:31.560 --> 23:34.560
So Stan and Neil calls, lures him back to Meryl.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
Um...

23:35.560 --> 23:38.560
He comes on as a consultant.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.560
Doing lots of work.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.560
Uh...

23:41.560 --> 23:42.560
Describes his nothing too strenuous.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.560
He describes to his style, actually.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.560
He's nothing too strenuous,

23:45.560 --> 23:47.560
but it's fun to be near the game.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.560
Okay.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.560
We're not the...

23:49.560 --> 23:50.560
Uh...

23:50.560 --> 23:51.560
What year are we at?

23:51.560 --> 23:52.560
We're in...

23:52.560 --> 23:53.560
It's 2004.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.560
Um...

23:54.560 --> 23:55.560
Yeah, 2004-2005.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.560
Um...

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
Let's see...

23:57.560 --> 24:02.560
Anju, meanwhile, is climbing up the ranks.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.560
He's looking for jobs elsewhere.

24:05.560 --> 24:10.560
And then I go through a bunch of Anju's piranhas,

24:10.560 --> 24:13.560
as one person describes them.

24:13.560 --> 24:14.560
And let's see...

24:14.560 --> 24:16.560
Let's see...

24:27.560 --> 24:28.560
Okay.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
Um...

24:29.560 --> 24:33.560
2007, crisis is bubbling up.

24:33.560 --> 24:37.560
And in August, um...

24:37.560 --> 24:39.560
Actually, in that summer, Stan and Neil

24:39.560 --> 24:41.560
tries to get Bill to come on as a permanent employee.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.560
Right.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.560
And they don't.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.560
He refuses.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.560
And he just kind of shook his head sadly.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.560
And Neil said,

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
No, I'm not going to do it.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
And that was the last...

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
He didn't like his books.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.560
His derivative books.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.560
What was that?

24:54.560 --> 24:55.560
He didn't like his derivative books.

24:55.560 --> 24:56.560
He didn't like anything.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.560
He didn't feel like he was being listened to.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.560
And...

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
He felt it wasn't the same Merrill.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.560
What was that?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.560
He felt it wasn't the same Merrill Lynch.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.560
Something had gone wrong.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.560
Something had shifted.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.560
Did he say that to you?

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
Um...

25:10.560 --> 25:12.560
No, I didn't say it to me directly.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.560
I don't know if I could sort of feel it.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.560
I mean, even conversations with other people

25:17.560 --> 25:20.560
and make a piece of it together is that...

25:20.560 --> 25:23.560
You know, it's how he felt.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.560
I mean, he was always loyal to Merrill Lynch

25:25.560 --> 25:27.560
because that's what he made his mark.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.560
Yep.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.560
It was just kind of heartbreaking for him

25:29.560 --> 25:32.560
to see Merrill Lynch fail.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
Um...

25:33.560 --> 25:36.560
Okay, so that August 2007,

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
Anshu calls

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
uh, convinces Bill to come back

25:40.560 --> 25:42.560
and work as a consultant

25:42.560 --> 25:44.560
on one condition,

25:44.560 --> 25:46.560
which is that he doesn't want anyone to report to him.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.560
Anshu agrees.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.560
Um...

25:51.560 --> 25:54.560
Anshu tells someone who he's having lunch with

25:54.560 --> 25:56.560
there's one thing he learned from Edson

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
and that's when the shit hits the fan.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
There's one person you want to stand beside you

26:00.560 --> 26:01.560
and that's Bill Brooksman.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
Yeah.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.560
Um...

26:03.560 --> 26:05.560
So back they move, Bill and your mom

26:05.560 --> 26:07.560
move to London.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.560
Uh, the girls and you stay in the States.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
Um...

26:12.560 --> 26:14.560
And he starts advising Anshu

26:14.560 --> 26:18.560
on how to deal with some of the crises he's facing.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.560
One of them immediately is mortgage IT,

26:21.560 --> 26:23.560
which is this shitty mortgage company

26:23.560 --> 26:25.560
Deutsche Bank had bought the previous year

26:25.560 --> 26:28.560
like the absolute peak of the mortgage market

26:28.560 --> 26:31.560
trying to like get stuff that they could feed into

26:31.560 --> 26:33.560
the securitization and CDO machine.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
Okay.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.560
And Bill...

26:35.560 --> 26:37.560
Leverage your heavily in debt?

26:37.560 --> 26:39.560
Well, it's just like making bad mortgage loans

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
to like subprime customers basically.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.560
Is it predatory?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.560
I don't know if it's predatory.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.560
It was certainly the...

26:47.560 --> 26:49.560
It was definitely making...

26:49.560 --> 26:52.560
It was churning up very risky mortgages

26:52.560 --> 26:54.560
on kind of false pretenses

26:54.560 --> 26:57.560
and yeah, I guess predatory is probably not a

26:57.560 --> 26:59.560
bad word to describe it.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.560
Um...

27:00.560 --> 27:02.560
So he came in to manage this or to...

27:02.560 --> 27:04.560
Well, he came in to advise Anshu on it

27:04.560 --> 27:07.560
and the advice he provided was that...

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
Was this like a benchmark

27:09.560 --> 27:12.560
or a trigger warning or something for a...

27:12.560 --> 27:14.560
What's the word?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.560
It's a red flag for things to come

27:16.560 --> 27:18.560
and nobody sort of...

27:18.560 --> 27:19.560
Nobody took this as a...

27:19.560 --> 27:21.560
Well, no, I mean at this point things are going pretty bad

27:21.560 --> 27:22.560
pretty quick.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.560
Yeah, okay.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.560
We're 2007?

27:24.560 --> 27:25.560
No.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.560
Yeah, this is like fall of 2007.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.560
Okay.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.560
And keep in mind just as we're going through this,

27:31.560 --> 27:32.560
you're getting...

27:32.560 --> 27:33.560
It's a marker for things to come.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.560
Yeah, but don't think about this in such a literary way

27:35.560 --> 27:37.560
because, you know,

27:37.560 --> 27:41.560
as a genius literature writer

27:41.560 --> 27:43.560
as I am,

27:43.560 --> 27:44.560
you're not...

27:44.560 --> 27:45.560
Yes.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.560
Articulate too.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.560
Well done.

27:47.560 --> 27:48.560
Yes.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.560
You're not getting like...

27:49.560 --> 27:50.560
I know.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.560
You're not getting a feel for it

27:51.560 --> 27:52.560
because I'm jumping around.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.560
Sure.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.560
And these otherwise will be here.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.560
Yeah, I'm just curious if you're using this

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
as like a marker for what's going on.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
No, I'm using this actually as an indication

28:02.560 --> 28:04.560
of a real, like,

28:04.560 --> 28:06.560
weighing in on something in a very practical way.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.560
And basically this business

28:08.560 --> 28:10.560
that they had just spent half a billion dollars

28:10.560 --> 28:11.560
on months earlier

28:11.560 --> 28:13.560
is now, according to Bill, worthless.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.560
Like literally not worth anything.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.560
And so what do you do with that?

28:16.560 --> 28:17.560
One option is,

28:17.560 --> 28:18.560
at the end of the year,

28:18.560 --> 28:19.560
you write it off entirely

28:19.560 --> 28:21.560
and acknowledge it's worth zero.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.560
But that means you have to take a huge loss

28:24.560 --> 28:25.560
and account on the loss anyway.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.560
That would mean you've recognized

28:27.560 --> 28:29.560
and you basically take...

28:29.560 --> 28:30.560
Whatever you spent on it,

28:30.560 --> 28:31.560
you're taking that as a loss now.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.560
If it's really worth zero.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.560
In addition to being bad financially,

28:34.560 --> 28:36.560
this is like really embarrassing.

28:36.560 --> 28:37.560
Sure.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.560
So Bill comes up with a different solution,

28:39.560 --> 28:43.560
which is that it can basically hover in place

28:43.560 --> 28:46.560
and not do any more risky loans,

28:46.560 --> 28:47.560
only do good loans,

28:47.560 --> 28:51.560
and that will kind of allow them to be able

28:51.560 --> 28:54.560
to move forward without actually acknowledging

28:54.560 --> 28:55.560
how bad their investment was.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.560
So it's kind of a graceful way.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.560
I mean, saying it's kind of paper things over,

29:00.560 --> 29:02.560
but not in like a bad way.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.560
It's just like...

29:05.560 --> 29:08.560
So he comes back full-time in 2008.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.560
He's got his obscure title,

29:10.560 --> 29:12.560
which is head of capital and risk optimization

29:12.560 --> 29:14.560
for the investment bank.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.560
And so despite the obscure title,

29:17.560 --> 29:18.560
you know, everyone knew

29:18.560 --> 29:19.560
if he reported directly to Anshu,

29:19.560 --> 29:23.560
and Anshu like deeply valued his opinion.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.560
And Anshu could show that

29:25.560 --> 29:26.560
for all the cowboys we have,

29:26.560 --> 29:27.560
we also have Bill,

29:27.560 --> 29:34.560
the former colleague said.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.560
He starts up weekly risk management meetings,

29:37.560 --> 29:38.560
which hadn't existed.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.560
He starts like really just like looking

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
around these businesses,

29:42.560 --> 29:44.560
looking, trying to understand them.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.560
And, you know, seeing a lot of problems

29:47.560 --> 29:49.560
and trying to slowly but surely clean them up.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.560
And this is right as the financial crisis

29:52.560 --> 29:54.560
is hitting in Deutsche Bank,

29:54.560 --> 29:56.560
as you probably know,

29:56.560 --> 29:58.560
is actually a big winner in the crisis,

29:58.560 --> 30:01.560
partly because they had, you know,

30:01.560 --> 30:04.560
they were shorting.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
There's some short all these CDOs,

30:06.560 --> 30:08.560
which they had actually helped manufacture.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.560
And so they were,

30:10.560 --> 30:12.560
and playing both sides of this,

30:12.560 --> 30:14.560
and it was very profitable for them.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.560
And that came from that Deutsche Bank guy

30:16.560 --> 30:18.560
that made quite a good...

30:18.560 --> 30:19.560
Yeah.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.560
So Greg Lippmann is who you're thinking of,

30:21.560 --> 30:23.560
who was kind of immortalized in the Big Short.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.560
You're in Big Short.

30:26.560 --> 30:27.560
Okay.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.560
Okay, we're just going to pause this for a sec and...

30:55.560 --> 30:56.560
Okay.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.560
Are you feeling tired?

31:03.560 --> 31:04.560
I'm feeling good.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
I mean, this is weird.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
Yeah.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
So much.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.560
So cool.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.560
It's intense.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.560
Yeah, it's intense.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.560
And it's like...

31:16.560 --> 31:18.560
Because you kind of have to go

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
open everything down.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.560
Yeah.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.560
And also, like...

31:25.560 --> 31:27.560
I mean, I'm telling you everything,

31:27.560 --> 31:29.560
but I'm also trying to, like...

31:30.560 --> 31:32.560
Be nice to us and this stuff.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.560
Not really.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.560
I'm just telling you, I just...

31:35.560 --> 31:37.560
I don't want to let you hear this from anyone else.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.560
Yeah, but...

31:42.560 --> 31:43.560
For sure.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.560
That's...

31:44.560 --> 31:46.560
That's a very good way.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.560
It'll be worse.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.560
Absolutely.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.560
That's why I'm doing this.

31:51.560 --> 31:52.560
Yeah.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.560
It's just...

31:53.560 --> 31:55.560
The point being, not that I'm not telling you.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.560
It's intense.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.560
And I'm just...

31:58.560 --> 31:59.560
I'm aware of it.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.560
I'm aware of it.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.560
I'm aware of it.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.560
And also, cognizant of that...

32:04.560 --> 32:06.560
What is on my computer screen right now?

32:06.560 --> 32:07.560
It's an obvious...

32:07.560 --> 32:11.560
The book is going to go through a zillion revisions

32:11.560 --> 32:14.560
and changes and edits and restructures

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
and things like that.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.560
So this is all...

32:16.560 --> 32:18.560
It's all in flux, you know?

32:18.560 --> 32:21.560
And so he's hearing it now.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
You're hearing it now.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.560
Sorry?

32:23.560 --> 32:24.560
Yeah, let's see.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.560
You ready?

32:27.560 --> 32:28.560
Actually, you know what?

32:28.560 --> 32:31.560
I'm going to drop this with a scoop of steamer.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.560
Greg Lippmann.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.560
Greg Lippmann.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.560
Something Lippmann.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.560
Yeah, so Deutsche Bank was creating these CDOs

32:42.560 --> 32:44.560
and short-selling their own...

32:44.560 --> 32:45.560
their own CDOs.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.560
Did you pull that thing?

32:51.560 --> 32:52.560
Yeah.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.560
So they were creating packaging CDOs

33:09.560 --> 33:11.560
and short-selling them?

33:13.560 --> 33:15.560
So this is where Fred DePaul's loft came in.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.560
They would use...

33:17.560 --> 33:21.560
So you take...

33:21.560 --> 33:25.560
So do you want me to just explain this as if you're an idiot?

33:25.560 --> 33:26.560
Yeah, absolutely.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.560
Yeah.

33:27.560 --> 33:28.560
Yeah.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.560
So...

33:31.560 --> 33:32.560
Okay, so you take a mortgage.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.560
Right.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.560
Take a bunch of it, which is...

33:34.560 --> 33:35.560
Right.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.560
Package that together into a mortgage security.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.560
Sure.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.560
You then take a bunch of mortgage securities.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.560
Right.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.560
Mush them together and then like shop them up

33:43.560 --> 33:44.560
depending on their risk.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.560
Conscious.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.560
Yeah, very good.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.560
Conscious.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.560
I told you I was going to tell you like you're an idiot

33:49.560 --> 33:50.560
even though you're not an idiot.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.560
So the...

33:52.560 --> 33:54.560
And those are CDOs, right?

33:54.560 --> 33:55.560
Right.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.560
You then use credit default swaps.

33:57.560 --> 34:01.560
CDS, which are insurance contracts essentially

34:01.560 --> 34:02.560
to bet against those CDOs.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.560
Right.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.560
And so Deutsche Bank on the one hand

34:05.560 --> 34:07.560
was taking all these mortgages,

34:07.560 --> 34:09.560
some of which they were producing through mortgage IT

34:09.560 --> 34:10.560
that's coming from what they bought.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.560
Oh, okay.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.560
Packaging those into mortgage-backed securities,

34:14.560 --> 34:18.560
into CDOs, which Greg Lipman's squad was selling

34:18.560 --> 34:20.560
to dummies all over the world.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.560
Right.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.560
And then simultaneously betting against those very CDOs.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.560
Which is the short sell.

34:25.560 --> 34:26.560
Which is the short sell.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.560
So they not only are both selling something bad

34:30.560 --> 34:32.560
and betting that they're going to fail,

34:32.560 --> 34:34.560
but they also kind of have inside knowledge

34:34.560 --> 34:36.560
of what's going to do well and what's not going to do well

34:36.560 --> 34:37.560
because they're fucking mortgages.

34:37.560 --> 34:38.560
Sure.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.560
So...

34:39.560 --> 34:40.560
Yeah.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.560
Well, they not only packed them, they originated them.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.560
They were, because of mortgage IT,

34:44.560 --> 34:46.560
they're actually producing these mortgages

34:46.560 --> 34:48.560
because they know every step of the process.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.560
I didn't realize that mortgage IT was the conduit.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.560
Well, it was just part of it.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.560
I mean, I didn't even actually realize that myself

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
until recently when I was going through

34:57.560 --> 35:00.560
the huge settlement they had, Deutsche Bank had,

35:00.560 --> 35:03.560
which was last year or the year before last.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.560
And it goes, the Justice Department itself,

35:06.560 --> 35:08.560
just goes in great detail to the role,

35:08.560 --> 35:11.560
the fraudulent role that mortgage IT played.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.560
And so, well, we'll get to this later,

35:14.560 --> 35:17.560
but that's one of the things,

35:17.560 --> 35:19.560
I don't know this, I'm just speculating,

35:19.560 --> 35:21.560
but it's possible that your dad,

35:21.560 --> 35:24.560
given the advice that he had given to Anchu

35:24.560 --> 35:25.560
about that business and saying,

35:25.560 --> 35:27.560
don't shut it down, keep it going

35:27.560 --> 35:29.560
so we don't need to recognize that big loss.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.560
It's not impossible that that was

35:32.560 --> 35:35.560
like a little bit bothersome to people.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.560
Right.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.560
I don't know that, though, that's just pure speculation.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.560
So, okay, crisis ends.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.560
To not bring mortgage IT to light

35:43.560 --> 35:45.560
or to sort of give mortgage IT to the past?

35:45.560 --> 35:47.560
No, it gave it a, yeah, to give it a pass.

35:47.560 --> 35:48.560
They gave it like another lease on life.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.560
They allowed it to continue operating for a while.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.560
Again, I'm not making much of that

35:53.560 --> 35:55.560
because I don't really know, but it's...

35:55.560 --> 35:56.560
That's an interesting idea.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.560
I mean, with the benefit of hindsight,

35:58.560 --> 36:00.560
that wasn't the best plan.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.560
Right.

36:01.560 --> 36:05.560
What they came up with, hindsight's 20-20.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.560
Okay, so this is where, starting around 2010,

36:08.560 --> 36:12.560
Deutsche Bank, it's big decline begins.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.560
So, it survived the crisis better than most

36:14.560 --> 36:16.560
because Greg Litman and his ilk

36:16.560 --> 36:18.560
were making billions of dollars

36:18.560 --> 36:20.560
short in the mortgage market.

36:20.560 --> 36:24.560
And Deutsche Bank executives,

36:24.560 --> 36:27.560
primarily Anchu and Joe Ackerman,

36:27.560 --> 36:32.560
mistook their relative success during the crisis

36:32.560 --> 36:34.560
as a sign that they were just in the clear.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.560
And they step on the gas.

36:37.560 --> 36:40.560
And Anchu is kind of losing touch with reality.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.560
It seems like according to a bunch of people

36:42.560 --> 36:43.560
who worked with him.

36:43.560 --> 36:47.560
And also, they are...

36:47.560 --> 36:50.560
The so-called piranhas around Anchu

36:50.560 --> 36:52.560
are, no one is paying any attention to them.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.560
So, that includes Christian Bittar,

36:55.560 --> 36:58.560
who is the LIBOR trader.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.560
It includes...

37:00.560 --> 37:02.560
Call him, can I...

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
Be patient.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.560
It includes the tax trades that they were doing

37:06.560 --> 37:07.560
for renaissance.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.560
The basket options.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.560
The basket options are good.

37:10.560 --> 37:16.560
And it includes...

37:16.560 --> 37:20.560
It includes Monty Deposky.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.560
And Kelly Faisola.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.560
Good.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.560
And yeah, it includes these crazed trading floors

37:26.560 --> 37:28.560
that Colin Fan is presiding over.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.560
So, here's one thing.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.560
This is one of the most interesting things

37:31.560 --> 37:36.560
I think I've found in my reporting.

37:36.560 --> 37:39.560
It's just an anecdote, but it's a telling one.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.560
So, in...

37:41.560 --> 37:44.560
I'm trying to figure out exactly the date here.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.560
I think 2010.

37:47.560 --> 37:52.560
Let's give it a take, 2010.

37:52.560 --> 37:56.560
There was a trader, a whole group of traders, actually,

37:56.560 --> 37:59.560
in their bond traders.

37:59.560 --> 38:03.560
And they were trading on mortgages.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.560
But this was after the crisis.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
So, they were actually betting,

38:05.560 --> 38:07.560
whereas Deutsche Bank had made this big short bet

38:07.560 --> 38:08.560
against the housing market.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.560
The exposition?

38:09.560 --> 38:11.560
This was the opposite.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.560
So, they were now betting on the housing market

38:13.560 --> 38:14.560
to recover.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.560
And this guy's name is Troy Dixon.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.560
He's like a young guy.

38:18.560 --> 38:22.560
And it had a whole group that they were making

38:22.560 --> 38:25.560
a very big, like multi-billion dollar bet

38:25.560 --> 38:28.560
the housing market was going to come back to life

38:28.560 --> 38:31.560
in a big way, which is fine.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.560
But the bets were really, really big.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.560
And so, risk managers started getting very worried.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.560
How big?

38:37.560 --> 38:40.560
Billions.

38:40.560 --> 38:44.560
And the risk management team in the investment bank

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
didn't have anywhere to go.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.560
No one would listen to their concerns.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.560
So, they went to your dad.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.560
And Bill took a look at...

38:50.560 --> 38:52.560
The risk guys had basically compiled a dossier

38:52.560 --> 38:53.560
of all this stuff.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.560
And so, Bill started going through the dossier

38:55.560 --> 38:57.560
and agreed that what they were showing

38:57.560 --> 38:59.560
him did not look good.

38:59.560 --> 39:02.560
It looked like this is just like a gigantic risk.

39:02.560 --> 39:06.560
So, he went to talk to Troy Dixon's group.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.560
And Dixon was like, fuck you old man.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.560
I'm not going to...

39:10.560 --> 39:12.560
Like, who are you?

39:12.560 --> 39:16.560
And this went back and forth.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.560
They fought.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.560
Bill went back to the risk managers and said

39:20.560 --> 39:22.560
he'd receive a strong pushback, that's a quote,

39:22.560 --> 39:26.560
from above in the efforts to rein Dixon in.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
Dixon kept...

39:27.560 --> 39:29.560
Or Bill kept pushing.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.560
Dixon kept getting angry.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.560
And without any success, Bill did not manage to corral.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.560
And he could tell that he was pissing Troy Dixon off.

39:37.560 --> 39:38.560
Pissing off his whole group.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.560
And so, he tried to patch those up.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.560
And he invited Dixon and about 10 other traders

39:43.560 --> 39:45.560
from that desk out to dinner.

39:45.560 --> 39:48.560
It was an Italian restaurant in Tribeca.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.560
Large candlelit table.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.560
Floral tapestries on the wall.

39:52.560 --> 39:53.560
Okay.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.560
So, you went there?

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
Yeah.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.560
So, dinner gets off to an awkward start.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.560
And Bill and Troy are still bickering about the wisdom

40:02.560 --> 40:03.560
of these trades.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.560
And neither of them would drop.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.560
And Dixon's crew, it's a little posse,

40:07.560 --> 40:09.560
is around the hill like kind of snickering at your dad.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.560
Snickering at my dad.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.560
Snickering.

40:11.560 --> 40:12.560
That he's out of his depth.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
He doesn't understand this stuff.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.560
Which is crazy.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.560
Does your father is out of his depth?

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
They don't know who...

40:17.560 --> 40:19.560
He wasn't out of their depth.

40:19.560 --> 40:21.560
These guys are like young, obnoxious.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.560
Yeah, they thought right down.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.560
They thought they were laughing at him.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.560
They were starting to.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.560
Anyway, they stopped talking about this trades

40:27.560 --> 40:28.560
and there's a conversation with me,

40:28.560 --> 40:29.560
and there's something else.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.560
And I don't know.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.560
I think I'm going to be asking you at one point.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.560
Do you know who Jerry Sundusky is?

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
Did I ask you that?

40:34.560 --> 40:36.560
Yeah, it's the guy that was molesting people

40:36.560 --> 40:37.560
in the showers or something.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.560
He was a former college,

40:38.560 --> 40:40.560
Penn College football coach.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.560
Yeah.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.560
Or Penn State College football coach.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.560
Yeah.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.560
Or he knew about the other guy.

40:45.560 --> 40:46.560
Right?

40:46.560 --> 40:47.560
There wasn't a documentary.

40:47.560 --> 40:50.560
Yeah, no, that's Joe Paterno.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.560
He's the guy who...

40:52.560 --> 40:53.560
Now, how is this relevant?

40:53.560 --> 40:54.560
You'll see.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.560
Oh, right, because you didn't know who he was.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.560
Maybe I've told you some of this before.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.560
Yeah, and I was texting him for a long time

41:02.560 --> 41:03.560
trying to say,

41:03.560 --> 41:05.560
well, I didn't even know who the guy was

41:05.560 --> 41:06.560
until he heard his name.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.560
Yeah, it's fair enough.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.560
Bill had never heard of the guy.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.560
He had just write them a sentence

41:10.560 --> 41:11.560
to at least 30 years in prison

41:11.560 --> 41:12.560
for child molestation.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.560
And someone at the table remarked that

41:16.560 --> 41:19.560
child molesters in for a tough time in prison.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.560
And your dad said,

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
why?

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
And the traitors looked at each other.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.560
This dude for real.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.560
And someone says,

41:27.560 --> 41:30.560
finally, you see molested boys.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.560
So?

41:31.560 --> 41:32.560
Why?

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
Why is that reason for a tough time?

41:34.560 --> 41:37.560
And Bill did not get that child molesters

41:37.560 --> 41:40.560
were like the most hated people in prison.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.560
This is like fair enough.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.560
Kept asking questions.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.560
Okay.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.560
Why?

41:44.560 --> 41:45.560
Why?

41:45.560 --> 41:46.560
Why?

41:46.560 --> 41:48.560
And once again, the snickering starts up.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.560
They're just fucking laughing at him.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.560
One of them described it as this old man was clueless.

41:53.560 --> 41:54.560
Okay.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.560
Uh, end of the meal.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.560
Bill picks up the tab and just bolts.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.560
He's like, doesn't even really say goodbye.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.560
He just heads straight for the subway.

42:03.560 --> 42:07.560
And Troy Dixon and his buddies go back to the bar,

42:07.560 --> 42:08.560
go back to a bar,

42:08.560 --> 42:10.560
and they just spend the night laughing

42:10.560 --> 42:12.560
about how this weird guy,

42:12.560 --> 42:15.560
like didn't know that Jerry Sandusky doesn't understand prison.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.560
And then they went back to work.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.560
Fuck these guys.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.560
Fuck these guys.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.560
What were they?

42:20.560 --> 42:21.560
Who cares?

42:21.560 --> 42:22.560
Well, they were...

42:22.560 --> 42:23.560
They were wrong anyway.

42:23.560 --> 42:24.560
My dad was right.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.560
This is...

42:25.560 --> 42:27.560
And he cares if you didn't fucking Jerry Sandusky.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.560
I didn't know who he was either.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.560
And my dad isn't really up to what's going on in the prison world.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.560
But I'm pretty sure he was trying to figure out

42:33.560 --> 42:34.560
why they're talking about this.

42:34.560 --> 42:37.560
I mean, I'm sure if he said to my dad,

42:37.560 --> 42:38.560
at any point in time,

42:38.560 --> 42:41.560
a child molester would have trouble in prison,

42:41.560 --> 42:42.560
he would understand that.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.560
That's not something that was over his head.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.560
But at this, probably the context of this meeting,

42:47.560 --> 42:49.560
if this is true what they say,

42:49.560 --> 42:50.560
he could be either,

42:50.560 --> 42:51.560
he's trying to fuck with them

42:51.560 --> 42:52.560
or get a read on them,

42:52.560 --> 42:54.560
saying why, why, why, over and over

42:54.560 --> 42:58.560
to see how deeply, deeply moronic these people are

42:58.560 --> 43:00.560
to continue this line of questioning,

43:00.560 --> 43:03.560
to see why he would perceive them to be...

43:03.560 --> 43:05.560
Their responses to his why

43:05.560 --> 43:07.560
is how he reads other people.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.560
My dad was here in the room.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.560
And he says,

43:10.560 --> 43:11.560
my dad was here in the room

43:11.560 --> 43:12.560
and he says,

43:12.560 --> 43:14.560
why do you want quite an obvious question?

43:14.560 --> 43:16.560
He's got to get a read on you.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.560
He's not actually asking why.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.560
Like, the sky's blue, why?

43:20.560 --> 43:22.560
He's trying to figure out how you perceive it

43:22.560 --> 43:23.560
and what you're...

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
He's trying to get some time

43:24.560 --> 43:26.560
to make up his mind about you

43:26.560 --> 43:28.560
and he's giving you something to talk about.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.560
I think he's pretty much made up his mind

43:30.560 --> 43:32.560
before he went out to dinner with these guys.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.560
He did not like them.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.560
And I'm not sure that was bad on his part.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.560
There's very...

43:37.560 --> 43:38.560
My read on this, though,

43:38.560 --> 43:41.560
is just putting aside what Bill's intent was.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.560
The reality is that these...

43:44.560 --> 43:46.560
It was like a generational shift

43:46.560 --> 43:47.560
going on in Wall Street

43:47.560 --> 43:48.560
and the guys who had grown up

43:48.560 --> 43:51.560
viewing derivatives as casino instruments

43:51.560 --> 43:53.560
were on the rise

43:53.560 --> 43:56.560
and guys like Bill who had grown up

43:56.560 --> 43:58.560
viewing them primarily as hedging devices

43:58.560 --> 44:00.560
and client-centric devices

44:00.560 --> 44:01.560
were on the way out

44:01.560 --> 44:05.560
and the young guys didn't have any respect

44:05.560 --> 44:07.560
for the slightly older guys.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.560
That makes sense.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.560
But in the anecdote,

44:09.560 --> 44:12.560
it seems like the takeaway from it

44:12.560 --> 44:15.560
is that my dad was out of touch.

44:15.560 --> 44:16.560
No, that's not...

44:16.560 --> 44:17.560
Because if you're saying,

44:17.560 --> 44:18.560
why, why, why...

44:18.560 --> 44:19.560
Trust me, Val, that's not...

44:19.560 --> 44:20.560
Maybe I'm...

44:20.560 --> 44:23.560
Well, this is just the danger of doing it this way.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.560
If I read it, I'm sure...

44:25.560 --> 44:28.560
This is kind of a sad moment for Bill.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.560
Like, there's...

44:30.560 --> 44:31.560
Why?

44:31.560 --> 44:33.560
Because you think he's realizing he's out of touch?

44:33.560 --> 44:36.560
He's realizing that there's been a generational shift.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
But there's a paradox here

44:37.560 --> 44:39.560
because yes, he's maybe out of touch

44:39.560 --> 44:41.560
with what's going on in current events,

44:41.560 --> 44:43.560
but he's obviously very much in touch

44:43.560 --> 44:45.560
because he's trying to rein in these idiots

44:45.560 --> 44:47.560
to stop doing something different.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.560
Dixon's trades blow up,

44:50.560 --> 44:53.560
cost Deutsche Bank half a billion dollars,

44:53.560 --> 44:55.560
and federal regulators start investigating.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.560
So that was totally right.

44:57.560 --> 44:58.560
He has the last laugh,

44:58.560 --> 45:00.560
but it's just not a very funny laugh

45:00.560 --> 45:03.560
because people aren't listening.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.560
And this is a pattern that's about to repeat itself

45:05.560 --> 45:06.560
over and over and over again.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.560
Because people stop listening to him.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.560
To this old man from a different era.

45:11.560 --> 45:13.560
That makes sense.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.560
So you think he felt he was out of touch

45:24.560 --> 45:26.560
and he didn't know how to rein in these fools?

45:26.560 --> 45:27.560
He didn't know how to rein them in,

45:27.560 --> 45:29.560
just no one would listen to him.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.560
But he didn't have the backing necessary?

45:31.560 --> 45:34.560
I mean, but he had the power of Deutsche Bank behind him.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.560
How could they not rein in Troy Dixon

45:36.560 --> 45:39.560
and his crew of fucking morons?

45:40.560 --> 45:41.560
They weren't morons.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.560
They were just making a very big, risky bet.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.560
It sounded pretty moronic to me.

45:48.560 --> 45:53.560
So, one of the lessons here

45:53.560 --> 45:55.560
that I've picked up on...

45:55.560 --> 45:58.560
Sorry, I'm just upset someone's fucking with my dad.

45:58.560 --> 45:59.560
No, I get it, man.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.560
And that's the direction you're supposed to have.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.560
It's a reader you're supposed to have.

46:03.560 --> 46:04.560
Yeah.

46:04.560 --> 46:07.560
They're being...

46:07.560 --> 46:08.560
Where you going?

46:08.560 --> 46:10.560
I'm just going to put this to charge

46:10.560 --> 46:12.560
and have a proper cigarette.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.560
One of the big takeaways I have

46:18.560 --> 46:20.560
about your dad and his role as a bank

46:20.560 --> 46:22.560
is that your dad is like a good man.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.560
He's an honest man,

46:24.560 --> 46:26.560
makes mistakes like we all do,

46:26.560 --> 46:28.560
but he's a good human being.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.560
But one of the things that

46:32.560 --> 46:34.560
there's no way it was not bothering him

46:34.560 --> 46:37.560
is that his role was changed.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.560
With Edson, he was like the right-hand man

46:39.560 --> 46:42.560
who was just

46:42.560 --> 46:45.560
an integral part of the kind of ecosystem,

46:45.560 --> 46:46.560
the functioning.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.560
He was the super ego to Edson's id.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.560
In the second round at Deutsche Bank,

46:52.560 --> 46:53.560
he's not bad.

46:53.560 --> 46:56.560
There is no need for a super ego.

46:56.560 --> 46:57.560
This bank is out of control.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.560
Nobody's listening to him.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.560
And there is...

47:01.560 --> 47:03.560
No one wants to hear bad news anymore.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.560
No one wants someone to say no.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.560
They think they're so smart.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.560
They just surfed through the financial crisis.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.560
The greatest disruption since the 1920's

47:11.560 --> 47:13.560
or 1930's.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.560
They don't need

47:15.560 --> 47:16.560
Dr. Nell.

47:16.560 --> 47:17.560
Right.

47:17.560 --> 47:18.560
Okay.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.560
Anchi becomes CEO.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.560
Okay.

47:23.560 --> 47:24.560
In 2012.

47:24.560 --> 47:25.560
Co-CEO.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.560
So the hubris has taken over.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.560
The hubris has taken over.

47:29.560 --> 47:30.560
Okay.

47:30.560 --> 47:31.560
Okay.

47:33.560 --> 47:35.560
Anchi is one of his main priorities.

47:35.560 --> 47:36.560
It's because they got lucky.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.560
They thought they were smarter than everyone else.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.560
One of the chapters right now is titled

47:40.560 --> 47:42.560
Luck vs. Skill.

47:43.560 --> 47:44.560
Hey.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.560
Good.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.560
I just predicted that.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.560
Interesting.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.560
Okay.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.560
Or there while you just directed me toward that.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.560
Interesting.

47:51.560 --> 47:52.560
Did I just say that was...

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
We got that on camera.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.560
I just said

47:55.560 --> 47:58.560
without knowing anything about what he was saying

47:58.560 --> 48:00.560
that this bank was lucky

48:00.560 --> 48:02.560
but they thought that they were smarter than everyone else.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.560
David said the next title of the chapter

48:04.560 --> 48:06.560
is Luck vs. Skill.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.560
So that's good.

48:07.560 --> 48:08.560
So as a reader

48:08.560 --> 48:09.560
this is good.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.560
It's interesting.

48:10.560 --> 48:12.560
I just want to point that out.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.560
We got it.

48:14.560 --> 48:15.560
Saved your posterity on that.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.560
Yeah.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.560
On my iPhone.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.560
Interesting.

48:18.560 --> 48:19.560
Okay.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.560
So here comes an incident that

48:21.560 --> 48:22.560
you know a bit about

48:22.560 --> 48:24.560
but I think you'll learn a little bit more.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.560
So Anchi

48:26.560 --> 48:28.560
takes over as CEO

48:28.560 --> 48:31.560
and wants to fill the place with his loyalists.

48:31.560 --> 48:32.560
Right.

48:32.560 --> 48:33.560
Your dad is a loyalist

48:33.560 --> 48:35.560
or at least that's how he comes to perceive some.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.560
And so he puts your dad up

48:37.560 --> 48:39.560
for the job of chief risk officer.

48:41.560 --> 48:43.560
And he tells Bill

48:43.560 --> 48:45.560
that it's a perfect fit.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.560
Like he gets risk management better than anyone else

48:47.560 --> 48:48.560
on to trust him.

48:48.560 --> 48:50.560
And it's like a big leap up.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.560
He'll go on the Vorstand

48:52.560 --> 48:53.560
which is the management committee

48:53.560 --> 48:54.560
which is like this

48:54.560 --> 48:56.560
rarefied board that previously

48:56.560 --> 48:58.560
had been off-limits to anyone who wasn't German.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.560
And it's a big jump up.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.560
His friends congratulate him.

49:07.560 --> 49:08.560
He and Michael Morandi

49:08.560 --> 49:09.560
are just like weird joke

49:09.560 --> 49:12.560
where Morandi is called monkey business.

49:12.560 --> 49:13.560
Okay.

49:13.560 --> 49:14.560
Which is Moran,

49:14.560 --> 49:16.560
they would like go out to dinner together

49:16.560 --> 49:18.560
and like clumsily hit on waitresses

49:18.560 --> 49:19.560
and whoever other,

49:19.560 --> 49:20.560
whatever other women were around

49:20.560 --> 49:21.560
and like,

49:21.560 --> 49:22.560
not they're going to do anything

49:22.560 --> 49:23.560
but just like,

49:23.560 --> 49:24.560
he's been around.

49:24.560 --> 49:25.560
And so Morandi,

49:25.560 --> 49:26.560
when he learned that Bill

49:26.560 --> 49:28.560
has been put up for this very important job,

49:28.560 --> 49:31.560
laments that there will be no more monkey business.

49:32.560 --> 49:33.560
And Deutsche Bank,

49:33.560 --> 49:34.560
after announcing this to the world,

49:34.560 --> 49:36.560
decides that maybe it would be a good idea

49:36.560 --> 49:37.560
to check with the German regulators,

49:37.560 --> 49:38.560
Bafen,

49:38.560 --> 49:40.560
over whether this is okay.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.560
Because Bafen actually has veto power over this.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.560
Okay.

49:43.560 --> 49:44.560
And Bafen's students over this

49:44.560 --> 49:45.560
for a little while.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.560
Who says to suggest Bafen?

49:47.560 --> 49:50.560
Deutsche Bank has to submit this

49:50.560 --> 49:51.560
to Bafen's approval.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.560
They have to.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.560
The reasons that remain unclear,

49:54.560 --> 49:57.560
they decided it would be smart to announce the job

49:57.560 --> 49:58.560
before they'd actually sought

49:58.560 --> 50:00.560
or received approval from the regulators.

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
Okay.

50:01.560 --> 50:02.560
Not smart.

50:02.560 --> 50:03.560
No.

50:03.560 --> 50:06.560
Bafen already was very troubled but on to

50:06.560 --> 50:10.560
and concerned about his recklessness

50:10.560 --> 50:12.560
and his lack of management savvy

50:12.560 --> 50:17.560
and perceived on to as putting into

50:17.560 --> 50:19.560
arguably the most important job in the bank,

50:19.560 --> 50:20.560
Chief Risk Officer,

50:20.560 --> 50:23.560
one of his kind of flak flunkies.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.560
So they consider my dad a flunky to answer?

50:25.560 --> 50:26.560
Yes.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.560
They perceive that way.

50:27.560 --> 50:28.560
What about Ackerman?

50:28.560 --> 50:30.560
Well, Ackerman's gone at this point.

50:30.560 --> 50:31.560
Oh.

50:31.560 --> 50:32.560
He stepped down.

50:32.560 --> 50:33.560
So, in fact,

50:33.560 --> 50:35.560
Bill wonders to his friend,

50:35.560 --> 50:36.560
so Bafen rejects it.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.560
It's a very embarrassing situation for him.

50:38.560 --> 50:39.560
He's been given this big promotion.

50:39.560 --> 50:41.560
Wait, we're in 2012.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.560
In 2012.

50:42.560 --> 50:43.560
Okay.

50:43.560 --> 50:44.560
He gets this big promotion,

50:44.560 --> 50:45.560
huge promotion.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.560
It's all like newspapers write stories about it.

50:47.560 --> 50:48.560
The FT did a lot on it.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.560
They write the journal too.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.560
And then it gets rescinded.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.560
Right.

50:52.560 --> 50:54.560
And so Bill wonders to his friends and colleagues

50:54.560 --> 50:56.560
that he speculates that perhaps he was just

50:56.560 --> 50:57.560
a victim of sabotage.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.560
And maybe Ackerman had basically

51:01.560 --> 51:03.560
stabbed him in the back with the regulators

51:03.560 --> 51:04.560
because he wanted,

51:04.560 --> 51:06.560
Ackerman wanted to hurt Anshu.

51:06.560 --> 51:09.560
In any case,

51:09.560 --> 51:11.560
he'd been receiving all these congrats

51:11.560 --> 51:13.560
and throwing emails and phone calls all month

51:13.560 --> 51:16.560
and now he has to go back to people over and over

51:16.560 --> 51:18.560
and explain that the job has been revoked.

51:18.560 --> 51:19.560
Okay.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.560
Easy come, easy go,

51:21.560 --> 51:23.560
was the voicemail he left for his mother.

51:26.560 --> 51:27.560
And he sounds nonchalant,

51:27.560 --> 51:29.560
but when Pete, his brother,

51:29.560 --> 51:30.560
listens...

51:30.560 --> 51:31.560
Peter.

51:31.560 --> 51:32.560
I call him Peter.

51:32.560 --> 51:33.560
It's Peter.

51:33.560 --> 51:34.560
No one calls him Peter.

51:34.560 --> 51:35.560
It's written Peter.

51:35.560 --> 51:36.560
I'm just reading with notches.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.560
Okay.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.560
When Peter listens to the message,

51:40.560 --> 51:42.560
you can tell that he says

51:42.560 --> 51:44.560
there's no concealing the hurt in his voice.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.560
Really?

51:46.560 --> 51:48.560
I don't know.

51:48.560 --> 51:49.560
I remember he told me.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.560
It didn't seem...

51:51.560 --> 51:52.560
I don't think that is what he told you.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.560
We'll get to that in a second.

51:53.560 --> 51:54.560
Oh.

51:54.560 --> 51:55.560
I mean, when he told me,

51:55.560 --> 51:56.560
I didn't take up any...

51:56.560 --> 51:57.560
Well, he didn't...

51:57.560 --> 51:58.560
We'll get to it.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.560
He told you an email.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.560
Sorry?

52:00.560 --> 52:02.560
He told you in an email how he felt.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.560
So we'll get to that in a second.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.560
No, he told me over dinner.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.560
We'll get to it in a second.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.560
I'll read it to you.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.560
He told Sam

52:10.560 --> 52:13.560
that he felt insulted.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.560
He told John Bright

52:14.560 --> 52:17.560
the particle physicist from Merrill

52:17.560 --> 52:20.560
that he knew he should be relieved.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.560
But once I quote...

52:22.560 --> 52:23.560
But once I started thinking about the job,

52:23.560 --> 52:25.560
I liked it.

52:25.560 --> 52:26.560
Miranda joked,

52:26.560 --> 52:28.560
we're back in the monkey business.

52:28.560 --> 52:31.560
Bill laughed and looked sad.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.560
And then, at the end of the year,

52:33.560 --> 52:35.560
this pattern defeated itself

52:35.560 --> 52:37.560
because Bill was put up for another senior job

52:37.560 --> 52:39.560
running the non-core unit at Deutsche Bank.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.560
And once again,

52:40.560 --> 52:43.560
Boppen shot it down after it had been announced.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.560
So this is around the time that Bill,

52:46.560 --> 52:47.560
as a consolation prize,

52:47.560 --> 52:49.560
gets put on DBTCA's board.

52:53.560 --> 52:56.560
So we've got a bunch of DBTCA history here.

52:56.560 --> 52:59.560
And he felt he was being set up now at this point.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.560
He didn't really feel he was being set up.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.560
He felt like he needed to...

53:03.560 --> 53:06.560
There was some concern over him feeling set up

53:06.560 --> 53:08.560
for what was about to happen at Deutsche Bank

53:08.560 --> 53:10.560
according to the therapist.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.560
I don't think that's quite right.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
There's to be a fall guy, in a sense.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.560
I think he...

53:16.560 --> 53:18.560
Because he saw what was coming.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.560
I don't think he saw what was coming.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.560
I think he viewed...

53:22.560 --> 53:25.560
What do you mean there's the DOJ investigations?

53:25.560 --> 53:27.560
We'll get there. Don't worry. I promise you.

53:27.560 --> 53:30.560
There's a DOJ investigation involved in your dad?

53:30.560 --> 53:31.560
You're the one that told me that.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.560
I'm kidding, man. God!

53:33.560 --> 53:34.560
Monty, okay.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.560
Just be patient.

53:35.560 --> 53:38.560
Allow me my narrative pasting.

53:39.560 --> 53:42.560
So, what we do know about Bill at that point

53:42.560 --> 53:43.560
is that he views...

53:43.560 --> 53:45.560
Allow me my narrative pasting.

53:45.560 --> 53:48.560
He feels like

53:48.560 --> 53:51.560
he is kind of being wedged into a doubly.

53:51.560 --> 53:52.560
He doesn't really want,

53:52.560 --> 53:54.560
but he's just been publicly humiliated twice.

53:54.560 --> 53:55.560
Yeah.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.560
And this is kind of face-saving

53:57.560 --> 53:59.560
and it's some way to get a little bit of lost status back.

53:59.560 --> 54:00.560
Yeah, that's right.

54:00.560 --> 54:01.560
He's not getting...

54:01.560 --> 54:03.560
I mean, he's getting paid a lot by human standards,

54:03.560 --> 54:04.560
but not by bankers.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.560
It's an extra hundred grand.

54:08.560 --> 54:10.560
So, around that time,

54:10.560 --> 54:13.560
Bill and

54:13.560 --> 54:16.560
Aala reconnect with Scott Mitchell.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.560
Do you know Scott Mitchell?

54:17.560 --> 54:19.560
Yeah, he's come a few times.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.560
He's Edson's son.

54:20.560 --> 54:21.560
Right.

54:21.560 --> 54:25.560
And they hadn't seen each other in a decade,

54:25.560 --> 54:27.560
but in 2012,

54:27.560 --> 54:29.560
Scott happened to sit down for lunch

54:29.560 --> 54:31.560
or something with Anshu.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.560
Anshu pushed the two of them to...

54:33.560 --> 54:36.560
pushed the Mitchell and Brooks McClanns

54:36.560 --> 54:37.560
to like...

54:37.560 --> 54:38.560
because they'd been...

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
there's a huge following up

54:39.560 --> 54:42.560
because Bill and Aala had supported...

54:42.560 --> 54:43.560
Estelle.

54:43.560 --> 54:44.560
Estelle, which, you know,

54:44.560 --> 54:45.560
not surprisingly,

54:45.560 --> 54:47.560
Susan and her kids

54:47.560 --> 54:48.560
viewed as a betrayal.

54:48.560 --> 54:49.560
Right.

54:49.560 --> 54:54.560
And Scott is...

54:54.560 --> 54:56.560
both Bill and Scott

54:56.560 --> 54:57.560
agree to a meeting.

54:57.560 --> 54:58.560
They book reservations for lunch

54:58.560 --> 54:59.560
and then they keep...

54:59.560 --> 55:00.560
each of them keeps canceling.

55:00.560 --> 55:01.560
Right.

55:01.560 --> 55:02.560
And finally,

55:02.560 --> 55:04.560
they get thanks to some product

55:04.560 --> 55:05.560
from Bill's assistant.

55:05.560 --> 55:08.560
They finally, like, plan for lunch.

55:08.560 --> 55:10.560
And they go to a Japanese restaurant

55:10.560 --> 55:12.560
in Union Square, 15 East.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.560
And Alessa went to dinner.

55:14.560 --> 55:15.560
Okay.

55:15.560 --> 55:18.560
And so did Scott's sister.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.560
So it was Bill, Alessa, Scott,

55:20.560 --> 55:22.560
and Scott's sister, Ella.

55:22.560 --> 55:23.560
Okay.

55:23.560 --> 55:26.560
12 years since they'd seen each other.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.560
And Scott, at this point,

55:28.560 --> 55:31.560
is like a spitting image of Edson.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.560
And Alessa blurts out

55:33.560 --> 55:35.560
the moment they see him.

55:35.560 --> 55:36.560
He's Edson.

55:36.560 --> 55:37.560
Holy shit.

55:37.560 --> 55:39.560
Scott, who's a little bit drunk

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
because he had been so nervous

55:41.560 --> 55:42.560
and would, like, just drink a bunch

55:42.560 --> 55:44.560
before dinner.

55:44.560 --> 55:45.560
You know, sitting down,

55:45.560 --> 55:46.560
they're both...

55:46.560 --> 55:48.560
Scott's sweating profusely.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.560
And your dad ordered some nice wine.

55:51.560 --> 55:52.560
The more they drank,

55:52.560 --> 55:53.560
the more things calmed down,

55:53.560 --> 55:55.560
the more fun they're having.

55:55.560 --> 55:56.560
Scott does his...

55:56.560 --> 55:58.560
his arm show impersonation.

55:58.560 --> 56:00.560
You are smarter than hell and talented.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.560
How do we get you up to your metrics?

56:02.560 --> 56:04.560
Scott, by the way, is a used car salesman

56:04.560 --> 56:06.560
at that point.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.560
That's a horrible accent, isn't it?

56:08.560 --> 56:09.560
No, that's good.

56:09.560 --> 56:11.560
Bill loves it.

56:11.560 --> 56:12.560
Laughing.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.560
They're bantering about banking.

56:14.560 --> 56:16.560
Dinner ends.

56:16.560 --> 56:19.560
And Alessa takes the sister aside.

56:19.560 --> 56:22.560
The Scott's sister aside and says,

56:22.560 --> 56:24.560
this is him looking at pointing

56:24.560 --> 56:26.560
at your dad's direction.

56:26.560 --> 56:27.560
I haven't seen my father like this

56:27.560 --> 56:29.560
since Edson.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.560
End of that summer, Bill,

56:31.560 --> 56:34.560
and I'll invite Scott up to the house in Brooklyn.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.560
I spent the day drinking and reminiscing.

56:37.560 --> 56:40.560
And Bill joked about how he dodged a bullet

56:40.560 --> 56:43.560
by not getting the chief risk officer job.

56:43.560 --> 56:46.560
He tells Scott that he's about to retire,

56:46.560 --> 56:49.560
thinking about retiring for a final time.

56:49.560 --> 56:51.560
He keeps saying how much he misses Edson.

56:51.560 --> 56:54.560
And he keeps asking Scott for a state planning advice.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.560
For a state planning advice.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.560
Yes, Scott was mystified by that because...

56:58.560 --> 56:59.560
2012?

56:59.560 --> 57:01.560
This is summer 2012.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.560
Scott asked Bill,

57:03.560 --> 57:05.560
what would have happened if with Deutsche,

57:05.560 --> 57:06.560
Edson hadn't died?

57:06.560 --> 57:08.560
It would be a better worship.

57:08.560 --> 57:10.560
We would have made less money during the boom,

57:10.560 --> 57:13.560
but we would have lost less money

57:13.560 --> 57:15.560
during the bust, he said.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.560
Hmm.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.560
February 2013,

57:19.560 --> 57:21.560
annual bonuses get handed out.

57:21.560 --> 57:24.560
Bill asks Anchu for a private meeting.

57:24.560 --> 57:27.560
Tells Anchu that he's going to retire again.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.560
He's tired, he's deflated.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.560
He just wants it out.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.560
Anchu is laid,

57:35.560 --> 57:38.560
there's a million different fires burning inside Deutsche Bank right then.

57:38.560 --> 57:41.560
He convinces your dad to stick around

57:41.560 --> 57:44.560
for several more months.

57:44.560 --> 57:46.560
The...

57:46.560 --> 57:49.560
And there's like everywhere you look,

57:49.560 --> 57:51.560
there's scandals, everything,

57:51.560 --> 57:54.560
all the shoes sitting in the family right now.

57:55.560 --> 57:56.560
Well,

57:56.560 --> 57:59.560
I mean, today it's a bit worse.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.560
I mean, where were the scandals at the time?

58:01.560 --> 58:03.560
There were a lot of scandals.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.560
Libor?

58:04.560 --> 58:05.560
Libor,

58:05.560 --> 58:07.560
Russian merit trading was just bubbling up.

58:07.560 --> 58:08.560
Okay.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.560
There was a tally that the bank did

58:10.560 --> 58:12.560
that identified...

58:12.560 --> 58:13.560
I'm trying to find this number.

58:13.560 --> 58:14.560
The stress test,

58:14.560 --> 58:15.560
or before the stress test?

58:15.560 --> 58:17.560
The stress test was beginning the problem.

58:17.560 --> 58:18.560
There were,

58:18.560 --> 58:20.560
in the first eight months of 2013,

58:20.560 --> 58:23.560
there were 5,777 requests

58:23.560 --> 58:24.560
for information from regulators,

58:24.560 --> 58:26.560
which is about one per hour

58:26.560 --> 58:27.560
on average,

58:27.560 --> 58:29.560
and that's a very, very bad sign.

58:29.560 --> 58:30.560
Okay.

58:30.560 --> 58:31.560
There's...

58:31.560 --> 58:32.560
The net tech, basket trees.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.560
Yeah, the Fed is furious,

58:34.560 --> 58:36.560
the CFTC is furious,

58:36.560 --> 58:38.560
the SEC is investigating.

58:38.560 --> 58:39.560
So it's bubbling.

58:39.560 --> 58:40.560
Justice Department is starting

58:40.560 --> 58:42.560
a bunch of investigations.

58:42.560 --> 58:43.560
It's bubbling at this point.

58:43.560 --> 58:45.560
It hasn't really come to fruition.

58:45.560 --> 58:46.560
It's...

58:46.560 --> 58:49.560
their offices are being raided by police.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.560
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

58:51.560 --> 58:52.560
It's pretty bad.

58:52.560 --> 58:54.560
But you're right, it does get worse.

58:57.560 --> 58:58.560
So...

58:59.560 --> 59:00.560
Oh, look.

59:00.560 --> 59:01.560
We switched back to Val for a second.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.560
Oh, joy.

59:04.560 --> 59:06.560
Val possessed a man of charisma,

59:06.560 --> 59:08.560
and he charmed his way into recording studios

59:08.560 --> 59:10.560
and meetings with music industry professionals.

59:10.560 --> 59:12.560
His catalogue of the songs expanded.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.560
He got gigs.

59:14.560 --> 59:16.560
It's less lonely with an audience, he told me.

59:18.560 --> 59:19.560
Did you see that?

59:19.560 --> 59:20.560
Yep.

59:22.560 --> 59:25.560
2008, Urban Plaza.

59:25.560 --> 59:26.560
You meet Jenny,

59:26.560 --> 59:27.560
selling merchandise up front.

59:27.560 --> 59:28.560
Yeah.

59:29.560 --> 59:32.560
Start dating, she's from New York.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.560
Moved to London,

59:33.560 --> 59:35.560
two bedroom flat in Pentishtown.

59:35.560 --> 59:36.560
Yeah.

59:36.560 --> 59:37.560
Good.

59:41.560 --> 59:43.560
Your parents paid the rent

59:43.560 --> 59:46.560
and distributed roughly 50 grand a year.

59:46.560 --> 59:47.560
Is that right?

59:48.560 --> 59:49.560
It was...

59:50.560 --> 59:51.560
The rent?

59:51.560 --> 59:52.560
I mean, including the rent?

59:52.560 --> 59:53.560
No, not including the rent.

59:53.560 --> 59:55.560
Oh, yeah, it's about $50,000.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.560
I'm noting that

59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.560
you really wanted your dad to respect

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.560
and that you want to please your dad

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560
because that's normal.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.560
Of course.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560
Yeah, and it's nothing bad.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.560
But he also viewed it as the more...

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.560
the more he viewed you as responsible,

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.560
the more he would trust you.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560
And there was...

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.560
I'm mentioning this...

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560
I think this was...

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560
What's the film producer again?

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560
What's his name?

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.560
Lawrence.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.560
No.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560
Jerecki.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.560
Jerecki.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.560
So you told Jerecki...

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.560
I guess I'm also trying to...

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.560
So you propose investment from your dad

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560
into Jerecki's business.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560
And you say to Jerecki?

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.560
I guess I'm also trying to prove to him

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.560
that I can make sound and confident choices with money.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.560
Yeah, I know this was a...

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.560
David Gran.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.560
I was trying to put Jerecki with David Gran

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.560
for his other book before it was made into...

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560
Velocity of Z.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.560
So I was trying to put those two together

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.560
and then Jerecki wanted something about this...

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560
You have the email, right?

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.560
It should all be in that email.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.560
I've got the email.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.560
And I was trying to put my dad in the middle too.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.560
But yeah, it sounds about right.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560
I mean, close enough.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.560
So we begin to hear a little bit

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.560
about your dad's view of you and money.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.560
Okay.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.560
Enjoy, yes.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.560
You're nuts.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.560
Earn more...

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.560
Sorry.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560
You're nuts.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560
Earn some money, he told you.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.560
When you're asked for your stipend to be increased.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560
Yes.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:35.560
Another time your allowance was frittered away somehow

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.560
and you...

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.560
He moved on to a weekly payment plan instead of a monthly.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.560
Yeah, that was a terrible idea.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.560
And I know that Bill, like, was pretty short with you sometimes.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.560
Yeah.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.560
If you meant to annoy, you succeeded.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.560
Yeah.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.560
I told you I'm on occasion.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.560
I'm not sure you're gonna like this part.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.560
I'm noting that you had an unkempt beard

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.560
and while your shoulder length hair was mingy on the sides,

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.560
the top was as bald as a coot.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.560
It's not that bald.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560
It's pretty fucking tall.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560
I mean, come on.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560
There's still some...

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560
That's about as bald as a coot.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560
Some strands.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.560
Some strands.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.560
Is that what you're gonna call that?

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560
Some strands left.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.560
I'm saying that your clothes were old and tattered

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.560
and your friends didn't think they were very stylish.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.560
Quote, he looked like a right tramp.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.560
One of your...

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560
Who was this?

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.560
This was Simon Saren.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.560
Simon said that a fucker.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.560
Okay.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.560
He said you push, push, push some more.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.560
That friends could tell that you had money,

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.560
they didn't quite know where it came from.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560
You would say your mom was an artist

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.560
and your dad was a math guy,

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.560
something about algorithms.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560
I never said that.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560
Well, that sounds about right.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.560
I said my dad was a banker.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.560
He was a math guy.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560
I mean, he was a math guy.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560
That's not inaccurate.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.560
It was just vague.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.560
Why would I hide that he's a banker?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560
Well, that was actually interesting.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.560
I talked to Simon about that.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.560
I asked him that very question.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:14.560
And he said it's just not like a good look in London

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.560
at that point to be...

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.560
A banker's son?

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560
Yeah.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560
Not a good look.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.560
Anyway, he told me a story.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.560
It sounds like Simon created his own sort of story.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.560
This is kind of going to hurt your street cred.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.560
Oh, my street cred.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.560
Don't have street cred.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.560
Okay.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.560
Well, not for long.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.560
So Simon agreed to do like a photo shoot

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.560
for a Bikini Roulette Army cover, album cover.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560
Agreed.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.560
Or offered or whatever.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560
Okay.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.560
And what he offered was to help make over your wardrobe

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.560
and get proper clothes for this.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.560
Right.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.560
And he says that you suggested they go to Harrod's.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.560
He said bloody hell and took you to Camden Market.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560
That's right.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560
That's true.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560
I didn't know.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.560
I thought Harrod's had some cool shit.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.560
What's wrong with Harrod's?

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.560
I don't know, man.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.560
It's not as cool as Camden Market,

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.560
but Harrod's still nice.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.560
If I had a choice between Harrod's and Camden Market,

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560
would you go to Harrod's or Camden Market?

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.560
It depends what look that I try to fill off.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.560
I wouldn't go to either, to be honest.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.560
I would go to the Gap.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560
To the Gap.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.560
So that's a sign of my fashion sense.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.560
Okay.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.560
So I'm telling the story of how you and Beth met.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.560
Yes.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.560
At a party in 2011.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560
Yes.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.560
She saw you across the room.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.560
There was something magnetic about you.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.560
She needed to know who this cocky guy was.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560
So sweet.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.560
She walked over and started talking.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.560
She's captivated, so confident, so brash, so American.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560
Come on, dear.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560
Cheesy.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.560
Cheesy.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.560
You made a crack about how she looked just like Patty Boyd.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560
She knew who Patty Boyd was,

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.560
but she was very flattered and she got on and googled it.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.560
And by the following spring, so we're in 2012 now,

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.560
Jenny's had a picture and you and Beth are living together.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560
Yes.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.560
She realized that you were a hoarder.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560
A hoarder.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560
A hoarder.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560
Years worth of junk.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.560
Ticket stubs, tattered artwork, both clothes.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.560
Occupying every drawer and shelf in the apartment.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560
What?

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.560
That's not true at all.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.560
No?

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.560
That's maybe for books.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.560
I kept all these books, but I threw a lot of shit away.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560
Okay.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560
I need to see it.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.560
Wow.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560
Excuse me.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560
No.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560
Wow.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560
Amazing.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560
I did not throw...

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.560
There were some things I did not throw away.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560
I reluctantly corroborate.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560
But not a hoarder.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560
Because images...

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.560
It's a businessman.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.560
When I think of a hoarder, I see that images on television with people stacking up piles

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.560
in these papers.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.560
That's not...

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.560
Well, we can set up.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.560
I mean, I don't know.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.560
It's a majority.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.560
I mean, it's not a compliment.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.560
He's absolutely a hoarder, isn't he?

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560
You're not.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.560
Thank you.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.560
I'm highly confident in the accuracy of that description.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.560
She's not exaggerating.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.560
Yeah.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.560
Good.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.560
Here you go, buddy.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:08.560
I'm just trying to find another pack of cigarettes.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.560
Here it is.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.560
He's actually a very hoarder.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.560
He's got, like, city tickets.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:22.560
But he doesn't have stacks of newspapers.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Yeah.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.560
He keeps every cinema ticket, every note.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.560
It's amazing.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.560
Well, hey, it's a good way to jog your memory.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560
It's a very good way.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560
Yeah.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560
It's a good way.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.560
She says it is fondly, by the way.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.560
Okay.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.860
She wanted to do things like cook dinner and go out on dates and explore London in the

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.560
daylight with her boyfriend.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Believe it or not, your sleeping habits were not conducive to that, which is maybe a little

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.560
frustrating to her.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:59.020
One of the things that surprised her about you was that you, at first glance, came across

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:04.020
to her as this brash, charismatic, hyper-confident American.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.100
And I think maybe I've told you about this.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:11.860
She found you to be extremely anxious, sometimes tongue-tied, by anxiety before performances.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:19.740
And she gave me a specific example of a performance at the 100 Club on Oxford Street, where you

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:26.400
wrapped up your set, then shouted into the microphone, someone needs to call me an ambulance.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:32.960
And the crowd looked at you silently, not clear, or not sure if you were serious or not.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.160
And then you fled offstage.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.480
And Beth, rushed backstage, thinking you were having some sort of breakdown, can't find

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:45.440
you, spent a while exploring the labby runth of, I guess, is that club's underground area.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.720
And eventually, leaves me, she can't find you.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.960
And there, on the sidewalk, you're sitting there sweating, panicked, and unable to speak,

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960
she says.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.480
And I thought I was going to die.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.480
Why?

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:04.360
Lane, Lane Hines was playing with me, and Lane had a party the night before.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.320
So, well, actually, Lane wasn't scheduled to play with you, I was supposed to play alone,

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.800
but we went to Lane's house, we had a party, we were up all night, a lot of cocaine, a lot

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.800
of cocaine.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800
And we did not sleep.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.520
And then sometime around 7am, he said, Lane, why don't you join me on stage?

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.920
He's like, OK, it's cocaine conversation.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.520
And then we just decided not to sleep and stay up to the show.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.240
So we get to the hunter club, like, at night, cooked up out of our heads with the guitars.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.560
And then I start performing, and I was so exhausted, and then not only the anxiety from

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.320
playing mixed with the cocaine, mixed with the no sleep, I thought I was going to die

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320
at the last song.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.320
Like, I was singing.

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.240
I didn't think I was going to finish the song.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.920
And so I thought I was going to fall right off the fucking stage and die.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.920
So he said, call me an ambulance.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920
And I was dead serious.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.920
I thought I was going to die.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.120
So I had to go outside and catch my breath and calm down and relax.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120
It's terrible.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.120
Well, that matches up pretty well.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120
Yeah.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120
That's your perspective.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.120
I've now got both perspectives of them.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120
They mesh.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.120
So you and Bill go to Wimbledon.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:16.120
June 2013, lovely picture of you guys together there.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.120
Faded Giants hat that couldn't corral your long hair.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:24.720
Half button denim shirt that exposed your chest.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.420
Your bearded face projecting too cool for school detachment.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:41.920
You at one point asked Bill, asked your dad, say, tell me about work, and he didn't answer.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:51.720
I'm noting, let's say, going into that suicide at the Swiss insurance company where Ackerman

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.720
had gone on to.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.720
The double murder suicide?

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.720
No.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.720
No, that's a different one.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:04.320
This is the one in fall of 2013, and your dad and some of his friends afterwards are

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.840
emailing about this one and saying it doesn't look too good for Ackerman because this guy

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:14.160
had just hung himself and left a suicide note that blamed Ackerman for putting too much

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.160
pressure on him.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.160
Did it?

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.160
Yeah.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.160
I didn't know this.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160
That's public.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160
I didn't know that.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160
What did they not say?

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.160
Do you have it in there?

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160
I don't.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:30.360
Ackerman then resigned from that company and said, I have reason to believe that the families

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.640
of the opinion that I should take my share of responsibility.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:38.800
He later told someone that a certain amount of pressure or occasional factual criticism

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.280
were perfectly normal in such positions.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.000
They did not even begin to justify suicide.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I remember this.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Yes.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Okay.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.640
The wife had done a campaign.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640
The wife blamed him.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640
Yes.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640
Yes.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.640
Okay.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.640
So Bill retires.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.640
His official last day of work is August 31st.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:02.160
You asked him why he was quitting, and he says, quote, there is really no logical next

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.520
step for me at DB after board appointment fell through, which is fine.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.240
I lasted a lot longer than I thought I would.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:15.080
Anshu hosts a lunch for him with about a dozen people.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:19.640
He gave a little speech, toasted Bill for his work.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.320
Afterwards Bill, you welcome to thank him.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.920
It's a very nice thing.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920
You know it.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.680
Anshu responds, you've made a very important contribution to this institution and to many

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:28.680
lives.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680
Thanks.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680
Let's stay in touch.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.680
Would you kind of stiffen a slightly distant tone?

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:39.680
Well, it's meant for, you know, it's not like a personal note.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680
No, it was.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.680
These are personal emails.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.680
Oh, that's all I can say.

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.680
He turns 58.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.680
Oh, this is the email I sent you?

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.680
This is stuff I've gotten from you, yeah.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.680
That I sent you?

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.680
Okay.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.680
The only person who's been sending me Bill Brooksman's emails.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.680
Okay.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.680
Right.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.680
I just, for never mind.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.680
Sorry.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:09.680
They plan to stay in London another year and do some traveling.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.680
I'm getting into just some of that.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.680
Oh, noting that they made plans to go to South Africa and then Iran the following spring of

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.680
2014.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.680
Great.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.680
Bill tries to learn a little French.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.680
He takes some writing classes.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.680
He prefers to get his driver's license, experiments in the kitchen.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.680
He's enjoying being very lazy and unproductive.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.680
He writes to a former colleague.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.680
He finds himself drinking more and more.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.680
Thanksgiving of 2013, he and his mom fly back to New York.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.680
Bill goes to lunch with Saman Maj, who, you know, is net by this point a finance professor

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.680
at Yale.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.680
And Bill complains that he's missing his job.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.680
The mark is the adrenaline, the challenge.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.680
He asks Saman, how do you manage it?

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.680
Don't you miss it?

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.680
And it, Maj says he's found fulfillment in academia and suggests that Bill finds something

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.680
to do with his life.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.680
Instead, Bill remains very immersed, as you know, in DBTCA.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:15.680
And it, which is engulfed in, like, rapidly expanding series of problems.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.680
They don't even have a CFO.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.680
They're kind of whitewashing these fed stress tests.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:30.680
He pushes, as you know, your dad pushes a lot to, you know, take things more seriously

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.680
and, like, get up to speed.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.680
That does not really seem to be working very well.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.680
Like, no one seems to be taking it all that seriously.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:49.680
And, okay, December 2013, you meet your parents for sushi.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.680
And this is where we get into the U.S.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.680
He asks you what your long-term plans are for all the music.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:01.680
He says how much it would cost to, like, do it all.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.680
And for a glorious moment, you think your dad's about to offer to bankroll all of them.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.680
Instead, he asks how you'll support yourself when he's gone.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.680
You ask, are you sick?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:18.680
Well, I made a joke, too, because I didn't want him to think that I was giving a number to bankroll it.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.680
So it's not exactly...

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.680
I'm not suggesting at all that you're like money broke.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.680
No, I made a specific joke.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.680
I said $1 billion, because I didn't want him to think that I was, like...

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.680
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.680
You say, are you sick?

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680
He shakes his head.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.680
Ola answers, your father is fine.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680
Right.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.680
A week or two later, you and Beth go out to dinner with them.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:51.680
That's when you give the Steve Miller band anthology and the record player, which Ola did not like.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.680
There's a gospel choir singing in the restaurant.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.680
Yeah, that's right.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:03.680
Your dad had actually a really engaging conversation about pop music, which seemed out of character for him, but interesting.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.680
Yeah.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.680
At the end of the dinner, he hugged you.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.680
This is an unusual display of physical affection and says, I love you very much.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.680
Hand to a holiday card.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.680
Enjoy the holidays here and we'll see you in January.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.680
In front of the car, there is a picture of Daisy that Ola had drawn.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:29.680
This little card is blue and white, except for the dog's red leash.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.680
Huh.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.680
Okay.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.680
That month...

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.680
I didn't pick up on that.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.680
Is that right?

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.680
Take a look.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.680
Yeah, I did see it again.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.680
It's the only thing that stands out in the card is the red leash.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680
It does, right?

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.680
Yep.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680
Do you have it?

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.680
Yeah, I send it to him.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.680
I don't know if he sent it to me or if he showed it to me.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.680
Yeah, he must have sent it to me.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.680
I took a picture of it and emailed it to you.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680
Yeah.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.680
Yeah.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.680
Wow.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.680
I didn't even miss that.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.680
That's pretty quick.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.680
Yeah.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.680
Good catch.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:15.680
So that month, one afternoon, Bill arranged to meet up with Martin Luft, who was his partner back in the olden days at Deutsche Bank,

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.680
the guy, the military guy.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.680
Some people thought he was a special forces.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.680
And they agreed to meet at Gales.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.680
Gales, that big chain of little cafes and coffee shops in London.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.680
Barely.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.680
It was kind of a fixture in my neighborhood anyway.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.680
And also in Chelsea.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.680
And Bill shows up in his gym clothes.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.680
He just came from the gym.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680
He's sweaty.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.680
And so he's sitting in the crowded cafe reminiscing.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:49.680
And Loat has been, he gave up on the banking industry and is kind of telling Bill about how he's just like happier than he's ever been in his life.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:58.680
He's got like a small house now and he goes to pub quizzes and jogs and skis and just things are simpler.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.680
Tries to get your dad enthusiastic about this new phase of his retirement.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:09.680
And Loat can tell that Bill is just like dwelling on things.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.680
And at one point he says to Loat that he's wrestling with a problem.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.680
And he says the bank had done a trade with a client.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.680
The client hadn't fully understood what he'd been getting into.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.680
And now there's a big mess.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.680
It sounded to Loat a lot like the Orange County.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.680
Well, it sounded like that, but you're right.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.680
That's very good.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.680
This is three weeks before your dad kills himself.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.680
He also says...

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.680
It could be why my dad asked for the Orange County memo again.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.680
If this is looming on him.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.680
Or it could be Monica DePasque.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.680
Because that's really what this sounds like to me.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.680
Bill asked Martin what he should do.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.680
And Loat, who was not very good at reading people, could tell that Bill was like really upset.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:02.680
And Loat had never forgotten a lesson that Bill had taught him back in their early days together.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.680
There was a lesson that Reverend Jack had actually told Bill.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.680
Which is that do write by other people, be honest with them, treat them ethically, things will work out in the end.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.680
And so he told Bill that.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.680
He said, I remember when I had a problem with this back in the early days of Deutsche.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.680
This is what you told me and now I'm telling it to you.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:23.680
And Bill looked at him, kind of stared off into the distance, didn't say anything.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.680
And there's an awkward silence.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.680
I think my father realizes his own...

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.680
It's the word fallibility in that sentence.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.680
His own premature...

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.680
What's the word?

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:46.680
Juvenile understanding of morality.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.680
I mean he recognizes his...

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.680
It's the word.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.680
It's a perfect word.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.680
It's escaping my mind.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.680
Immature understanding of morality.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.680
It's very do write by others and they will do write by you.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.680
He's learning more and more is not true.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:08.680
It's a lot more grayer than that.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.680
I think it might be simpler.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.680
I think his whole life is understanding that less, more and more.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.680
He is the moral center of everything and he has always been.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.680
And more he learns, especially after his father died, who was the...

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:30.680
Mr. Moralistic, the pillars of the family and everything else.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.680
He realizes that this is a fallacy.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.680
We're going to get into some of the stuff with his dad dying a little bit.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.680
Just in my chronology.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.680
I'm sure to hear Martin Lewis say that to him.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.680
He sees his own hubris.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.680
My take of...

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.680
It's really interesting.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.680
My dad's not this deep.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.680
I mean he's a very bright guy and he knows that something like this,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.680
saying this is like putting a band-aid on a fucking...

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:00.680
Or maybe he's just deeply upset about whatever...

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.680
I mean, Loats take away from this.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.680
A sword wound.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.680
I think was that...

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.680
Do you get what I'm saying?

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.680
100% of what you're saying.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.680
I'm not being dismissive when I say that.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.680
It's really interesting.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.680
I hadn't thought about that.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.680
So off they go with the girls to Virgin Gorda.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.680
But what were you going to say before you think...

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.680
I just think the simpler explanation, which isn't necessarily the right one,

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.680
is that...

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.680
But the one that was in my head is that...

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:36.680
Bill is really worried about a transaction or transaction

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.680
that the bank has done with a client that are now boomeranging back at them.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.680
And he's worried about his culpability in that.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.680
That's too simple.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.680
Because what we know now is that McKaylee Faisola did this transaction.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.680
Well, we don't know what's Monodiposki, by the way.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.680
That's an assumption.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.680
Well, I mean, what else could it be?

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.680
Look, we'll get into what Bill knew about Monodiposki.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.680
Basket trades are over.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680
Library's over.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.680
Well, in fact, hang on.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.680
What else is going on?

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.680
No, they're not over.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.680
Well, I mean...

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.680
No, hang on.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.680
We can do this right now if you want.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.680
In fact, the Monodiposki investigation was scheduled

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:16.680
to begin on Monday, January 27th.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.680
Really?

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.680
Yes.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.680
Monday, January 27th.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.680
Yeah.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.680
So what is that?

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.680
One day after your death?

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.680
It's the Monday.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680
Yeah, it's the day after.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.680
Libor was not anywhere near done at that point.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:31.680
In fact, what had happened with Libor is that a bunch of people had just been arrested

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.680
in the UK because of Libor.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.680
Right.

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.680
And anyway, let's get...

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.680
We'll come back to that.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.680
So you're...

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.680
Do you think that...

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.680
That means anything?

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.680
I think your dad was...

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.680
No, I mean, the investigation is starting on 27.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.680
Do you see anything in that?

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.680
It's a hell of a coincidence.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.680
It is, right?

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.680
They got into broken board.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.680
But what we know is that Faisola handled this trade.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.680
And my dad, we know for a fact that he went to Anchu...

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.680
Let's come back to that.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.680
And he said no about this trade.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.680
He said no.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.680
And Faisola went around his back.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.680
He went around my dad's back and ran Anchu's back.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.680
He did not...

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.680
He did not go through the proper channels.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.680
Faisola has a very different take on that.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.680
And...

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.680
No shit.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.680
He's under 16 fucking indictments from law.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.680
And he's gonna...

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.680
Yeah, but that stuff is just nonsense.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.680
It's not nonsense.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.680
It's not nonsense.

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.680
It's not nonsense.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680
Well, because Italian...

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680
I hear what you're saying.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.680
Okay.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.680
There's...

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680
As long as I'm clear.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.680
Okay.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:28.680
You're clear.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.680
But look, what we can stipulate here is that your dad killed himself.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.680
Right?

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.680
We know that.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.680
And we know that he was worried about stuff at work.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.680
And so it's not a question of was he worried about stuff at work.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.680
We know he was.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.680
But you're saying he's worried about his own culpability.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680
And I'm saying...

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.680
I'm not saying that.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680
I'm saying...

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.680
Yeah, you just said that he was...

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.680
He expressed his worry about how culpable he was in whatever this trade may be.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.680
And I'm saying that he's not culpable in anything, as we all know.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.680
I'm not saying he's culpable.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:59.680
I mean, looking back, again, hindsight, there's absolutely nothing putting him in any terrible

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.680
trades or any kind of money laundering schemes or basket trades.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.680
I'm not saying he's culpable.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.680
I'm saying he's worried he's culpable.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.680
But he knows he's not culpable, because he knows he has done nothing wrong.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.680
So that worries the paradox.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:15.680
Well, we'll come back to that, because we know the way his psychologist...

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.680
What he told his psychologist and his doctor also.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.680
Okay.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.680
But we're going to come back to all of this.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.680
Okay.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.680
I promise.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.680
They go off to Virgin Gorda in the Caribbean.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.680
They spend a couple of days at a resort.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.680
And then go with...

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:33.680
During which, when Bill phones into a board meeting about problems with the Fed, then they

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:38.680
join Michael Morandy, his wife and some others, and the Morandy's 47-foot sailboat.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.680
They swim.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.680
They snorkel.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.680
They drink.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.680
They smoke.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.680
They run up cigarettes.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.680
They search boats.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:45.680
They ask for a half-soaked cigarette.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.680
They drink some more.

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.680
Your mom tries to convince Bill to buy a sailboat.

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.680
Bill kind of goes along with it.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.680
New Year's Day, motorboat takes them to the airport.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:59.680
Bill gets sick and pukes.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:05.680
And at this time, a couple of your dad's friends who've been spending time with him started

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.680
looking, thinking that it was a little weird that they didn't...

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.680
They felt that they didn't know your dad that well.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.680
They knew him.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:22.680
He's a great friend, a loyal friend, like a brilliant, ethical, fascinating, but they

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.680
didn't know him.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680
They didn't know his emotions.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.680
And some of this, I think, is probably just men being men, right?

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:28.680
Right.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.680
This is something that more than one friend, very close friend, who I talked to said.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:39.680
And they used words like, they didn't really know him.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.680
Not an emotional level.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:41.680
Yeah, but you know what?

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.680
Whatever.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.680
It's just a bunch of bullshit.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.680
Because everyone thinks they know someone.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.680
And then when someone does something unexpected, like a suicide, you look back and think,

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.680
I never really knew the guy, because I didn't see that coming.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.680
No, it's not that.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.680
If somebody saw it coming, they could say, oh, I knew him well.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:55.680
I saw it coming.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.680
Fair enough.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.680
Right?

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.680
No, I don't think it's quite that simple.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.680
But fair enough.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.680
I think it's quite, I think it is that simple.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.680
They get back to London.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.680
And they distance themselves from this person.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.680
Oh, I didn't know this person, because I did not see this person.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.680
They're not saying that in that context.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.680
They're not saying, oh, I didn't see this person.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.680
Of course, it's all in that context.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:13.680
You're right.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.680
I mean, I'm obviously talking to all these people.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:16.680
Yes, in that context.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.680
In the context of them having killed themselves a few weeks later.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.680
Right.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.680
But let's just leave it.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:21.680
I hear what you're saying.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.680
Okay.

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:23.680
Yeah.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.680
Come back to London.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.680
He tells Ola that they're going to New York for another DVD sale.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680
Board meeting.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.680
They're going to do the wills.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.680
He tells Ola that he has to meet with the feds when he's there.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.680
That, I think, has been kind of mis-transposed.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.680
And he actually meant meet with the fed.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:46.680
Capital F.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.680
Right.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.680
Because he'd been having phone conversations with the fed.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.680
Is this the Mark Stein stuff?

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.680
No.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.680
That's not Mark Stein.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.680
This is separate.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.680
And this is, we'll come back to this.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:01.680
So, I just told you, Monty Deposky has collapsed at this point.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.680
Faisal, their criminal investigation is in Italy.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:08.680
The Germans are about to start a big new investigation on Monday, January 27th.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680
Okay.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680
Friday, January 24th.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.680
Anshu is in Davos partying.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.680
The world is good.

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.680
My favorite line in the book is in this section.

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.680
And it describes the party that Deutsche Bank threw hours before your dad killed himself.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:27.680
In Davos?

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.680
Yeah.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.680
And I was there.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.680
You were there?

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:31.680
Yeah.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.680
With Anshu and his wife.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.680
And it's a happy scene.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.680
Anshu's wife really humanizes him.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:46.680
Ackerman is there and making peace after this huge violent falling out.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.680
Bald men's heads.

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.680
Bald men's heads shine with sweat.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.680
Which I just obsessed with that line.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.680
Party goes into the early hours of the following morning.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.680
Is that your line?

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.680
Yeah, that's mine.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.680
That's pretty good.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.680
I thought that was Anshu's.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.680
I figured it was quitting Anshu.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:02.680
Okay.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:06.680
A few hundred miles to the northwest.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.680
Dance with sweat.

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:10.680
Bill and Alde go out to dinner.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:11.680
I could improve on it just a little bit.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.680
Bald heads men dance with sweat.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.680
Bill and Alde go out to dinner.

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:17.680
It's a no.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.680
And then for the final time he falls asleep.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.680
And sorry, is that it again?

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.680
For the final time he falls asleep.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.680
Okay.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.680
Wait, what was the line before that?

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:28.680
I'm not reading it.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.680
You didn't hear it.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.680
There was no line before it as far as I thought.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.680
Okay, can we take a break for a sec?

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680
Yeah.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.680
Okay.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.680
This is in part one.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.680
Yeah.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:43.680
That was more an emotionally exhausting than I thought.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.680
Okay.
