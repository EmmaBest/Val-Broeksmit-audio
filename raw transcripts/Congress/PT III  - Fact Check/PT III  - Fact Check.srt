1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
I think the position should be pretty good, right?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,520
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,640
You want your full body, no?

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
In the shot.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
Me or Val?

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
Everybody.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,240
Well, what part of me is in the shot now?

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, it's just, I mean, maybe you could just a little bit on there.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Where's your, where's...

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, like this.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, so where's his free man, so he doesn't...

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,040
Yeah, I thought it was right around here, because keep in mind it goes, once you actually

15
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,080
hit play, hit record.

16
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
It's going to go over more.

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,080
It's not over CC.

18
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
Oh, yeah, because this is...

19
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
Yeah, you've got room.

20
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
No, sorry.

21
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Is this okay right now?

22
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Yeah, that's great.

23
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Okay, great.

24
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Okay.

25
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Oh, Kida.

26
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
So, we are...

27
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:54,880
We are in the early days of them at Deutsche Bank, and so Edson is, as I've said, and as

28
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:03,080
you know, just like, he's unbridled id, and that's like, that's what he is.

29
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,600
He's like a big bundle of id.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
And Bill...

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,080
A bit of ego.

32
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,360
Bill is more the super ego, right?

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,880
He's the one who is reserved, he kind of restrains the...

34
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,880
He's a practical one.

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,800
He's practical, he's conservative, and he's just like down to earth.

36
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,600
Sometimes in ways that people make fun of him for, like he takes the tube to work, which

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,360
is crazy, because these guys do not take the tube, and they take the tube.

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
No, he loves the tube.

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Yeah, he loves the tube.

40
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Loves the subway.

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
He loves trains.

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
Loves trains.

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,000
I like trains, too.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So one of...

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Bill was kind of running a business, but he had a co-head of the business, a guy named

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Martin Loat.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Loat?

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
He was a retired British military officer.

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
What's he a military officer?

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
He was in...

51
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,480
The rumor was that, which wasn't true, is that he was a Special Forces officer, but he's

52
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
just...

53
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
He's not.

54
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
He was in the military.

55
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
Like, doing life in the military.

56
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,480
I think he was in the army, I'm not quite sure what he was doing.

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,520
It doesn't really matter, for these purposes.

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,480
So, sorry, Bill took Martin under his wing a bit, and kind of trained him on...

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
Especially when it came to ethical things.

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
So he...

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,760
He trained Martin on that, yes.

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,760
And it...

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,640
So Martin always looked up to him.

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,800
Bill's mantra, which he'd always repeat, was, let's get down to first principles.

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
First principles.

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,040
Yeah, so he would, you know, let's cut to the chase.

67
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,480
Let's look at things from boiling down to their essence.

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,120
He...

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,320
When there was a problem, he would be dispatched to clean it up.

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,800
There's a financial crisis in Asia.

71
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,080
Bill's immediately on the flight to Hong Kong.

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,320
He reminded some of his colleagues of the wolf character in Pulp Fiction.

73
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,440
Oh, yeah, the fixer, sure.

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,520
Yeah, the fixer.

75
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Some colleagues...

76
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,880
Yeah, and one of the good things about his restraining influence

77
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,840
on Edson is that, you know, he calmed people when times were too good, and he made people

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,840
kind of just be a little more restrained.

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
Some people, some of his colleagues told me, a number of his colleagues told me, that they

80
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,000
wondered if maybe he was depressed.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That was...

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, because he was...

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,640
He dampened everything.

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
It was like...

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
But if it was...

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah, if everyone was, you know, extremely joyful, he said, we'll come back down to Earth

87
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
and let's...

88
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,840
I think what you guys described it to me is that he managed to drain the emotions from

89
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
everything.

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
No, but he was...

91
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Everyone was too depressed.

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Let's not argue about this.

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm just saying this with people with his colleagues' perception.

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,080
Okay, but let me give you the opposing viewpoint.

95
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,120
If someone was way too happy and joyful, it would say, you know, calm down a bit, let's

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,440
focus on what's needed to be done, you're over, you know, exaggerating with a lot of

97
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,760
this joy when you need to focus on the reality of the matter.

98
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,040
If someone was too low or depressed, you would say, you're focusing too much on this misery

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,160
instead of the practicality of it.

100
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,920
There's no need for this depression if you think things through.

101
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Just like there's no need for this excess joy because there's something always looming

102
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
in the background.

103
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Be prepared for everything.

104
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I completely understand what you're saying.

105
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,960
And that can be misinterpreted as depression, depending on who he's talking to.

106
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,520
If he's talking to someone that's really happy and my dad comes in and says he wants to burst

107
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,880
their bubble, they're going to say how he was depressed.

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't be so defensive about the kinds of depression.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not...

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I certainly...

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,960
I just wanted to make it clear that that is very, very much dependent on one's perception

112
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,400
and the situation all as well.

113
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,960
So if someone's to say he's depressed because he bursted my bubble...

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,160
As you'll see as we go through this, there are a lot of people who at various points

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
wonder if Bill is depressed.

116
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Okay, but that's why I'm just...

117
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,080
I know you're making the case for this depression and I'm just making the case against him.

118
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,480
I'm not making the case for depression.

119
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm saying accurately, obviously, that that is the way a number of colleagues told me

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
that that is what they...

121
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
They didn't say he was depressed.

122
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,760
They're saying they wondered if maybe he was depressed.

123
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
That was how they perceived it.

124
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,200
And during what points in time?

125
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
I mean, this was...

126
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Throughout...

127
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Yeah, I mean at different points in time.

128
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,400
So this point that I'm talking about right now is in around 97.

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay.

130
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
So this is shortly after...

131
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
This is a year or so after he's joined the Beck.

132
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Okay.

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
And maybe two years after he's joined the Beck.

134
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
After he's joined Deutsche.

135
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay, so let's see.

136
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,560
Edson started his affair with Estelle.

137
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Yes, Estelle.

138
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,840
Which is a wonderful story, but let's not even go there right now.

139
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
But you've included the story.

140
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Oh, yeah.

141
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Okay.

142
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
Oh, and Estelle becomes like a fairly significant character.

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Does she?

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Going for it.

145
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Yeah, okay.

146
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Did you talk to her?

147
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,560
I'm not going to get into who I talked to and who I didn't talk to.

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Okay.

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Okay, so Deutsche Bank does in the late night, in 98, it buys Banker's Trust.

150
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Yes.

151
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Which is...

152
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,560
It turns out to be a real disaster of...

153
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
That's kind of one of the original sins for Deutsche Bank.

154
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
It was buying up Banker's Trust.

155
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
I mean, it's a horrible deal.

156
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
And it's a terrible deal.

157
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
They're doing it.

158
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
For buying it up and turning it into DVTCA?

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Well, it became...

160
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,560
It kind of became a large number that became DVTCA.

161
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,560
This is like the kind of real point at which Deutsche Bank went from being a European-centered

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
investment bank into an American investment bank.

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Or becoming a European bank, a German bank into a global bank.

164
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
You could argue that.

165
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Well, it was already...

166
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
At that point, it was very big in London already.

167
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,560
It was asleep, as people describe it, a sleepy bank.

168
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
I think that was actually Landon.

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Landon Thomas.

170
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Sorry to hear about your...

171
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
No, I'm not being a dick.

172
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,560
It's just that Landon described it as a sleepy little bank at the time.

173
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
And he was right.

174
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,560
And then when my dad and I came along, I turned into a bad myth.

175
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Right.

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
But what I'm saying...

177
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
And buying DVTCA was part of that expansion.

178
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
No, no, no, no.

179
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
DVTCA, they didn't buy DVTCA.

180
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,560
I mean, buying Banker's Trust and becoming DVTCA was part of that expansion.

181
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Banker's Trust didn't become DVTCA.

182
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Like, Banker's Trust is a...

183
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
It's an early version of DVTCA.

184
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Okay, let's just move on.

185
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
It doesn't matter.

186
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
It matters.

187
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
It matters.

188
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm just wanting...

189
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Because this is a fact check, is it not?

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Yeah, but this is a fact check that we're doing of you and your father.

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Okay, fine.

192
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,560
You're just going to need to trust me that I'm this kind of stuff in particular.

193
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Okay.

194
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I have done a lot of research before.

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Okay, I believe you.

196
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
So, let's see.

197
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Okay, then we'll get into a bunch of Trump shit, which I'm not going to get into with you right now.

198
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Just purely for...

199
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Any background?

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Yeah, it's like the story of how Deutsche Bank got into Trump.

201
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Okay.

202
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
And...

203
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Do you know...

204
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Do you name names here?

205
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Yeah.

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Okay.

207
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Is this going to be breaking?

208
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Some of this has been told previously.

209
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Okay.

210
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Did you get off on the guys to sign the loans?

211
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
What was that?

212
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Did you write down the guys to sign the loans?

213
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
I think I saw that yesterday.

214
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
This is about the people who started the relationship with Trump.

215
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Okay.

216
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,560
What conclusions did you come to?

217
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Nothing.

218
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Oh, come on.

219
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
There's no...

220
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
There's...

221
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
No, it's not even that.

222
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
No, don't turn it off.

223
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
There's not...

224
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
What?

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Nothing groundbreaking or nothing...

226
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
There's interesting stuff.

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I can get into that right now.

228
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Okay.

229
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
There's...

230
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Any connections to Justice Kennedy?

231
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Nothing good.

232
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I feel like I'm the reporter and you're the source.

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Can you confirm or deny Justice Kennedy's involvement in the Sun?

234
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
No?

235
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Well, Justice...

236
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Yeah.

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Okay.

238
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
I'll let it go.

239
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Okay.

240
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Okay, so in 2000, Bill retires for a second time.

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay.

242
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,560
And he felt simultaneously overwhelmed and bored.

243
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Mm-hmm.

244
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
And he also felt like he was neglecting his daughters.

245
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Mm-hmm.

246
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
And maybe he's burning it.

247
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
So in August 2000, he decides to retire for the second time.

248
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Edson tried to keep him.

249
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,560
The bill kind of equivocated a little bit and then decided he needed to get out.

250
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Mm-hmm.

251
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
He was going to withdraw over several months.

252
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
He's going to spend time with his family and still be in Shakespeare,

253
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
involved in their soup kitchen.

254
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,560
And the...

255
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
What did you get?

256
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,560
He said to someone that it was hard to do a job and we've done it,

257
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,560
which didn't really run true, because the job was definitely not done.

258
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
And once again...

259
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Which job?

260
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Well, they're building Deutsche Bank into a modern institution,

261
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,560
and that was definitely not a finished thing.

262
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
By 2000?

263
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
No.

264
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I mean, that wasn't finished for years.

265
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Okay.

266
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
It still isn't finished.

267
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Well, I mean, it became from small to big.

268
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I think that's what he's referring to.

269
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Taking small banks is making it to big global bank.

270
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Right?

271
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,560
What I'm saying is that to the people he used those words with,

272
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
it did not run true.

273
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
It did not run true.

274
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Okay.

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
And I'm also saying that to some of his colleagues,

276
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,560
the fact that these retirements were becoming a pattern,

277
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,560
suggested to them that he was having some trouble covering with the pressure,

278
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
and that there was a certain fragility there.

279
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Okay.

280
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
And again, that's not...

281
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
That's simply the way they perceived it.

282
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Sure.

283
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Okay.

284
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Edson...

285
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Edson is kind of...

286
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,560
He's with Estelle and is, you know, losing.

287
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Bill's gone, and that check on him and Super Ego is gone,

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
and he's spinning a little bit of control.

289
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Edson.

290
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah.

291
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
And that, you guys.

292
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Yeah.

293
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,560
And I'm recounting the scene that you encountered

294
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
in the Park Avenue apartment.

295
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Yeah.

296
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,560
You could hear Sinead O'Connor,

297
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,560
which was weird because you got a hater Sinead O'Connor.

298
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Yeah.

299
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,560
And you went in and sat down with them, and he was crying,

300
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
and the song was on repeat,

301
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
and he said, Dad, you okay?

302
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
And he said, Not really, but I will be.

303
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
That sound about right?

304
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Yeah.

305
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
I sat with them for a while.

306
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Yeah.

307
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
You go over the whole thing.

308
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Okay.

309
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,560
So Bill says he will be okay.

310
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Deutsche Bank is not going to be okay because this is the moment

311
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
where everything starts to fall apart.

312
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Bill's gone, Edson's dead,

313
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,560
and a huge power struggle breaks out to fill with those voids.

314
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,560
And this is where Anshu starts to really gain power and climb.

315
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,560
And Anshu, as you know, is very ambitious.

316
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,560
And, okay, so we're going to skip a bunch of stuff right now

317
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,560
because it's just like, there's no, actually no or not.

318
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
We're coming right back to you.

319
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
We're coming right back to you right here.

320
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Did you do any parallels with what's going on at Merrill Lynch

321
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
at the time?

322
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Not really.

323
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,560
I mean, if we get into a bit later, like, that your dad was doing

324
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
some consulting.

325
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I didn't really feel like he was being listened to by Stan O'Neill

326
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
and down here.

327
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Okay.

328
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
And that Stan O'Neill was trying to get him to take a bigger job,

329
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
and your dad said, no, no, no, no, no, I just wouldn't do it.

330
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,560
And any warnings about the coming crisis?

331
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
There's, well, you know, I'm not actually getting into this

332
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
in the book.

333
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Okay.

334
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
But your dad actually, this is one of the things,

335
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
there's a few things toward the end of his life, especially,

336
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
that he got wrong quite badly.

337
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Yeah.

338
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
And the financial crisis is one of them.

339
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
He's one of them.

340
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
He really underestimated, there are these emails between him

341
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,560
and McKaylee, where they're kind of talking about how bad the crisis

342
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
is about to be.

343
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
And your dad, again, I'm not getting into this in the book,

344
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,560
because it's not that relevant, but he did misread it.

345
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
And again, it's like a misreading that a lot of people had,

346
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,560
but he predicted, he made very specific predictions about how

347
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
things were going to play out and how bad they were going to be.

348
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
And he was wrong.

349
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,560
But again, the, okay, we're talking about some of the,

350
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,560
so you graduate from college, you moved to New York,

351
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,560
you were taking classes at NYU, we were talking about this yesterday.

352
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
You're not going to like this.

353
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
I'm noting that a number, in fact, I'm saying many of Bill's

354
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
colleagues knew that he had two daughters,

355
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,560
but didn't realize he had a son.

356
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm also noting that you actually had a slightly warmer relationship

357
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,560
with Bill than you did with your mom, who, like,

358
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,560
struck some of your friends and some of the family's friends

359
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,560
as just very icy.

360
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,560
And whereas Bill was really trying to understand your rebelliousness

361
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
and tried to get to know you.

362
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,560
And actually say that you told friends at the time that you felt

363
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,560
like you had been a burden to your mom ever since she fled Ukraine

364
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,560
and why else would she have let you be dumped and fostered here.

365
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,560
That's a direct quote from Matt Goldsboro.

366
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Did you say that?

367
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Okay, so you bounce around.

368
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,560
I don't remember saying that, but it's possible.

369
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Does that sound like an accurate encapsulation of your feelings?

370
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm sure at the time, maybe, yeah.

371
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Okay, so we're going back and I'm talking about some of the jobs

372
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
you haven't mentioned, kitchen nightmares.

373
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,560
What was the thing you told me about yesterday that I didn't realize?

374
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Oh, there's the website thing.

375
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Michael Luton.

376
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Yeah, I had no idea about that.

377
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Big.com, Michael Luton.

378
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
There's a bunch of websites.

379
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,560
But I know that your main passion and obsession and love is music.

380
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,560
And there's Good Time Charlie's, which became Bikini Robot Army.

381
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,560
And the band was basically you and whoever you were jamming with at that moment.

382
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Describing you, he was a talented musician and songwriter

383
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
tapping this deep well of painful memories for inspiration.

384
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,560
The result was mournful, angry, beautiful guitar piano ballads like Hey Mama,

385
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
in 2002.

386
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,560
And then we've got Hey Mama.

387
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Have you listened to Hey Mama?

388
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Hey Mama's a really nice song.

389
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Thank you.

390
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Your music's really good.

391
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,560
I actually, like, not look a smug of your ass.

392
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Oh, thank you.

393
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,560
There's enough fucking smoke in this room anyway.

394
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Okay, we meet...

395
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
It's fake.

396
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
It's vapor.

397
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
It's not smoking in mine.

398
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,560
There's literally, like, he's...

399
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
No, it's fine.

400
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Keep David from sleeping.

401
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
It's fine.

402
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Yeah, exactly.

403
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
It's like coffee.

404
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Right, the coffee.

405
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Oh, good.

406
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Yeah, I need some more of that, too.

407
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Oh, thank you.

408
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Let's see.

409
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Here you go.

410
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Thank you.

411
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Oh, this is, like, real serious.

412
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Sweetheart.

413
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Let's see.

414
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Muah.

415
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Muah.

416
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Let's see.

417
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Okay.

418
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,560
So, Joe Ackerman, we meet.

419
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Oh, Ackerman is the character.

420
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Yeah.

421
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
And I'm not going to bore you with all of this.

422
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
In fact, this section...

423
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
What is important?

424
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Because you go to the bank of Cyprus.

425
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Yeah, I know it's important.

426
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Val, just in the interest of time here, like, there's...

427
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,560
He's a very important character in the book.

428
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
But it's just not...

429
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
There's no point in fact checking that with you, because...

430
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
In Colin?

431
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Colin Fan?

432
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Yeah.

433
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
He's in there, so...

434
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
He's in there, too.

435
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
We talked to...

436
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Fuck, what's his name?

437
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Sabah, capital guy.

438
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
The camera was in there.

439
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Boas, wine soup?

440
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Boas, yeah.

441
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
We talked to him?

442
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Nothing.

443
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
We've talked to him.

444
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Okay.

445
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Because there's an interesting relationship

446
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
between Boas and Colin.

447
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Colin Fan.

448
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah.

449
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Yeah, you've mentioned that.

450
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Yeah.

451
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
There's an interesting relationship between Boas

452
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
and a lot of people.

453
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Boas is...

454
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
My dad really likes him.

455
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
I know he does.

456
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Yeah.

457
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
You've mentioned that.

458
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Oh, Kydoke.

459
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Kydoke?

460
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,560
So I note here at the end of chapter 10

461
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,560
that this is the late odds.

462
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
The late...

463
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Or not the late odds.

464
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
It's like the mid odds.

465
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Okay.

466
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
And this is like a go-go period for the bank.

467
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
And it's actually...

468
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
They don't realize it, but it's spinning out of control.

469
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,560
And the bank desperately needed someone to be there

470
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,560
to say no, and wasn't afraid to give unwanted news.

471
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Someone like Bill.

472
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Okay.

473
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
But Bill wasn't there.

474
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
In fact, Bill was...

475
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
In the months after the Edson died,

476
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
had been very glad that he no longer worked in the bank.

477
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:58,560
He told friends that he just realized that he even came to kind of

478
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,560
view Edson's death as a result of the banking industry in some ways.

479
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Like if he hadn't been so competitive and profit hungry,

480
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
maybe Edson wouldn't have died.

481
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
If Edson hadn't been so profit hungry.

482
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Well, I mean, the way I've got it here is that

483
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,560
like the endless hours, the cutthroat environment, the dubious ethics,

484
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,560
these things hadn't caused Edson's plane to go down.

485
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
But in some ways, if he squinted hard enough,

486
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
perhaps they'd contributed to it.

487
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Maybe he hadn't worked so hard.

488
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Maybe he hadn't worked as hard as his wife would have stayed in London.

489
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
And Edson wouldn't have boarded that fateful flight to Rangeley.

490
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Maybe he wouldn't have owned his own plane.

491
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Maybe he would have enforced a flight commercial.

492
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Or maybe not.

493
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
I like the squinting.

494
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
That's good.

495
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Yeah.

496
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
But Bill told acquaint...

497
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Ladies and gentlemen, that is why David is the writer.

498
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
You see?

499
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
If you squint it, maybe you can see this.

500
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
That's good.

501
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
And I'm not blowing smoke up your ass.

502
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Good.

503
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Come sit down so people can see your beautiful bald head.

504
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Yeah.

505
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
So let me just do this right here.

506
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Off camera first.

507
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Yes.

508
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
So I'll just keep going.

509
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Okay, please go ahead.

510
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
So Bill, obviously not in banking anymore.

511
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Immediate priority is to help Estelle,

512
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
who is, you know, not only heartbroken,

513
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,560
but also ostracized by everyone because, you know,

514
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
she was the mistress.

515
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,560
And so he, Bill, gave her some spending money,

516
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
kept her busy doing odd jobs,

517
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,560
had her fixing up the flat after it caught on fire.

518
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Fire.

519
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

520
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Just some fond anecdotes about Bill that I think you already know.

521
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,560
About how, like, you know, he could be a penny pincher sometimes,

522
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,560
but he was generous when it mattered.

523
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
But he was a penny pincher.

524
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Yeah.

525
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
But he also, like, I'm kind of...

526
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Stop using all those paper towels.

527
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
You only need one sheet of paper towel.

528
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Why are you using four sheets?

529
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
What's wrong?

530
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
It's like me not flushing the toilet in my...

531
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
It's like, yeah.

532
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
I'm shaking water.

533
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
David didn't flush the toilet in his hotel room.

534
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm like, David, flush the toilet because I go in the bathroom.

535
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
If it's...

536
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Yeah, I'm saving water, Val.

537
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I'm an environmentalist, man.

538
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I know.

539
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
That's what I said.

540
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,560
So I'm recounting the anecdote of when some Brookesman family member needed

541
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,560
some sort of expensive medical procedure that wasn't insured,

542
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Bill offered to pay for it.

543
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,560
And when the person resisted and said,

544
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
no, I'm not going to accept your money,

545
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Bill said the person who ever was resisting was a liberal.

546
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,560
And Bill said that if he refused to let him pay,

547
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Bill would instead donate that money to the Republican Party.

548
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
That's about right, yeah.

549
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Bill was bored.

550
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Yeah.

551
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
It was monotonous.

552
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Mm-hmm.

553
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
He bought a dog.

554
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Yeah, lazy.

555
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Started a family foundation.

556
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Yeah.

557
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Went to Vegas with some college buddies.

558
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Mm-hmm.

559
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,560
He sat around puffing his pipe and watching old movies.

560
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,560
He sometimes joined Michael Morandy for tennis in Central Park.

561
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
And...

562
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Turned a couple book clubs, too.

563
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Morandy could see in his friend's eyes that Bill was not very happy.

564
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
No.

565
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
He wrote long letters to newspaper editors that never got published.

566
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
One was published.

567
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
You sure about that?

568
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Yeah, yeah, there was one published in Washington.

569
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
I'll show it to you.

570
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Yeah, send it to me.

571
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
He went to the baths alone.

572
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Yes, yeah.

573
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
And it struck up conversations with the strangers

574
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,560
because he didn't have his best friend to go there with.

575
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
And he drank a lot.

576
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,560
And he diagnosed himself as an alcoholic.

577
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
He...

578
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Some friends who he went out with at the time

579
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,560
said that he would get to a drunk that he puked the next morning.

580
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
You've obviously told me a kind of similar example.

581
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Let's talk about Bob's baths already.

582
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Yeah, that was funny.

583
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Once again, some of Bill's friends...

584
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
But to say you're an alcoholic because you puked...

585
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
He diagnosed himself as an alcoholic.

586
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Yeah, I mean, but that's like...

587
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
I'm not saying he's an alcoholic.

588
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
And he didn't...

589
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
At some point, everyone that's drinking too much said,

590
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm an alcoholic.

591
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
But then...

592
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
As you know from your dad's notes,

593
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
he viewed himself as an alcoholic.

594
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Yeah, I hate that, okay.

595
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
And so did your mom.

596
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
All right.

597
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
So I'm not...

598
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Again, I'm not saying any of that in a pejorative way.

599
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Okay.

600
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Once again, some of his friends wonder if he was depressed.

601
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
One of them, Saman Majd...

602
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Saman...

603
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Was...

604
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,560
This is in emails asking about well-buttern.

605
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Yeah.

606
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
And Bill says, quote,

607
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,560
I'm not at all depressed, just very lazy and sluggish.

608
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Um...

609
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,560
So Stan and Neil calls, lures him back to Meryl.

610
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Um...

611
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,560
He comes on as a consultant.

612
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Doing lots of work.

613
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
Uh...

614
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Describes his nothing too strenuous.

615
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
He describes to his style, actually.

616
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
He's nothing too strenuous,

617
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
but it's fun to be near the game.

618
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Okay.

619
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
We're not the...

620
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Uh...

621
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
What year are we at?

622
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
We're in...

623
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
It's 2004.

624
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Um...

625
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Yeah, 2004-2005.

626
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Um...

627
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Let's see...

628
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Anju, meanwhile, is climbing up the ranks.

629
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,560
He's looking for jobs elsewhere.

630
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,560
And then I go through a bunch of Anju's piranhas,

631
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,560
as one person describes them.

632
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
And let's see...

633
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Let's see...

634
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Okay.

635
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Um...

636
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,560
2007, crisis is bubbling up.

637
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,560
And in August, um...

638
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Actually, in that summer, Stan and Neil

639
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
tries to get Bill to come on as a permanent employee.

640
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Right.

641
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
And they don't.

642
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
He refuses.

643
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
And he just kind of shook his head sadly.

644
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
And Neil said,

645
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
No, I'm not going to do it.

646
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
And that was the last...

647
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
He didn't like his books.

648
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
His derivative books.

649
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
What was that?

650
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
He didn't like his derivative books.

651
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
He didn't like anything.

652
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
He didn't feel like he was being listened to.

653
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
And...

654
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
He felt it wasn't the same Merrill.

655
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
What was that?

656
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
He felt it wasn't the same Merrill Lynch.

657
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Something had gone wrong.

658
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Something had shifted.

659
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Did he say that to you?

660
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Um...

661
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
No, I didn't say it to me directly.

662
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
I don't know if I could sort of feel it.

663
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,560
I mean, even conversations with other people

664
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
and make a piece of it together is that...

665
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,560
You know, it's how he felt.

666
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
I mean, he was always loyal to Merrill Lynch

667
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
because that's what he made his mark.

668
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
Yep.

669
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
It was just kind of heartbreaking for him

670
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,560
to see Merrill Lynch fail.

671
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Um...

672
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Okay, so that August 2007,

673
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Anshu calls

674
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
uh, convinces Bill to come back

675
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
and work as a consultant

676
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
on one condition,

677
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
which is that he doesn't want anyone to report to him.

678
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Anshu agrees.

679
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Um...

680
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Anshu tells someone who he's having lunch with

681
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
there's one thing he learned from Edson

682
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
and that's when the shit hits the fan.

683
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
There's one person you want to stand beside you

684
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
and that's Bill Brooksman.

685
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Yeah.

686
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Um...

687
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
So back they move, Bill and your mom

688
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
move to London.

689
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Uh, the girls and you stay in the States.

690
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Um...

691
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
And he starts advising Anshu

692
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,560
on how to deal with some of the crises he's facing.

693
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,560
One of them immediately is mortgage IT,

694
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
which is this shitty mortgage company

695
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Deutsche Bank had bought the previous year

696
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,560
like the absolute peak of the mortgage market

697
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,560
trying to like get stuff that they could feed into

698
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
the securitization and CDO machine.

699
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Okay.

700
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
And Bill...

701
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Leverage your heavily in debt?

702
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Well, it's just like making bad mortgage loans

703
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
to like subprime customers basically.

704
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Is it predatory?

705
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
I don't know if it's predatory.

706
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
It was certainly the...

707
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
It was definitely making...

708
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,560
It was churning up very risky mortgages

709
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
on kind of false pretenses

710
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,560
and yeah, I guess predatory is probably not a

711
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
bad word to describe it.

712
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Um...

713
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
So he came in to manage this or to...

714
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Well, he came in to advise Anshu on it

715
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,560
and the advice he provided was that...

716
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Was this like a benchmark

717
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,560
or a trigger warning or something for a...

718
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
What's the word?

719
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
It's a red flag for things to come

720
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
and nobody sort of...

721
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Nobody took this as a...

722
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Well, no, I mean at this point things are going pretty bad

723
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
pretty quick.

724
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Yeah, okay.

725
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
We're 2007?

726
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
No.

727
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Yeah, this is like fall of 2007.

728
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Okay.

729
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
And keep in mind just as we're going through this,

730
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
you're getting...

731
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
It's a marker for things to come.

732
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Yeah, but don't think about this in such a literary way

733
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
because, you know,

734
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,560
as a genius literature writer

735
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
as I am,

736
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
you're not...

737
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Yes.

738
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Articulate too.

739
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Well done.

740
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Yes.

741
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
You're not getting like...

742
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
I know.

743
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
You're not getting a feel for it

744
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
because I'm jumping around.

745
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Sure.

746
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,560
And these otherwise will be here.

747
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Yeah, I'm just curious if you're using this

748
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
as like a marker for what's going on.

749
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
No, I'm using this actually as an indication

750
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
of a real, like,

751
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
weighing in on something in a very practical way.

752
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
And basically this business

753
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
that they had just spent half a billion dollars

754
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
on months earlier

755
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
is now, according to Bill, worthless.

756
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Like literally not worth anything.

757
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
And so what do you do with that?

758
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
One option is,

759
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
at the end of the year,

760
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
you write it off entirely

761
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
and acknowledge it's worth zero.

762
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,560
But that means you have to take a huge loss

763
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
and account on the loss anyway.

764
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
That would mean you've recognized

765
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
and you basically take...

766
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Whatever you spent on it,

767
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
you're taking that as a loss now.

768
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
If it's really worth zero.

769
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
In addition to being bad financially,

770
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
this is like really embarrassing.

771
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Sure.

772
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
So Bill comes up with a different solution,

773
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,560
which is that it can basically hover in place

774
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,560
and not do any more risky loans,

775
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
only do good loans,

776
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,560
and that will kind of allow them to be able

777
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,560
to move forward without actually acknowledging

778
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
how bad their investment was.

779
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
So it's kind of a graceful way.

780
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,560
I mean, saying it's kind of paper things over,

781
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
but not in like a bad way.

782
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,560
It's just like...

783
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,560
So he comes back full-time in 2008.

784
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
He's got his obscure title,

785
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
which is head of capital and risk optimization

786
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
for the investment bank.

787
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,560
And so despite the obscure title,

788
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
you know, everyone knew

789
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
if he reported directly to Anshu,

790
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,560
and Anshu like deeply valued his opinion.

791
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
And Anshu could show that

792
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
for all the cowboys we have,

793
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
we also have Bill,

794
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:34,560
the former colleague said.

795
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,560
He starts up weekly risk management meetings,

796
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
which hadn't existed.

797
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,560
He starts like really just like looking

798
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
around these businesses,

799
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
looking, trying to understand them.

800
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,560
And, you know, seeing a lot of problems

801
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
and trying to slowly but surely clean them up.

802
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,560
And this is right as the financial crisis

803
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
is hitting in Deutsche Bank,

804
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
as you probably know,

805
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
is actually a big winner in the crisis,

806
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,560
partly because they had, you know,

807
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,560
they were shorting.

808
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
There's some short all these CDOs,

809
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
which they had actually helped manufacture.

810
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
And so they were,

811
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
and playing both sides of this,

812
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
and it was very profitable for them.

813
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
And that came from that Deutsche Bank guy

814
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
that made quite a good...

815
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Yeah.

816
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
So Greg Lippmann is who you're thinking of,

817
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
who was kind of immortalized in the Big Short.

818
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
You're in Big Short.

819
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Okay.

820
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Okay, we're just going to pause this for a sec and...

821
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Okay.

822
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Are you feeling tired?

823
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
I'm feeling good.

824
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
I mean, this is weird.

825
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Yeah.

826
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
So much.

827
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
So cool.

828
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
It's intense.

829
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Yeah, it's intense.

830
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
And it's like...

831
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Because you kind of have to go

832
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
open everything down.

833
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
Yeah.

834
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
And also, like...

835
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
I mean, I'm telling you everything,

836
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
but I'm also trying to, like...

837
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Be nice to us and this stuff.

838
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Not really.

839
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm just telling you, I just...

840
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
I don't want to let you hear this from anyone else.

841
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Yeah, but...

842
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
For sure.

843
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
That's...

844
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
That's a very good way.

845
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
It'll be worse.

846
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Absolutely.

847
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
That's why I'm doing this.

848
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Yeah.

849
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
It's just...

850
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
The point being, not that I'm not telling you.

851
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
It's intense.

852
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
And I'm just...

853
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm aware of it.

854
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm aware of it.

855
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I'm aware of it.

856
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,560
And also, cognizant of that...

857
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
What is on my computer screen right now?

858
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
It's an obvious...

859
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,560
The book is going to go through a zillion revisions

860
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,560
and changes and edits and restructures

861
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
and things like that.

862
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
So this is all...

863
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
It's all in flux, you know?

864
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,560
And so he's hearing it now.

865
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
You're hearing it now.

866
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Sorry?

867
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Yeah, let's see.

868
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
You ready?

869
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Actually, you know what?

870
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,560
I'm going to drop this with a scoop of steamer.

871
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Greg Lippmann.

872
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Greg Lippmann.

873
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Something Lippmann.

874
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Yeah, so Deutsche Bank was creating these CDOs

875
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
and short-selling their own...

876
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
their own CDOs.

877
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Did you pull that thing?

878
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Yeah.

879
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,560
So they were creating packaging CDOs

880
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
and short-selling them?

881
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
So this is where Fred DePaul's loft came in.

882
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
They would use...

883
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,560
So you take...

884
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,560
So do you want me to just explain this as if you're an idiot?

885
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Yeah, absolutely.

886
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Yeah.

887
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Yeah.

888
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
So...

889
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Okay, so you take a mortgage.

890
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Right.

891
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Take a bunch of it, which is...

892
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Right.

893
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Package that together into a mortgage security.

894
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
Sure.

895
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
You then take a bunch of mortgage securities.

896
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Right.

897
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Mush them together and then like shop them up

898
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
depending on their risk.

899
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Conscious.

900
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Yeah, very good.

901
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Conscious.

902
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
I told you I was going to tell you like you're an idiot

903
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
even though you're not an idiot.

904
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
So the...

905
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
And those are CDOs, right?

906
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Right.

907
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
You then use credit default swaps.

908
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,560
CDS, which are insurance contracts essentially

909
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
to bet against those CDOs.

910
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Right.

911
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
And so Deutsche Bank on the one hand

912
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
was taking all these mortgages,

913
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
some of which they were producing through mortgage IT

914
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
that's coming from what they bought.

915
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Oh, okay.

916
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Packaging those into mortgage-backed securities,

917
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,560
into CDOs, which Greg Lipman's squad was selling

918
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
to dummies all over the world.

919
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Right.

920
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,560
And then simultaneously betting against those very CDOs.

921
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Which is the short sell.

922
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
Which is the short sell.

923
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,560
So they not only are both selling something bad

924
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
and betting that they're going to fail,

925
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
but they also kind of have inside knowledge

926
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
of what's going to do well and what's not going to do well

927
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
because they're fucking mortgages.

928
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Sure.

929
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
So...

930
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Yeah.

931
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Well, they not only packed them, they originated them.

932
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
They were, because of mortgage IT,

933
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
they're actually producing these mortgages

934
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
because they know every step of the process.

935
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I didn't realize that mortgage IT was the conduit.

936
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Well, it was just part of it.

937
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
I mean, I didn't even actually realize that myself

938
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
until recently when I was going through

939
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,560
the huge settlement they had, Deutsche Bank had,

940
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,560
which was last year or the year before last.

941
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,560
And it goes, the Justice Department itself,

942
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
just goes in great detail to the role,

943
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,560
the fraudulent role that mortgage IT played.

944
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,560
And so, well, we'll get to this later,

945
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,560
but that's one of the things,

946
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
I don't know this, I'm just speculating,

947
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
but it's possible that your dad,

948
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,560
given the advice that he had given to Anchu

949
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
about that business and saying,

950
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
don't shut it down, keep it going

951
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
so we don't need to recognize that big loss.

952
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,560
It's not impossible that that was

953
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,560
like a little bit bothersome to people.

954
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Right.

955
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,560
I don't know that, though, that's just pure speculation.

956
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,560
So, okay, crisis ends.

957
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
To not bring mortgage IT to light

958
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
or to sort of give mortgage IT to the past?

959
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
No, it gave it a, yeah, to give it a pass.

960
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
They gave it like another lease on life.

961
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,560
They allowed it to continue operating for a while.

962
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Again, I'm not making much of that

963
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
because I don't really know, but it's...

964
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
That's an interesting idea.

965
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
I mean, with the benefit of hindsight,

966
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
that wasn't the best plan.

967
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Right.

968
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,560
What they came up with, hindsight's 20-20.

969
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Okay, so this is where, starting around 2010,

970
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Deutsche Bank, it's big decline begins.

971
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
So, it survived the crisis better than most

972
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
because Greg Litman and his ilk

973
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
were making billions of dollars

974
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
short in the mortgage market.

975
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,560
And Deutsche Bank executives,

976
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,560
primarily Anchu and Joe Ackerman,

977
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,560
mistook their relative success during the crisis

978
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
as a sign that they were just in the clear.

979
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,560
And they step on the gas.

980
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,560
And Anchu is kind of losing touch with reality.

981
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
It seems like according to a bunch of people

982
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
who worked with him.

983
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,560
And also, they are...

984
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,560
The so-called piranhas around Anchu

985
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
are, no one is paying any attention to them.

986
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,560
So, that includes Christian Bittar,

987
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,560
who is the LIBOR trader.

988
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
It includes...

989
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Call him, can I...

990
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Be patient.

991
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,560
It includes the tax trades that they were doing

992
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
for renaissance.

993
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
The basket options.

994
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
The basket options are good.

995
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,560
And it includes...

996
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,560
It includes Monty Deposky.

997
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
And Kelly Faisola.

998
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Good.

999
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,560
And yeah, it includes these crazed trading floors

1000
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
that Colin Fan is presiding over.

1001
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
So, here's one thing.

1002
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
This is one of the most interesting things

1003
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,560
I think I've found in my reporting.

1004
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,560
It's just an anecdote, but it's a telling one.

1005
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
So, in...

1006
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,560
I'm trying to figure out exactly the date here.

1007
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,560
I think 2010.

1008
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Let's give it a take, 2010.

1009
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,560
There was a trader, a whole group of traders, actually,

1010
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,560
in their bond traders.

1011
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,560
And they were trading on mortgages.

1012
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
But this was after the crisis.

1013
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
So, they were actually betting,

1014
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
whereas Deutsche Bank had made this big short bet

1015
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
against the housing market.

1016
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
The exposition?

1017
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
This was the opposite.

1018
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
So, they were now betting on the housing market

1019
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
to recover.

1020
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
And this guy's name is Troy Dixon.

1021
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
He's like a young guy.

1022
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
And it had a whole group that they were making

1023
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,560
a very big, like multi-billion dollar bet

1024
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,560
the housing market was going to come back to life

1025
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,560
in a big way, which is fine.

1026
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,560
But the bets were really, really big.

1027
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
And so, risk managers started getting very worried.

1028
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
How big?

1029
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Billions.

1030
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
And the risk management team in the investment bank

1031
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
didn't have anywhere to go.

1032
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
No one would listen to their concerns.

1033
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
So, they went to your dad.

1034
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,560
And Bill took a look at...

1035
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
The risk guys had basically compiled a dossier

1036
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
of all this stuff.

1037
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
And so, Bill started going through the dossier

1038
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
and agreed that what they were showing

1039
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
him did not look good.

1040
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,560
It looked like this is just like a gigantic risk.

1041
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,560
So, he went to talk to Troy Dixon's group.

1042
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,560
And Dixon was like, fuck you old man.

1043
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I'm not going to...

1044
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Like, who are you?

1045
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,560
And this went back and forth.

1046
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
They fought.

1047
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Bill went back to the risk managers and said

1048
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
he'd receive a strong pushback, that's a quote,

1049
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,560
from above in the efforts to rein Dixon in.

1050
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Dixon kept...

1051
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Or Bill kept pushing.

1052
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Dixon kept getting angry.

1053
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,560
And without any success, Bill did not manage to corral.

1054
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,560
And he could tell that he was pissing Troy Dixon off.

1055
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
Pissing off his whole group.

1056
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
And so, he tried to patch those up.

1057
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,560
And he invited Dixon and about 10 other traders

1058
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,560
from that desk out to dinner.

1059
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,560
It was an Italian restaurant in Tribeca.

1060
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Large candlelit table.

1061
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Floral tapestries on the wall.

1062
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Okay.

1063
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
So, you went there?

1064
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Yeah.

1065
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,560
So, dinner gets off to an awkward start.

1066
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,560
And Bill and Troy are still bickering about the wisdom

1067
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
of these trades.

1068
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
And neither of them would drop.

1069
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
And Dixon's crew, it's a little posse,

1070
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
is around the hill like kind of snickering at your dad.

1071
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
Snickering at my dad.

1072
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
Snickering.

1073
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
That he's out of his depth.

1074
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
He doesn't understand this stuff.

1075
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Which is crazy.

1076
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Does your father is out of his depth?

1077
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
They don't know who...

1078
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
He wasn't out of their depth.

1079
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,560
These guys are like young, obnoxious.

1080
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
Yeah, they thought right down.

1081
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
They thought they were laughing at him.

1082
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
They were starting to.

1083
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Anyway, they stopped talking about this trades

1084
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
and there's a conversation with me,

1085
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
and there's something else.

1086
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,560
And I don't know.

1087
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,560
I think I'm going to be asking you at one point.

1088
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Do you know who Jerry Sundusky is?

1089
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Did I ask you that?

1090
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Yeah, it's the guy that was molesting people

1091
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
in the showers or something.

1092
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
He was a former college,

1093
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Penn College football coach.

1094
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Yeah.

1095
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Or Penn State College football coach.

1096
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Yeah.

1097
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Or he knew about the other guy.

1098
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Right?

1099
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
There wasn't a documentary.

1100
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Yeah, no, that's Joe Paterno.

1101
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
He's the guy who...

1102
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,560
Now, how is this relevant?

1103
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
You'll see.

1104
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Oh, right, because you didn't know who he was.

1105
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Maybe I've told you some of this before.

1106
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Yeah, and I was texting him for a long time

1107
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
trying to say,

1108
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,560
well, I didn't even know who the guy was

1109
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
until he heard his name.

1110
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Yeah, it's fair enough.

1111
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Bill had never heard of the guy.

1112
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
He had just write them a sentence

1113
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
to at least 30 years in prison

1114
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
for child molestation.

1115
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,560
And someone at the table remarked that

1116
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,560
child molesters in for a tough time in prison.

1117
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
And your dad said,

1118
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
why?

1119
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
And the traitors looked at each other.

1120
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
This dude for real.

1121
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
And someone says,

1122
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,560
finally, you see molested boys.

1123
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
So?

1124
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Why?

1125
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Why is that reason for a tough time?

1126
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,560
And Bill did not get that child molesters

1127
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,560
were like the most hated people in prison.

1128
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
This is like fair enough.

1129
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
Kept asking questions.

1130
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Okay.

1131
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Why?

1132
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
Why?

1133
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Why?

1134
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
And once again, the snickering starts up.

1135
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
They're just fucking laughing at him.

1136
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,560
One of them described it as this old man was clueless.

1137
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Okay.

1138
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
Uh, end of the meal.

1139
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,560
Bill picks up the tab and just bolts.

1140
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,560
He's like, doesn't even really say goodbye.

1141
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,560
He just heads straight for the subway.

1142
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,560
And Troy Dixon and his buddies go back to the bar,

1143
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
go back to a bar,

1144
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
and they just spend the night laughing

1145
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
about how this weird guy,

1146
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,560
like didn't know that Jerry Sandusky doesn't understand prison.

1147
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
And then they went back to work.

1148
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Fuck these guys.

1149
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Fuck these guys.

1150
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
What were they?

1151
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Who cares?

1152
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Well, they were...

1153
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
They were wrong anyway.

1154
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
My dad was right.

1155
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
This is...

1156
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
And he cares if you didn't fucking Jerry Sandusky.

1157
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
I didn't know who he was either.

1158
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,560
And my dad isn't really up to what's going on in the prison world.

1159
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
But I'm pretty sure he was trying to figure out

1160
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
why they're talking about this.

1161
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,560
I mean, I'm sure if he said to my dad,

1162
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,560
at any point in time,

1163
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,560
a child molester would have trouble in prison,

1164
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
he would understand that.

1165
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
That's not something that was over his head.

1166
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,560
But at this, probably the context of this meeting,

1167
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,560
if this is true what they say,

1168
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
he could be either,

1169
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
he's trying to fuck with them

1170
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
or get a read on them,

1171
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
saying why, why, why, over and over

1172
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,560
to see how deeply, deeply moronic these people are

1173
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
to continue this line of questioning,

1174
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,560
to see why he would perceive them to be...

1175
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
Their responses to his why

1176
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
is how he reads other people.

1177
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
My dad was here in the room.

1178
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
And he says,

1179
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
my dad was here in the room

1180
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,560
and he says,

1181
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
why do you want quite an obvious question?

1182
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
He's got to get a read on you.

1183
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
He's not actually asking why.

1184
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Like, the sky's blue, why?

1185
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
He's trying to figure out how you perceive it

1186
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
and what you're...

1187
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
He's trying to get some time

1188
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
to make up his mind about you

1189
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
and he's giving you something to talk about.

1190
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
I think he's pretty much made up his mind

1191
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
before he went out to dinner with these guys.

1192
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,560
He did not like them.

1193
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,560
And I'm not sure that was bad on his part.

1194
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
There's very...

1195
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
My read on this, though,

1196
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,560
is just putting aside what Bill's intent was.

1197
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,560
The reality is that these...

1198
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
It was like a generational shift

1199
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,560
going on in Wall Street

1200
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
and the guys who had grown up

1201
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,560
viewing derivatives as casino instruments

1202
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,560
were on the rise

1203
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,560
and guys like Bill who had grown up

1204
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
viewing them primarily as hedging devices

1205
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
and client-centric devices

1206
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
were on the way out

1207
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,560
and the young guys didn't have any respect

1208
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
for the slightly older guys.

1209
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
That makes sense.

1210
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
But in the anecdote,

1211
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,560
it seems like the takeaway from it

1212
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,560
is that my dad was out of touch.

1213
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,560
No, that's not...

1214
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,560
Because if you're saying,

1215
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,560
why, why, why...

1216
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Trust me, Val, that's not...

1217
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Maybe I'm...

1218
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Well, this is just the danger of doing it this way.

1219
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,560
If I read it, I'm sure...

1220
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,560
This is kind of a sad moment for Bill.

1221
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
Like, there's...

1222
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Why?

1223
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Because you think he's realizing he's out of touch?

1224
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,560
He's realizing that there's been a generational shift.

1225
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
But there's a paradox here

1226
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,560
because yes, he's maybe out of touch

1227
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,560
with what's going on in current events,

1228
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
but he's obviously very much in touch

1229
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
because he's trying to rein in these idiots

1230
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
to stop doing something different.

1231
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,560
Dixon's trades blow up,

1232
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,560
cost Deutsche Bank half a billion dollars,

1233
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,560
and federal regulators start investigating.

1234
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,560
So that was totally right.

1235
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,560
He has the last laugh,

1236
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
but it's just not a very funny laugh

1237
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,560
because people aren't listening.

1238
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,560
And this is a pattern that's about to repeat itself

1239
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
over and over and over again.

1240
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,560
Because people stop listening to him.

1241
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
To this old man from a different era.

1242
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
That makes sense.

1243
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
So you think he felt he was out of touch

1244
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
and he didn't know how to rein in these fools?

1245
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
He didn't know how to rein them in,

1246
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,560
just no one would listen to him.

1247
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
But he didn't have the backing necessary?

1248
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,560
I mean, but he had the power of Deutsche Bank behind him.

1249
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
How could they not rein in Troy Dixon

1250
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,560
and his crew of fucking morons?

1251
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
They weren't morons.

1252
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,560
They were just making a very big, risky bet.

1253
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,560
It sounded pretty moronic to me.

1254
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,560
So, one of the lessons here

1255
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,560
that I've picked up on...

1256
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Sorry, I'm just upset someone's fucking with my dad.

1257
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,560
No, I get it, man.

1258
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,560
And that's the direction you're supposed to have.

1259
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,560
It's a reader you're supposed to have.

1260
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
Yeah.

1261
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,560
They're being...

1262
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
Where you going?

1263
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
I'm just going to put this to charge

1264
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
and have a proper cigarette.

1265
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
One of the big takeaways I have

1266
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
about your dad and his role as a bank

1267
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
is that your dad is like a good man.

1268
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
He's an honest man,

1269
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
makes mistakes like we all do,

1270
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
but he's a good human being.

1271
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,560
But one of the things that

1272
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
there's no way it was not bothering him

1273
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,560
is that his role was changed.

1274
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,560
With Edson, he was like the right-hand man

1275
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,560
who was just

1276
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,560
an integral part of the kind of ecosystem,

1277
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
the functioning.

1278
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
He was the super ego to Edson's id.

1279
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
In the second round at Deutsche Bank,

1280
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,560
he's not bad.

1281
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,560
There is no need for a super ego.

1282
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,560
This bank is out of control.

1283
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Nobody's listening to him.

1284
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
And there is...

1285
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
No one wants to hear bad news anymore.

1286
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,560
No one wants someone to say no.

1287
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,560
They think they're so smart.

1288
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,560
They just surfed through the financial crisis.

1289
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,560
The greatest disruption since the 1920's

1290
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,560
or 1930's.

1291
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,560
They don't need

1292
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,560
Dr. Nell.

1293
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
Right.

1294
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,560
Okay.

1295
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
Anchi becomes CEO.

1296
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
Okay.

1297
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
In 2012.

1298
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
Co-CEO.

1299
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
So the hubris has taken over.

1300
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
The hubris has taken over.

1301
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,560
Okay.

1302
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,560
Okay.

1303
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,560
Anchi is one of his main priorities.

1304
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,560
It's because they got lucky.

1305
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,560
They thought they were smarter than everyone else.

1306
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
One of the chapters right now is titled

1307
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,560
Luck vs. Skill.

1308
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,560
Hey.

1309
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
Good.

1310
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,560
I just predicted that.

1311
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Interesting.

1312
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
Okay.

1313
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Or there while you just directed me toward that.

1314
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,560
Interesting.

1315
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Did I just say that was...

1316
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
We got that on camera.

1317
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,560
I just said

1318
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,560
without knowing anything about what he was saying

1319
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,560
that this bank was lucky

1320
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
but they thought that they were smarter than everyone else.

1321
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,560
David said the next title of the chapter

1322
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,560
is Luck vs. Skill.

1323
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,560
So that's good.

1324
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,560
So as a reader

1325
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
this is good.

1326
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,560
It's interesting.

1327
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
I just want to point that out.

1328
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,560
We got it.

1329
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,560
Saved your posterity on that.

1330
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Yeah.

1331
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
On my iPhone.

1332
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Interesting.

1333
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,560
Okay.

1334
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,560
So here comes an incident that

1335
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,560
you know a bit about

1336
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,560
but I think you'll learn a little bit more.

1337
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,560
So Anchi

1338
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
takes over as CEO

1339
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,560
and wants to fill the place with his loyalists.

1340
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,560
Right.

1341
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,560
Your dad is a loyalist

1342
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,560
or at least that's how he comes to perceive some.

1343
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,560
And so he puts your dad up

1344
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,560
for the job of chief risk officer.

1345
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,560
And he tells Bill

1346
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,560
that it's a perfect fit.

1347
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,560
Like he gets risk management better than anyone else

1348
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,560
on to trust him.

1349
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,560
And it's like a big leap up.

1350
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
He'll go on the Vorstand

1351
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,560
which is the management committee

1352
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
which is like this

1353
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,560
rarefied board that previously

1354
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,560
had been off-limits to anyone who wasn't German.

1355
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,560
And it's a big jump up.

1356
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,560
His friends congratulate him.

1357
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
He and Michael Morandi

1358
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
are just like weird joke

1359
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,560
where Morandi is called monkey business.

1360
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,560
Okay.

1361
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,560
Which is Moran,

1362
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
they would like go out to dinner together

1363
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
and like clumsily hit on waitresses

1364
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,560
and whoever other,

1365
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,560
whatever other women were around

1366
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,560
and like,

1367
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,560
not they're going to do anything

1368
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,560
but just like,

1369
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,560
he's been around.

1370
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,560
And so Morandi,

1371
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,560
when he learned that Bill

1372
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,560
has been put up for this very important job,

1373
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,560
laments that there will be no more monkey business.

1374
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,560
And Deutsche Bank,

1375
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,560
after announcing this to the world,

1376
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
decides that maybe it would be a good idea

1377
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
to check with the German regulators,

1378
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,560
Bafen,

1379
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
over whether this is okay.

1380
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,560
Because Bafen actually has veto power over this.

1381
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
Okay.

1382
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
And Bafen's students over this

1383
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
for a little while.

1384
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,560
Who says to suggest Bafen?

1385
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Deutsche Bank has to submit this

1386
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
to Bafen's approval.

1387
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
They have to.

1388
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560
The reasons that remain unclear,

1389
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,560
they decided it would be smart to announce the job

1390
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,560
before they'd actually sought

1391
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,560
or received approval from the regulators.

1392
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Okay.

1393
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Not smart.

1394
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,560
No.

1395
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,560
Bafen already was very troubled but on to

1396
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,560
and concerned about his recklessness

1397
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
and his lack of management savvy

1398
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,560
and perceived on to as putting into

1399
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,560
arguably the most important job in the bank,

1400
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,560
Chief Risk Officer,

1401
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,560
one of his kind of flak flunkies.

1402
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,560
So they consider my dad a flunky to answer?

1403
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,560
Yes.

1404
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,560
They perceive that way.

1405
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
What about Ackerman?

1406
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Well, Ackerman's gone at this point.

1407
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
Oh.

1408
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,560
He stepped down.

1409
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,560
So, in fact,

1410
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Bill wonders to his friend,

1411
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
so Bafen rejects it.

1412
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
It's a very embarrassing situation for him.

1413
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,560
He's been given this big promotion.

1414
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,560
Wait, we're in 2012.

1415
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,560
In 2012.

1416
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,560
Okay.

1417
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,560
He gets this big promotion,

1418
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,560
huge promotion.

1419
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,560
It's all like newspapers write stories about it.

1420
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
The FT did a lot on it.

1421
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
They write the journal too.

1422
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,560
And then it gets rescinded.

1423
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,560
Right.

1424
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
And so Bill wonders to his friends and colleagues

1425
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
that he speculates that perhaps he was just

1426
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
a victim of sabotage.

1427
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,560
And maybe Ackerman had basically

1428
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,560
stabbed him in the back with the regulators

1429
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,560
because he wanted,

1430
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,560
Ackerman wanted to hurt Anshu.

1431
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,560
In any case,

1432
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,560
he'd been receiving all these congrats

1433
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,560
and throwing emails and phone calls all month

1434
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,560
and now he has to go back to people over and over

1435
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,560
and explain that the job has been revoked.

1436
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,560
Okay.

1437
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,560
Easy come, easy go,

1438
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,560
was the voicemail he left for his mother.

1439
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,560
And he sounds nonchalant,

1440
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,560
but when Pete, his brother,

1441
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,560
listens...

1442
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,560
Peter.

1443
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
I call him Peter.

1444
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
It's Peter.

1445
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
No one calls him Peter.

1446
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,560
It's written Peter.

1447
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,560
I'm just reading with notches.

1448
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,560
Okay.

1449
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
When Peter listens to the message,

1450
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,560
you can tell that he says

1451
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,560
there's no concealing the hurt in his voice.

1452
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
Really?

1453
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,560
I don't know.

1454
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
I remember he told me.

1455
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,560
It didn't seem...

1456
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,560
I don't think that is what he told you.

1457
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
We'll get to that in a second.

1458
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Oh.

1459
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
I mean, when he told me,

1460
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
I didn't take up any...

1461
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,560
Well, he didn't...

1462
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,560
We'll get to it.

1463
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
He told you an email.

1464
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,560
Sorry?

1465
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,560
He told you in an email how he felt.

1466
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
So we'll get to that in a second.

1467
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,560
No, he told me over dinner.

1468
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
We'll get to it in a second.

1469
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,560
I'll read it to you.

1470
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,560
He told Sam

1471
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,560
that he felt insulted.

1472
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
He told John Bright

1473
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,560
the particle physicist from Merrill

1474
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,560
that he knew he should be relieved.

1475
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
But once I quote...

1476
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,560
But once I started thinking about the job,

1477
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,560
I liked it.

1478
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Miranda joked,

1479
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,560
we're back in the monkey business.

1480
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,560
Bill laughed and looked sad.

1481
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,560
And then, at the end of the year,

1482
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,560
this pattern defeated itself

1483
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,560
because Bill was put up for another senior job

1484
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,560
running the non-core unit at Deutsche Bank.

1485
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,560
And once again,

1486
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Boppen shot it down after it had been announced.

1487
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,560
So this is around the time that Bill,

1488
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,560
as a consolation prize,

1489
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,560
gets put on DBTCA's board.

1490
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,560
So we've got a bunch of DBTCA history here.

1491
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,560
And he felt he was being set up now at this point.

1492
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,560
He didn't really feel he was being set up.

1493
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,560
He felt like he needed to...

1494
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,560
There was some concern over him feeling set up

1495
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
for what was about to happen at Deutsche Bank

1496
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,560
according to the therapist.

1497
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,560
I don't think that's quite right.

1498
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
There's to be a fall guy, in a sense.

1499
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,560
I think he...

1500
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,560
Because he saw what was coming.

1501
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,560
I don't think he saw what was coming.

1502
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,560
I think he viewed...

1503
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,560
What do you mean there's the DOJ investigations?

1504
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,560
We'll get there. Don't worry. I promise you.

1505
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,560
There's a DOJ investigation involved in your dad?

1506
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,560
You're the one that told me that.

1507
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,560
I'm kidding, man. God!

1508
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,560
Monty, okay.

1509
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,560
Just be patient.

1510
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,560
Allow me my narrative pasting.

1511
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,560
So, what we do know about Bill at that point

1512
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,560
is that he views...

1513
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,560
Allow me my narrative pasting.

1514
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,560
He feels like

1515
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,560
he is kind of being wedged into a doubly.

1516
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,560
He doesn't really want,

1517
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
but he's just been publicly humiliated twice.

1518
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
Yeah.

1519
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,560
And this is kind of face-saving

1520
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,560
and it's some way to get a little bit of lost status back.

1521
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,560
Yeah, that's right.

1522
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,560
He's not getting...

1523
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,560
I mean, he's getting paid a lot by human standards,

1524
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,560
but not by bankers.

1525
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,560
It's an extra hundred grand.

1526
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,560
So, around that time,

1527
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,560
Bill and

1528
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,560
Aala reconnect with Scott Mitchell.

1529
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,560
Do you know Scott Mitchell?

1530
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,560
Yeah, he's come a few times.

1531
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,560
He's Edson's son.

1532
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,560
Right.

1533
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,560
And they hadn't seen each other in a decade,

1534
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,560
but in 2012,

1535
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,560
Scott happened to sit down for lunch

1536
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,560
or something with Anshu.

1537
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,560
Anshu pushed the two of them to...

1538
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,560
pushed the Mitchell and Brooks McClanns

1539
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,560
to like...

1540
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,560
because they'd been...

1541
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
there's a huge following up

1542
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,560
because Bill and Aala had supported...

1543
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,560
Estelle.

1544
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,560
Estelle, which, you know,

1545
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,560
not surprisingly,

1546
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,560
Susan and her kids

1547
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,560
viewed as a betrayal.

1548
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,560
Right.

1549
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,560
And Scott is...

1550
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
both Bill and Scott

1551
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
agree to a meeting.

1552
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
They book reservations for lunch

1553
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,560
and then they keep...

1554
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,560
each of them keeps canceling.

1555
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,560
Right.

1556
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,560
And finally,

1557
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
they get thanks to some product

1558
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
from Bill's assistant.

1559
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,560
They finally, like, plan for lunch.

1560
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,560
And they go to a Japanese restaurant

1561
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
in Union Square, 15 East.

1562
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,560
And Alessa went to dinner.

1563
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,560
Okay.

1564
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,560
And so did Scott's sister.

1565
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,560
So it was Bill, Alessa, Scott,

1566
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,560
and Scott's sister, Ella.

1567
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,560
Okay.

1568
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,560
12 years since they'd seen each other.

1569
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,560
And Scott, at this point,

1570
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,560
is like a spitting image of Edson.

1571
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,560
And Alessa blurts out

1572
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,560
the moment they see him.

1573
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,560
He's Edson.

1574
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,560
Holy shit.

1575
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,560
Scott, who's a little bit drunk

1576
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,560
because he had been so nervous

1577
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
and would, like, just drink a bunch

1578
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,560
before dinner.

1579
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
You know, sitting down,

1580
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
they're both...

1581
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Scott's sweating profusely.

1582
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,560
And your dad ordered some nice wine.

1583
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,560
The more they drank,

1584
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
the more things calmed down,

1585
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,560
the more fun they're having.

1586
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,560
Scott does his...

1587
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,560
his arm show impersonation.

1588
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,560
You are smarter than hell and talented.

1589
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
How do we get you up to your metrics?

1590
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560
Scott, by the way, is a used car salesman

1591
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,560
at that point.

1592
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,560
That's a horrible accent, isn't it?

1593
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
No, that's good.

1594
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,560
Bill loves it.

1595
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,560
Laughing.

1596
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,560
They're bantering about banking.

1597
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Dinner ends.

1598
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,560
And Alessa takes the sister aside.

1599
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,560
The Scott's sister aside and says,

1600
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
this is him looking at pointing

1601
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,560
at your dad's direction.

1602
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,560
I haven't seen my father like this

1603
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,560
since Edson.

1604
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,560
End of that summer, Bill,

1605
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,560
and I'll invite Scott up to the house in Brooklyn.

1606
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,560
I spent the day drinking and reminiscing.

1607
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,560
And Bill joked about how he dodged a bullet

1608
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,560
by not getting the chief risk officer job.

1609
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,560
He tells Scott that he's about to retire,

1610
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,560
thinking about retiring for a final time.

1611
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,560
He keeps saying how much he misses Edson.

1612
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,560
And he keeps asking Scott for a state planning advice.

1613
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
For a state planning advice.

1614
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
Yes, Scott was mystified by that because...

1615
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,560
2012?

1616
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,560
This is summer 2012.

1617
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,560
Scott asked Bill,

1618
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,560
what would have happened if with Deutsche,

1619
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,560
Edson hadn't died?

1620
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
It would be a better worship.

1621
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,560
We would have made less money during the boom,

1622
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,560
but we would have lost less money

1623
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,560
during the bust, he said.

1624
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,560
Hmm.

1625
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,560
February 2013,

1626
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,560
annual bonuses get handed out.

1627
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,560
Bill asks Anchu for a private meeting.

1628
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,560
Tells Anchu that he's going to retire again.

1629
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,560
He's tired, he's deflated.

1630
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,560
He just wants it out.

1631
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,560
Anchu is laid,

1632
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,560
there's a million different fires burning inside Deutsche Bank right then.

1633
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,560
He convinces your dad to stick around

1634
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,560
for several more months.

1635
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,560
The...

1636
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,560
And there's like everywhere you look,

1637
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,560
there's scandals, everything,

1638
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,560
all the shoes sitting in the family right now.

1639
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,560
Well,

1640
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,560
I mean, today it's a bit worse.

1641
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,560
I mean, where were the scandals at the time?

1642
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,560
There were a lot of scandals.

1643
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,560
Libor?

1644
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,560
Libor,

1645
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,560
Russian merit trading was just bubbling up.

1646
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
Okay.

1647
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,560
There was a tally that the bank did

1648
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,560
that identified...

1649
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,560
I'm trying to find this number.

1650
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,560
The stress test,

1651
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,560
or before the stress test?

1652
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,560
The stress test was beginning the problem.

1653
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,560
There were,

1654
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,560
in the first eight months of 2013,

1655
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,560
there were 5,777 requests

1656
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
for information from regulators,

1657
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,560
which is about one per hour

1658
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,560
on average,

1659
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,560
and that's a very, very bad sign.

1660
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,560
Okay.

1661
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,560
There's...

1662
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,560
The net tech, basket trees.

1663
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,560
Yeah, the Fed is furious,

1664
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,560
the CFTC is furious,

1665
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,560
the SEC is investigating.

1666
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,560
So it's bubbling.

1667
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Justice Department is starting

1668
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
a bunch of investigations.

1669
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,560
It's bubbling at this point.

1670
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,560
It hasn't really come to fruition.

1671
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,560
It's...

1672
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,560
their offices are being raided by police.

1673
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,560
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1674
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,560
It's pretty bad.

1675
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,560
But you're right, it does get worse.

1676
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,560
So...

1677
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,560
Oh, look.

1678
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,560
We switched back to Val for a second.

1679
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Oh, joy.

1680
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,560
Val possessed a man of charisma,

1681
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,560
and he charmed his way into recording studios

1682
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,560
and meetings with music industry professionals.

1683
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,560
His catalogue of the songs expanded.

1684
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,560
He got gigs.

1685
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,560
It's less lonely with an audience, he told me.

1686
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
Did you see that?

1687
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,560
Yep.

1688
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,560
2008, Urban Plaza.

1689
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,560
You meet Jenny,

1690
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,560
selling merchandise up front.

1691
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,560
Yeah.

1692
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,560
Start dating, she's from New York.

1693
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,560
Moved to London,

1694
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,560
two bedroom flat in Pentishtown.

1695
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,560
Yeah.

1696
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,560
Good.

1697
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,560
Your parents paid the rent

1698
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,560
and distributed roughly 50 grand a year.

1699
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,560
Is that right?

1700
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,560
It was...

1701
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
The rent?

1702
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,560
I mean, including the rent?

1703
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,560
No, not including the rent.

1704
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,560
Oh, yeah, it's about $50,000.

1705
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,560
I'm noting that

1706
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,560
you really wanted your dad to respect

1707
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,560
and that you want to please your dad

1708
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,560
because that's normal.

1709
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,560
Of course.

1710
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,560
Yeah, and it's nothing bad.

1711
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,560
But he also viewed it as the more...

1712
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,560
the more he viewed you as responsible,

1713
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,560
the more he would trust you.

1714
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,560
And there was...

1715
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,560
I'm mentioning this...

1716
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,560
I think this was...

1717
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,560
What's the film producer again?

1718
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,560
What's his name?

1719
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,560
Lawrence.

1720
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,560
No.

1721
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,560
Jerecki.

1722
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Jerecki.

1723
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,560
So you told Jerecki...

1724
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,560
I guess I'm also trying to...

1725
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,560
So you propose investment from your dad

1726
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,560
into Jerecki's business.

1727
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,560
And you say to Jerecki?

1728
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,560
I guess I'm also trying to prove to him

1729
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,560
that I can make sound and confident choices with money.

1730
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,560
Yeah, I know this was a...

1731
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,560
David Gran.

1732
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,560
I was trying to put Jerecki with David Gran

1733
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,560
for his other book before it was made into...

1734
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,560
Velocity of Z.

1735
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,560
So I was trying to put those two together

1736
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,560
and then Jerecki wanted something about this...

1737
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,560
You have the email, right?

1738
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,560
It should all be in that email.

1739
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,560
I've got the email.

1740
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,560
And I was trying to put my dad in the middle too.

1741
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,560
But yeah, it sounds about right.

1742
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,560
I mean, close enough.

1743
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,560
So we begin to hear a little bit

1744
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,560
about your dad's view of you and money.

1745
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,560
Okay.

1746
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,560
Enjoy, yes.

1747
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,560
You're nuts.

1748
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,560
Earn more...

1749
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,560
Sorry.

1750
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,560
You're nuts.

1751
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Earn some money, he told you.

1752
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,560
When you're asked for your stipend to be increased.

1753
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,560
Yes.

1754
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:35,560
Another time your allowance was frittered away somehow

1755
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,560
and you...

1756
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,560
He moved on to a weekly payment plan instead of a monthly.

1757
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,560
Yeah, that was a terrible idea.

1758
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,560
And I know that Bill, like, was pretty short with you sometimes.

1759
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,560
Yeah.

1760
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,560
If you meant to annoy, you succeeded.

1761
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,560
Yeah.

1762
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,560
I told you I'm on occasion.

1763
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,560
I'm not sure you're gonna like this part.

1764
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,560
I'm noting that you had an unkempt beard

1765
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,560
and while your shoulder length hair was mingy on the sides,

1766
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,560
the top was as bald as a coot.

1767
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,560
It's not that bald.

1768
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,560
It's pretty fucking tall.

1769
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,560
I mean, come on.

1770
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,560
There's still some...

1771
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,560
That's about as bald as a coot.

1772
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,560
Some strands.

1773
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,560
Some strands.

1774
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,560
Is that what you're gonna call that?

1775
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,560
Some strands left.

1776
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,560
I'm saying that your clothes were old and tattered

1777
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,560
and your friends didn't think they were very stylish.

1778
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Quote, he looked like a right tramp.

1779
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,560
One of your...

1780
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
Who was this?

1781
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,560
This was Simon Saren.

1782
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,560
Simon said that a fucker.

1783
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,560
Okay.

1784
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,560
He said you push, push, push some more.

1785
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,560
That friends could tell that you had money,

1786
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,560
they didn't quite know where it came from.

1787
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,560
You would say your mom was an artist

1788
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,560
and your dad was a math guy,

1789
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,560
something about algorithms.

1790
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,560
I never said that.

1791
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,560
Well, that sounds about right.

1792
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,560
I said my dad was a banker.

1793
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,560
He was a math guy.

1794
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,560
I mean, he was a math guy.

1795
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,560
That's not inaccurate.

1796
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,560
It was just vague.

1797
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,560
Why would I hide that he's a banker?

1798
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,560
Well, that was actually interesting.

1799
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,560
I talked to Simon about that.

1800
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,560
I asked him that very question.

1801
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:14,560
And he said it's just not like a good look in London

1802
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,560
at that point to be...

1803
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,560
A banker's son?

1804
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,560
Yeah.

1805
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,560
Not a good look.

1806
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,560
Anyway, he told me a story.

1807
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,560
It sounds like Simon created his own sort of story.

1808
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,560
This is kind of going to hurt your street cred.

1809
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,560
Oh, my street cred.

1810
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,560
Don't have street cred.

1811
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,560
Okay.

1812
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,560
Well, not for long.

1813
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,560
So Simon agreed to do like a photo shoot

1814
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,560
for a Bikini Roulette Army cover, album cover.

1815
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
Agreed.

1816
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,560
Or offered or whatever.

1817
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,560
Okay.

1818
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,560
And what he offered was to help make over your wardrobe

1819
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,560
and get proper clothes for this.

1820
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,560
Right.

1821
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,560
And he says that you suggested they go to Harrod's.

1822
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,560
He said bloody hell and took you to Camden Market.

1823
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,560
That's right.

1824
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,560
That's true.

1825
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,560
I didn't know.

1826
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,560
I thought Harrod's had some cool shit.

1827
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,560
What's wrong with Harrod's?

1828
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,560
I don't know, man.

1829
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,560
It's not as cool as Camden Market,

1830
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,560
but Harrod's still nice.

1831
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,560
If I had a choice between Harrod's and Camden Market,

1832
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,560
would you go to Harrod's or Camden Market?

1833
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,560
It depends what look that I try to fill off.

1834
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,560
I wouldn't go to either, to be honest.

1835
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,560
I would go to the Gap.

1836
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,560
To the Gap.

1837
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,560
So that's a sign of my fashion sense.

1838
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,560
Okay.

1839
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,560
So I'm telling the story of how you and Beth met.

1840
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,560
Yes.

1841
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,560
At a party in 2011.

1842
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,560
Yes.

1843
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,560
She saw you across the room.

1844
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,560
There was something magnetic about you.

1845
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
She needed to know who this cocky guy was.

1846
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,560
So sweet.

1847
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,560
She walked over and started talking.

1848
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,560
She's captivated, so confident, so brash, so American.

1849
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,560
Come on, dear.

1850
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,560
Cheesy.

1851
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,560
Cheesy.

1852
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,560
You made a crack about how she looked just like Patty Boyd.

1853
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,560
She knew who Patty Boyd was,

1854
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,560
but she was very flattered and she got on and googled it.

1855
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,560
And by the following spring, so we're in 2012 now,

1856
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,560
Jenny's had a picture and you and Beth are living together.

1857
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,560
Yes.

1858
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,560
She realized that you were a hoarder.

1859
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,560
A hoarder.

1860
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,560
A hoarder.

1861
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,560
Years worth of junk.

1862
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,560
Ticket stubs, tattered artwork, both clothes.

1863
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,560
Occupying every drawer and shelf in the apartment.

1864
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,560
What?

1865
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,560
That's not true at all.

1866
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,560
No?

1867
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,560
That's maybe for books.

1868
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,560
I kept all these books, but I threw a lot of shit away.

1869
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,560
Okay.

1870
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,560
I need to see it.

1871
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,560
Wow.

1872
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,560
Excuse me.

1873
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,560
No.

1874
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,560
Wow.

1875
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,560
Amazing.

1876
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,560
I did not throw...

1877
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,560
There were some things I did not throw away.

1878
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,560
I reluctantly corroborate.

1879
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,560
But not a hoarder.

1880
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,560
Because images...

1881
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,560
It's a businessman.

1882
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,560
When I think of a hoarder, I see that images on television with people stacking up piles

1883
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,560
in these papers.

1884
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,560
That's not...

1885
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,560
Well, we can set up.

1886
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,560
I mean, I don't know.

1887
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,560
It's a majority.

1888
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,560
I mean, it's not a compliment.

1889
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,560
He's absolutely a hoarder, isn't he?

1890
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,560
You're not.

1891
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,560
Thank you.

1892
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,560
I'm highly confident in the accuracy of that description.

1893
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,560
She's not exaggerating.

1894
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,560
Yeah.

1895
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,560
Good.

1896
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,560
Here you go, buddy.

1897
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,560
I'm just trying to find another pack of cigarettes.

1898
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,560
Here it is.

1899
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,560
He's actually a very hoarder.

1900
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,560
He's got, like, city tickets.

1901
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,560
But he doesn't have stacks of newspapers.

1902
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,560
Yeah.

1903
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,560
He keeps every cinema ticket, every note.

1904
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,560
It's amazing.

1905
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,560
Well, hey, it's a good way to jog your memory.

1906
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,560
It's a very good way.

1907
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,560
Yeah.

1908
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,560
It's a good way.

1909
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,560
She says it is fondly, by the way.

1910
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,560
Okay.

1911
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,860
She wanted to do things like cook dinner and go out on dates and explore London in the

1912
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,560
daylight with her boyfriend.

1913
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:49,560
Believe it or not, your sleeping habits were not conducive to that, which is maybe a little

1914
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,560
frustrating to her.

1915
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:59,020
One of the things that surprised her about you was that you, at first glance, came across

1916
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:04,020
to her as this brash, charismatic, hyper-confident American.

1917
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,100
And I think maybe I've told you about this.

1918
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:11,860
She found you to be extremely anxious, sometimes tongue-tied, by anxiety before performances.

1919
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:19,740
And she gave me a specific example of a performance at the 100 Club on Oxford Street, where you

1920
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:26,400
wrapped up your set, then shouted into the microphone, someone needs to call me an ambulance.

1921
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,960
And the crowd looked at you silently, not clear, or not sure if you were serious or not.

1922
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,160
And then you fled offstage.

1923
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,480
And Beth, rushed backstage, thinking you were having some sort of breakdown, can't find

1924
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:45,440
you, spent a while exploring the labby runth of, I guess, is that club's underground area.

1925
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,720
And eventually, leaves me, she can't find you.

1926
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:54,960
And there, on the sidewalk, you're sitting there sweating, panicked, and unable to speak,

1927
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,960
she says.

1928
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,480
And I thought I was going to die.

1929
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,480
Why?

1930
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,360
Lane, Lane Hines was playing with me, and Lane had a party the night before.

1931
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,320
So, well, actually, Lane wasn't scheduled to play with you, I was supposed to play alone,

1932
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,800
but we went to Lane's house, we had a party, we were up all night, a lot of cocaine, a lot

1933
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,800
of cocaine.

1934
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,800
And we did not sleep.

1935
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,520
And then sometime around 7am, he said, Lane, why don't you join me on stage?

1936
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,920
He's like, OK, it's cocaine conversation.

1937
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,520
And then we just decided not to sleep and stay up to the show.

1938
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,240
So we get to the hunter club, like, at night, cooked up out of our heads with the guitars.

1939
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:35,560
And then I start performing, and I was so exhausted, and then not only the anxiety from

1940
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,320
playing mixed with the cocaine, mixed with the no sleep, I thought I was going to die

1941
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,320
at the last song.

1942
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,320
Like, I was singing.

1943
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,240
I didn't think I was going to finish the song.

1944
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,920
And so I thought I was going to fall right off the fucking stage and die.

1945
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:47,920
So he said, call me an ambulance.

1946
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,920
And I was dead serious.

1947
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,920
I thought I was going to die.

1948
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,120
So I had to go outside and catch my breath and calm down and relax.

1949
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
It's terrible.

1950
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,120
Well, that matches up pretty well.

1951
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,120
Yeah.

1952
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,120
That's your perspective.

1953
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,120
I've now got both perspectives of them.

1954
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,120
They mesh.

1955
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,120
So you and Bill go to Wimbledon.

1956
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:16,120
June 2013, lovely picture of you guys together there.

1957
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,120
Faded Giants hat that couldn't corral your long hair.

1958
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,720
Half button denim shirt that exposed your chest.

1959
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:30,420
Your bearded face projecting too cool for school detachment.

1960
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:41,920
You at one point asked Bill, asked your dad, say, tell me about work, and he didn't answer.

1961
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:51,720
I'm noting, let's say, going into that suicide at the Swiss insurance company where Ackerman

1962
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,720
had gone on to.

1963
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,720
The double murder suicide?

1964
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,720
No.

1965
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,720
No, that's a different one.

1966
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:04,320
This is the one in fall of 2013, and your dad and some of his friends afterwards are

1967
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,840
emailing about this one and saying it doesn't look too good for Ackerman because this guy

1968
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,160
had just hung himself and left a suicide note that blamed Ackerman for putting too much

1969
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,160
pressure on him.

1970
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,160
Did it?

1971
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,160
Yeah.

1972
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,160
I didn't know this.

1973
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,160
That's public.

1974
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,160
I didn't know that.

1975
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,160
What did they not say?

1976
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,160
Do you have it in there?

1977
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,160
I don't.

1978
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:30,360
Ackerman then resigned from that company and said, I have reason to believe that the families

1979
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,640
of the opinion that I should take my share of responsibility.

1980
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,800
He later told someone that a certain amount of pressure or occasional factual criticism

1981
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,280
were perfectly normal in such positions.

1982
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,000
They did not even begin to justify suicide.

1983
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I remember this.

1984
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yes.

1985
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Okay.

1986
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,640
The wife had done a campaign.

1987
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,640
The wife blamed him.

1988
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,640
Yes.

1989
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,640
Yes.

1990
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,640
Okay.

1991
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,640
So Bill retires.

1992
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,640
His official last day of work is August 31st.

1993
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:02,160
You asked him why he was quitting, and he says, quote, there is really no logical next

1994
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,520
step for me at DB after board appointment fell through, which is fine.

1995
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,240
I lasted a lot longer than I thought I would.

1996
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:15,080
Anshu hosts a lunch for him with about a dozen people.

1997
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:19,640
He gave a little speech, toasted Bill for his work.

1998
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,320
Afterwards Bill, you welcome to thank him.

1999
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,920
It's a very nice thing.

2000
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,920
You know it.

2001
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,680
Anshu responds, you've made a very important contribution to this institution and to many

2002
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,680
lives.

2003
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,680
Thanks.

2004
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,680
Let's stay in touch.

2005
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,680
Would you kind of stiffen a slightly distant tone?

2006
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:39,680
Well, it's meant for, you know, it's not like a personal note.

2007
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,680
No, it was.

2008
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,680
These are personal emails.

2009
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,680
Oh, that's all I can say.

2010
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,680
He turns 58.

2011
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,680
Oh, this is the email I sent you?

2012
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,680
This is stuff I've gotten from you, yeah.

2013
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,680
That I sent you?

2014
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:54,680
Okay.

2015
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,680
The only person who's been sending me Bill Brooksman's emails.

2016
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,680
Okay.

2017
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,680
Right.

2018
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,680
I just, for never mind.

2019
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,680
Sorry.

2020
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:09,680
They plan to stay in London another year and do some traveling.

2021
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,680
I'm getting into just some of that.

2022
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,680
Oh, noting that they made plans to go to South Africa and then Iran the following spring of

2023
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,680
2014.

2024
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,680
Great.

2025
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,680
Bill tries to learn a little French.

2026
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,680
He takes some writing classes.

2027
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,680
He prefers to get his driver's license, experiments in the kitchen.

2028
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,680
He's enjoying being very lazy and unproductive.

2029
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,680
He writes to a former colleague.

2030
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,680
He finds himself drinking more and more.

2031
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:40,680
Thanksgiving of 2013, he and his mom fly back to New York.

2032
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:46,680
Bill goes to lunch with Saman Maj, who, you know, is net by this point a finance professor

2033
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,680
at Yale.

2034
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,680
And Bill complains that he's missing his job.

2035
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,680
The mark is the adrenaline, the challenge.

2036
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,680
He asks Saman, how do you manage it?

2037
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,680
Don't you miss it?

2038
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,680
And it, Maj says he's found fulfillment in academia and suggests that Bill finds something

2039
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,680
to do with his life.

2040
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Instead, Bill remains very immersed, as you know, in DBTCA.

2041
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:15,680
And it, which is engulfed in, like, rapidly expanding series of problems.

2042
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,680
They don't even have a CFO.

2043
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,680
They're kind of whitewashing these fed stress tests.

2044
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:30,680
He pushes, as you know, your dad pushes a lot to, you know, take things more seriously

2045
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,680
and, like, get up to speed.

2046
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,680
That does not really seem to be working very well.

2047
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,680
Like, no one seems to be taking it all that seriously.

2048
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:49,680
And, okay, December 2013, you meet your parents for sushi.

2049
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:53,680
And this is where we get into the U.S.

2050
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,680
He asks you what your long-term plans are for all the music.

2051
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:01,680
He says how much it would cost to, like, do it all.

2052
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:06,680
And for a glorious moment, you think your dad's about to offer to bankroll all of them.

2053
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,680
Instead, he asks how you'll support yourself when he's gone.

2054
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,680
You ask, are you sick?

2055
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:18,680
Well, I made a joke, too, because I didn't want him to think that I was giving a number to bankroll it.

2056
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,680
So it's not exactly...

2057
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,680
I'm not suggesting at all that you're like money broke.

2058
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,680
No, I made a specific joke.

2059
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,680
I said $1 billion, because I didn't want him to think that I was, like...

2060
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,680
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

2061
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,680
You say, are you sick?

2062
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,680
He shakes his head.

2063
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,680
Ola answers, your father is fine.

2064
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,680
Right.

2065
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,680
A week or two later, you and Beth go out to dinner with them.

2066
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:51,680
That's when you give the Steve Miller band anthology and the record player, which Ola did not like.

2067
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,680
There's a gospel choir singing in the restaurant.

2068
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,680
Yeah, that's right.

2069
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:03,680
Your dad had actually a really engaging conversation about pop music, which seemed out of character for him, but interesting.

2070
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,680
Yeah.

2071
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,680
At the end of the dinner, he hugged you.

2072
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:12,680
This is an unusual display of physical affection and says, I love you very much.

2073
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,680
Hand to a holiday card.

2074
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,680
Enjoy the holidays here and we'll see you in January.

2075
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:22,680
In front of the car, there is a picture of Daisy that Ola had drawn.

2076
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:29,680
This little card is blue and white, except for the dog's red leash.

2077
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,680
Huh.

2078
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,680
Okay.

2079
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,680
That month...

2080
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,680
I didn't pick up on that.

2081
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,680
Is that right?

2082
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,680
Take a look.

2083
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,680
Yeah, I did see it again.

2084
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,680
It's the only thing that stands out in the card is the red leash.

2085
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,680
It does, right?

2086
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,680
Yep.

2087
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,680
Do you have it?

2088
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,680
Yeah, I send it to him.

2089
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,680
I don't know if he sent it to me or if he showed it to me.

2090
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,680
Yeah, he must have sent it to me.

2091
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,680
I took a picture of it and emailed it to you.

2092
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,680
Yeah.

2093
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,680
Yeah.

2094
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,680
Wow.

2095
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,680
I didn't even miss that.

2096
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,680
That's pretty quick.

2097
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,680
Yeah.

2098
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,680
Good catch.

2099
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:15,680
So that month, one afternoon, Bill arranged to meet up with Martin Luft, who was his partner back in the olden days at Deutsche Bank,

2100
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,680
the guy, the military guy.

2101
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,680
Some people thought he was a special forces.

2102
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,680
And they agreed to meet at Gales.

2103
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:26,680
Gales, that big chain of little cafes and coffee shops in London.

2104
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,680
Barely.

2105
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:31,680
It was kind of a fixture in my neighborhood anyway.

2106
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,680
And also in Chelsea.

2107
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,680
And Bill shows up in his gym clothes.

2108
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,680
He just came from the gym.

2109
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,680
He's sweaty.

2110
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,680
And so he's sitting in the crowded cafe reminiscing.

2111
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:49,680
And Loat has been, he gave up on the banking industry and is kind of telling Bill about how he's just like happier than he's ever been in his life.

2112
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:58,680
He's got like a small house now and he goes to pub quizzes and jogs and skis and just things are simpler.

2113
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:03,680
Tries to get your dad enthusiastic about this new phase of his retirement.

2114
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:09,680
And Loat can tell that Bill is just like dwelling on things.

2115
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,680
And at one point he says to Loat that he's wrestling with a problem.

2116
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,680
And he says the bank had done a trade with a client.

2117
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,680
The client hadn't fully understood what he'd been getting into.

2118
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,680
And now there's a big mess.

2119
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,680
It sounded to Loat a lot like the Orange County.

2120
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,680
Well, it sounded like that, but you're right.

2121
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,680
That's very good.

2122
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:35,680
This is three weeks before your dad kills himself.

2123
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,680
He also says...

2124
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,680
It could be why my dad asked for the Orange County memo again.

2125
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,680
If this is looming on him.

2126
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,680
Or it could be Monica DePasque.

2127
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,680
Because that's really what this sounds like to me.

2128
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,680
Bill asked Martin what he should do.

2129
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:55,680
And Loat, who was not very good at reading people, could tell that Bill was like really upset.

2130
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:02,680
And Loat had never forgotten a lesson that Bill had taught him back in their early days together.

2131
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,680
There was a lesson that Reverend Jack had actually told Bill.

2132
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,680
Which is that do write by other people, be honest with them, treat them ethically, things will work out in the end.

2133
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,680
And so he told Bill that.

2134
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,680
He said, I remember when I had a problem with this back in the early days of Deutsche.

2135
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,680
This is what you told me and now I'm telling it to you.

2136
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:23,680
And Bill looked at him, kind of stared off into the distance, didn't say anything.

2137
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,680
And there's an awkward silence.

2138
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:30,680
I think my father realizes his own...

2139
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,680
It's the word fallibility in that sentence.

2140
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,680
His own premature...

2141
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,680
What's the word?

2142
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,680
Juvenile understanding of morality.

2143
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,680
I mean he recognizes his...

2144
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,680
It's the word.

2145
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,680
It's a perfect word.

2146
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,680
It's escaping my mind.

2147
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,680
Immature understanding of morality.

2148
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,680
It's very do write by others and they will do write by you.

2149
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,680
He's learning more and more is not true.

2150
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,680
It's a lot more grayer than that.

2151
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,680
I think it might be simpler.

2152
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,680
I think his whole life is understanding that less, more and more.

2153
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:18,680
He is the moral center of everything and he has always been.

2154
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:23,680
And more he learns, especially after his father died, who was the...

2155
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:30,680
Mr. Moralistic, the pillars of the family and everything else.

2156
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,680
He realizes that this is a fallacy.

2157
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,680
We're going to get into some of the stuff with his dad dying a little bit.

2158
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,680
Just in my chronology.

2159
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,680
I'm sure to hear Martin Lewis say that to him.

2160
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,680
He sees his own hubris.

2161
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,680
My take of...

2162
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,680
It's really interesting.

2163
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,680
My dad's not this deep.

2164
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,680
I mean he's a very bright guy and he knows that something like this,

2165
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,680
saying this is like putting a band-aid on a fucking...

2166
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:00,680
Or maybe he's just deeply upset about whatever...

2167
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,680
I mean, Loats take away from this.

2168
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,680
A sword wound.

2169
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,680
I think was that...

2170
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,680
Do you get what I'm saying?

2171
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,680
100% of what you're saying.

2172
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,680
I'm not being dismissive when I say that.

2173
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,680
It's really interesting.

2174
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,680
I hadn't thought about that.

2175
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,680
So off they go with the girls to Virgin Gorda.

2176
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,680
But what were you going to say before you think...

2177
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,680
I just think the simpler explanation, which isn't necessarily the right one,

2178
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,680
is that...

2179
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,680
But the one that was in my head is that...

2180
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:36,680
Bill is really worried about a transaction or transaction

2181
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,680
that the bank has done with a client that are now boomeranging back at them.

2182
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,680
And he's worried about his culpability in that.

2183
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,680
That's too simple.

2184
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,680
Because what we know now is that McKaylee Faisola did this transaction.

2185
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,680
Well, we don't know what's Monodiposki, by the way.

2186
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,680
That's an assumption.

2187
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,680
Well, I mean, what else could it be?

2188
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,680
Look, we'll get into what Bill knew about Monodiposki.

2189
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,680
Basket trades are over.

2190
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,680
Library's over.

2191
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,680
Well, in fact, hang on.

2192
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,680
What else is going on?

2193
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,680
No, they're not over.

2194
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,680
Well, I mean...

2195
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,680
No, hang on.

2196
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,680
We can do this right now if you want.

2197
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:09,680
In fact, the Monodiposki investigation was scheduled

2198
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:16,680
to begin on Monday, January 27th.

2199
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,680
Really?

2200
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,680
Yes.

2201
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,680
Monday, January 27th.

2202
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,680
Yeah.

2203
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,680
So what is that?

2204
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,680
One day after your death?

2205
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,680
It's the Monday.

2206
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,680
Yeah, it's the day after.

2207
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,680
Libor was not anywhere near done at that point.

2208
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,680
In fact, what had happened with Libor is that a bunch of people had just been arrested

2209
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,680
in the UK because of Libor.

2210
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,680
Right.

2211
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:36,680
And anyway, let's get...

2212
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,680
We'll come back to that.

2213
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,680
So you're...

2214
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,680
Do you think that...

2215
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,680
That means anything?

2216
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,680
I think your dad was...

2217
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,680
No, I mean, the investigation is starting on 27.

2218
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,680
Do you see anything in that?

2219
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:46,680
It's a hell of a coincidence.

2220
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,680
It is, right?

2221
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,680
They got into broken board.

2222
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,680
But what we know is that Faisola handled this trade.

2223
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,680
And my dad, we know for a fact that he went to Anchu...

2224
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,680
Let's come back to that.

2225
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,680
And he said no about this trade.

2226
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,680
He said no.

2227
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,680
And Faisola went around his back.

2228
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,680
He went around my dad's back and ran Anchu's back.

2229
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,680
He did not...

2230
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,680
He did not go through the proper channels.

2231
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,680
Faisola has a very different take on that.

2232
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,680
And...

2233
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,680
No shit.

2234
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,680
He's under 16 fucking indictments from law.

2235
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,680
And he's gonna...

2236
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,680
Yeah, but that stuff is just nonsense.

2237
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,680
It's not nonsense.

2238
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,680
It's not nonsense.

2239
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,680
It's not nonsense.

2240
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,680
Well, because Italian...

2241
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,680
I hear what you're saying.

2242
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,680
Okay.

2243
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,680
There's...

2244
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,680
As long as I'm clear.

2245
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,680
Okay.

2246
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,680
You're clear.

2247
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,680
But look, what we can stipulate here is that your dad killed himself.

2248
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,680
Right?

2249
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,680
We know that.

2250
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,680
And we know that he was worried about stuff at work.

2251
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,680
And so it's not a question of was he worried about stuff at work.

2252
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,680
We know he was.

2253
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,680
But you're saying he's worried about his own culpability.

2254
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,680
And I'm saying...

2255
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,680
I'm not saying that.

2256
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,680
I'm saying...

2257
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,680
Yeah, you just said that he was...

2258
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,680
He expressed his worry about how culpable he was in whatever this trade may be.

2259
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,680
And I'm saying that he's not culpable in anything, as we all know.

2260
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,680
I'm not saying he's culpable.

2261
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:59,680
I mean, looking back, again, hindsight, there's absolutely nothing putting him in any terrible

2262
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,680
trades or any kind of money laundering schemes or basket trades.

2263
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,680
I'm not saying he's culpable.

2264
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,680
I'm saying he's worried he's culpable.

2265
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,680
But he knows he's not culpable, because he knows he has done nothing wrong.

2266
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,680
So that worries the paradox.

2267
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,680
Well, we'll come back to that, because we know the way his psychologist...

2268
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,680
What he told his psychologist and his doctor also.

2269
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,680
Okay.

2270
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,680
But we're going to come back to all of this.

2271
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,680
Okay.

2272
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,680
I promise.

2273
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,680
They go off to Virgin Gorda in the Caribbean.

2274
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,680
They spend a couple of days at a resort.

2275
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,680
And then go with...

2276
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:33,680
During which, when Bill phones into a board meeting about problems with the Fed, then they

2277
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:38,680
join Michael Morandy, his wife and some others, and the Morandy's 47-foot sailboat.

2278
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,680
They swim.

2279
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,680
They snorkel.

2280
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
They drink.

2281
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,680
They smoke.

2282
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,680
They run up cigarettes.

2283
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,680
They search boats.

2284
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,680
They ask for a half-soaked cigarette.

2285
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,680
They drink some more.

2286
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,680
Your mom tries to convince Bill to buy a sailboat.

2287
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,680
Bill kind of goes along with it.

2288
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,680
New Year's Day, motorboat takes them to the airport.

2289
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:59,680
Bill gets sick and pukes.

2290
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,680
And at this time, a couple of your dad's friends who've been spending time with him started

2291
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,680
looking, thinking that it was a little weird that they didn't...

2292
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,680
They felt that they didn't know your dad that well.

2293
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,680
They knew him.

2294
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:22,680
He's a great friend, a loyal friend, like a brilliant, ethical, fascinating, but they

2295
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:23,680
didn't know him.

2296
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,680
They didn't know his emotions.

2297
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,680
And some of this, I think, is probably just men being men, right?

2298
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,680
Right.

2299
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:34,680
This is something that more than one friend, very close friend, who I talked to said.

2300
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:39,680
And they used words like, they didn't really know him.

2301
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,680
Not an emotional level.

2302
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,680
Yeah, but you know what?

2303
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,680
Whatever.

2304
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,680
It's just a bunch of bullshit.

2305
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,680
Because everyone thinks they know someone.

2306
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:49,680
And then when someone does something unexpected, like a suicide, you look back and think,

2307
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,680
I never really knew the guy, because I didn't see that coming.

2308
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,680
No, it's not that.

2309
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,680
If somebody saw it coming, they could say, oh, I knew him well.

2310
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,680
I saw it coming.

2311
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,680
Fair enough.

2312
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,680
Right?

2313
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,680
No, I don't think it's quite that simple.

2314
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,680
But fair enough.

2315
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,680
I think it's quite, I think it is that simple.

2316
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,680
They get back to London.

2317
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,680
And they distance themselves from this person.

2318
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,680
Oh, I didn't know this person, because I did not see this person.

2319
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,680
They're not saying that in that context.

2320
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,680
They're not saying, oh, I didn't see this person.

2321
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,680
Of course, it's all in that context.

2322
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,680
You're right.

2323
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,680
I mean, I'm obviously talking to all these people.

2324
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,680
Yes, in that context.

2325
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,680
In the context of them having killed themselves a few weeks later.

2326
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,680
Right.

2327
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,680
But let's just leave it.

2328
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,680
I hear what you're saying.

2329
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:22,680
Okay.

2330
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,680
Yeah.

2331
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,680
Come back to London.

2332
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,680
He tells Ola that they're going to New York for another DVD sale.

2333
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,680
Board meeting.

2334
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,680
They're going to do the wills.

2335
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:40,680
He tells Ola that he has to meet with the feds when he's there.

2336
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,680
That, I think, has been kind of mis-transposed.

2337
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,680
And he actually meant meet with the fed.

2338
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,680
Capital F.

2339
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,680
Right.

2340
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,680
Because he'd been having phone conversations with the fed.

2341
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,680
Is this the Mark Stein stuff?

2342
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,680
No.

2343
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,680
That's not Mark Stein.

2344
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,680
This is separate.

2345
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,680
And this is, we'll come back to this.

2346
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:01,680
So, I just told you, Monty Deposky has collapsed at this point.

2347
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,680
Faisal, their criminal investigation is in Italy.

2348
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,680
The Germans are about to start a big new investigation on Monday, January 27th.

2349
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,680
Okay.

2350
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,680
Friday, January 24th.

2351
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,680
Anshu is in Davos partying.

2352
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,680
The world is good.

2353
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,680
My favorite line in the book is in this section.

2354
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:26,680
And it describes the party that Deutsche Bank threw hours before your dad killed himself.

2355
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,680
In Davos?

2356
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,680
Yeah.

2357
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,680
And I was there.

2358
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,680
You were there?

2359
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,680
Yeah.

2360
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,680
With Anshu and his wife.

2361
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:38,680
And it's a happy scene.

2362
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,680
Anshu's wife really humanizes him.

2363
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:46,680
Ackerman is there and making peace after this huge violent falling out.

2364
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,680
Bald men's heads.

2365
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,680
Bald men's heads shine with sweat.

2366
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,680
Which I just obsessed with that line.

2367
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,680
Party goes into the early hours of the following morning.

2368
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,680
Is that your line?

2369
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,680
Yeah, that's mine.

2370
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,680
That's pretty good.

2371
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,680
I thought that was Anshu's.

2372
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,680
I figured it was quitting Anshu.

2373
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,680
Okay.

2374
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:06,680
A few hundred miles to the northwest.

2375
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,680
Dance with sweat.

2376
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,680
Bill and Alde go out to dinner.

2377
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,680
I could improve on it just a little bit.

2378
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,680
Bald heads men dance with sweat.

2379
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,680
Bill and Alde go out to dinner.

2380
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:17,680
It's a no.

2381
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:21,680
And then for the final time he falls asleep.

2382
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,680
And sorry, is that it again?

2383
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,680
For the final time he falls asleep.

2384
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,680
Okay.

2385
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,680
Wait, what was the line before that?

2386
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,680
I'm not reading it.

2387
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,680
You didn't hear it.

2388
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,680
There was no line before it as far as I thought.

2389
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,680
Okay, can we take a break for a sec?

2390
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:35,680
Yeah.

2391
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,680
Okay.

2392
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,680
This is in part one.

2393
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,680
Yeah.

2394
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,680
That was more an emotionally exhausting than I thought.

2395
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,680
Okay.
