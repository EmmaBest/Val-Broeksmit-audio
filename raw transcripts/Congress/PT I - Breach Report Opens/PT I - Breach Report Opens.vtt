WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.040
it's recording now sorry okay can you just okay yeah I was looking through the

00:08.040 --> 00:11.480
text just to find out I know but we've got to figure out a good way to record

00:11.480 --> 00:15.480
oh no I never started it was a problem see that now it's he's got the

00:15.480 --> 00:18.960
recording line okay cool so now we know it's cool alright so just to reiterate

00:18.960 --> 00:28.320
we're looking through the DBTC MCO breach report in relation to Don Ska Bank and

00:28.320 --> 00:32.760
we're trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at yeah and my

00:32.760 --> 00:39.280
understanding from the source that I talked to isn't it this is all this is

00:39.280 --> 00:44.520
showing that on a given date which is in this case October 18th 2013 this is the

00:44.520 --> 00:52.120
exposure that Deutsche Bank's USC and a DBTC has DBTC yeah it's a DBTC is the

00:52.120 --> 00:57.960
parent company of DBTC there's like this place is organized like it's like

00:58.320 --> 01:01.680
thousands of legal entities stacked on top of each other so your dad's still

01:01.680 --> 01:07.120
New York base this is still DBTC is also DBTC in base in New York shoot I just

01:07.120 --> 01:13.040
press but yes and and this is what your dad was on the board of both of them

01:13.040 --> 01:19.960
which is why he was getting emails like this with this huge I thought DBTC a was

01:19.960 --> 01:26.520
just specifically DBTC I okay I know you're saying there is a narrow right

01:26.560 --> 01:34.840
DBTC your dad was on the board of both okay and look as I said the thing that

01:34.840 --> 01:40.640
my guy said it was really interesting about this is not really particular

01:40.640 --> 01:46.800
transactions but it's that there are if you go back to the main page of that

01:46.800 --> 01:51.280
spreadsheet you'll see there no the one with the the one we're just looking

01:51.280 --> 01:54.280
at the trades

01:54.840 --> 02:03.080
it's pivot maybe okay yeah if you go it's gonna be really hard to do this on a

02:03.080 --> 02:07.000
tablet but if you were to go do a search for the word Russia for instance or

02:07.000 --> 02:11.360
Moscow you'll see that they're doing business with and I'll show you I've got

02:11.360 --> 02:15.400
this on my computer as well let's just pull it up on your computer well no I

02:15.400 --> 02:19.240
don't know this spreadsheet I just have I'm sure honestly I have you know it's

02:19.240 --> 02:24.200
branching just search MCO breach report as the title of the sheet

02:26.760 --> 02:36.480
this is I don't have it downloaded the but what I do have is I have in the text

02:36.480 --> 02:48.080
of the book I've written down the names of some of the like weird institutions

02:48.600 --> 02:58.320
that show up in the spreadsheet and weird institutions searching for Moscow and

02:58.320 --> 03:09.880
if you tell me with John Moscow my guy is a trip I really think so so here are

03:09.880 --> 03:13.720
some of the entities like there's first of all VTV which is the big and that's a

03:13.720 --> 03:19.840
state-owned bank right that yeah and it's run by one of Putin's closest pals

03:19.840 --> 03:23.800
I know and it's very close size of Deutsche Bank so there's tens of

03:23.800 --> 03:29.960
millions of dollars it shows in outstanding transactions with VTV on

03:29.960 --> 03:34.760
this particular given day there's also but there's all these other obscure

03:34.760 --> 03:37.960
Russian banks that I personally never heard so there's Russian International

03:37.960 --> 03:42.040
Bank okay I know what that is there's Russian joint-stop commercial roads bank

03:43.000 --> 03:48.880
there's Russian mortgage bank okay there's Russian commercial bank Cyprus

03:48.880 --> 03:52.440
limited that makes sense I mean well they're just they're doing business with

03:52.440 --> 03:56.560
a ton of Russian banks and it's really cool all the season people created I don't

03:56.560 --> 04:01.760
think for them between their their may be in the transaction maybe not

04:01.760 --> 04:07.560
necessarily that a lot of them so look if you look in this they're also doing a

04:07.560 --> 04:11.680
ton of business with that you said Don's good banks are doing business with like

04:11.720 --> 04:16.320
Conoco Phillips is in here there's so it's a rain some of these are very

04:16.320 --> 04:21.760
mainstream Arab petrol yeah they're doing a ton of business on this particular

04:21.760 --> 04:27.520
day with a ton of different companies right okay so I don't think this is

04:27.520 --> 04:31.600
gonna answer the fundamental question about clearly they're doing business the

04:31.600 --> 04:33.840
Don's command but this is Deutsche Bank it's one of the biggest banks in the

04:33.840 --> 04:39.920
world is doing business on any given day with like thank you David I know but

04:39.920 --> 04:43.680
look Don's good bank if there's a breach report so we're talking about breaches

04:43.680 --> 04:49.520
in the breaches between Don's good bank and Deutsche Bank so it's not anything

04:49.520 --> 04:55.400
that has to do with see I don't think it reaches I think the breach is that they

04:55.400 --> 05:00.680
have Deutsche has limits that it's normally supposed to be staying with

05:00.680 --> 05:06.080
him so right a breach is when they go over below yeah those thresholds and

05:06.240 --> 05:12.240
breaches I understand but I'm saying this if we can see how much money Don's

05:12.240 --> 05:15.240
good banks owed to Deutsche or Deutsche's owed to Don's good bank and we can

05:15.240 --> 05:20.280
sort of cross-reference with 150 billion that's being reported today you

05:20.280 --> 05:25.160
might have a timeline that we can create from that yeah I understand what you're

05:25.160 --> 05:29.920
saying I don't have the capacity to do that I've spent so many hours looking at

05:29.920 --> 05:39.480
this yeah and it okay well show it to your expert friend with I will yeah I

05:39.480 --> 05:41.760
will do that I mean maybe that's something to say it could be just shot in

05:41.760 --> 05:46.720
the dark it might be worthless but it's worth just you know having once a look

05:46.720 --> 05:53.240
over a quick look over I mean am I right or am I wrong I don't know yeah there

05:53.240 --> 05:57.040
could be something there I mean I've had a I've spent a lot of time with this guy

05:57.520 --> 06:02.360
there's and I think his view is that this is interesting because it shows the

06:02.360 --> 06:08.360
variety of places that Deutsche was doing a ton of business with and it was

06:08.360 --> 06:12.920
more than he thought especially as it related to Russia but was he at all

06:12.920 --> 06:17.640
looking at it through the lens of Don's good bank and what was what's been

06:17.640 --> 06:21.520
happening recently is this before all this is before dawn so now we have

06:21.520 --> 06:25.280
something that might be helpful for that and again David I would like to say for

06:25.320 --> 06:28.920
a year I've been telling you about this Don's good bank stuff here and you've

06:28.920 --> 06:32.160
been saying it's it's silly it's silly but every time there's a new article

06:32.160 --> 06:37.440
about it and now there's we have some a spreadsheet that shows that I was not so

06:37.440 --> 06:43.800
silly you're not there's nothing silly about no I mean about my my referencing

06:43.800 --> 06:47.400
this the spreadsheet in relation to Don's good banks relationship to Deutsche

06:47.400 --> 06:52.760
bank I think there's something here I hear you okay and the guys that Glenn

06:52.800 --> 06:58.480
hired said that this is interesting from a top completely different reason you're

06:58.480 --> 07:02.080
telling me that I'm asking you that is that what he said no and we're gonna

07:02.080 --> 07:07.200
shut that because we can't get into that that's we don't say the names or even

07:07.200 --> 07:20.880
reference okay so yeah okay should we should we start doing a little yeah

07:20.880 --> 07:25.840
let's just get to yeah how do you want to do this let's start the beginning and

07:25.840 --> 07:30.720
just go through the whole thing I just read it to you yes I'll read it to you

07:30.720 --> 07:35.960
yes and you can restore chocolate in a pillow yeah exactly if you have a roaring

07:35.960 --> 07:44.840
fire yes it'd be lovely um that train that yeah raise that train raise that

07:44.840 --> 07:58.160
here yeah I think it's a champion way over you know I've an idea let me I'm

07:58.160 --> 08:13.240
just gonna pause you guys don't have 80% for me

08:28.720 --> 08:32.320
except we'll eat up

08:45.440 --> 08:48.260
you

08:48.260 --> 08:57.780
All right, well, maybe we can just delete all that and just start again.

08:57.780 --> 08:58.780
No, no, no.

08:58.780 --> 08:59.780
It was like a test.

08:59.780 --> 09:00.780
It's fine.

09:00.780 --> 09:01.780
No, there's...

09:01.780 --> 09:04.260
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to bring up that guy.

09:04.260 --> 09:08.140
Yeah, just don't bring up any specifics about sources, because not because it's like...

09:08.140 --> 09:09.140
But did you see what I was doing?

09:09.140 --> 09:12.180
I was like making it look like that was a separate entity from the one that you could

09:12.180 --> 09:13.180
join.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.180
It's fine.

09:14.180 --> 09:15.180
It's...

09:15.180 --> 09:16.980
I was muddying the water, specifically, because I knew that's the guy you're referring

09:16.980 --> 09:17.980
to.

09:17.980 --> 09:18.980
So I made it look like this is a separate person.

09:18.980 --> 09:19.980
Got it.

09:19.980 --> 09:20.980
Okay.

09:20.980 --> 09:21.980
Back up.

09:21.980 --> 09:22.980
Yes.

09:22.980 --> 09:23.980
It's obfuscating.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.980
This source.

09:24.980 --> 09:25.980
Let's not obfuscate anything.

09:25.980 --> 09:26.980
Yes, it is.

09:26.980 --> 09:27.980
That's obfuscating.

09:27.980 --> 09:28.980
No, no, I'm not saying you're not obfuscating.

09:28.980 --> 09:29.980
I'm saying let's not obfuscate.

09:29.980 --> 09:30.980
Oh, okay.

09:30.980 --> 09:31.980
Okay, so...

09:31.980 --> 09:32.980
Okay.

09:32.980 --> 09:33.980
So there are a couple of ways we can do this.

09:33.980 --> 09:34.980
Yes.

09:34.980 --> 09:35.980
One is...

09:35.980 --> 09:45.980
In the way I've got this organized right now on my computer is...

09:46.980 --> 09:52.980
Just a bunch of things in kind of roughly chronological order.

09:52.980 --> 09:53.980
And I've actually kept out.

09:53.980 --> 09:55.980
I've made kind of a document here for myself.

09:55.980 --> 09:56.980
Can I see that?

09:56.980 --> 09:58.980
Can you send me an outline to go through?

09:58.980 --> 09:59.980
No.

09:59.980 --> 10:00.980
Oh, come on.

10:00.980 --> 10:01.980
No, we're not going to do that.

10:01.980 --> 10:02.980
Because it's just like clips from them.

10:02.980 --> 10:06.980
It's like paragraphs that I've cut and pasted into a separate document for the book.

10:06.980 --> 10:07.980
Yeah, that's fine.

10:07.980 --> 10:08.980
I can get that.

10:08.980 --> 10:09.980
Yeah, not sure you'd love that.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.980
But we're not going to do that right now.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.980
Okay.

10:13.980 --> 10:20.980
So basically the way I've got this organized is in chronological order of like your dad's

10:20.980 --> 10:21.980
life onward.

10:21.980 --> 10:25.980
So like your dad is born on November 5th, 1955.

10:25.980 --> 10:26.980
Okay.

10:26.980 --> 10:27.980
And we...

10:27.980 --> 10:29.980
By the way, do we know if he was...

10:29.980 --> 10:30.980
He was...

10:30.980 --> 10:32.980
There are six kids, right?

10:32.980 --> 10:36.980
And was he number three or number four?

10:36.980 --> 10:42.980
So there was Laura and then Peter.

10:42.980 --> 10:45.980
Or sorry, Laura, John, Peter, my dad.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.980
Okay, so he was fourth.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.980
Yeah.

10:47.980 --> 10:48.980
Okay.

10:48.980 --> 10:49.980
And then Sam and then Bob.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.980
And then Sam and Bob.

10:51.980 --> 10:52.980
Okay.

10:55.980 --> 11:00.980
So what I'm not going to do unless you really want to is go through like absolutely everything

11:00.980 --> 11:01.980
because there's a lot...

11:01.980 --> 11:03.980
I would like to go through absolutely everything, yes.

11:03.980 --> 11:04.980
You really want...

11:04.980 --> 11:05.980
Yes.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.980
The reason I say no is because a lot of this is stuff you've told me.

11:07.980 --> 11:08.980
So it's like...

11:08.980 --> 11:09.980
Yeah.

11:09.980 --> 11:10.980
I would like to see how you have...

11:10.980 --> 11:12.980
You're not going to really see how...

11:12.980 --> 11:13.980
Reinterpreted what I told you.

11:13.980 --> 11:14.980
It's not really...

11:14.980 --> 11:15.980
Or reductively...

11:15.980 --> 11:16.980
Okay.

11:16.980 --> 11:17.980
Well, that's fine.

11:17.980 --> 11:18.980
We can go through this in some detail.

11:18.980 --> 11:19.980
So...

11:19.980 --> 11:20.980
Okay.

11:20.980 --> 11:21.980
Okay.

11:21.980 --> 11:29.980
Well, actually, first of all, let's go through the moment, the day on January 26th, 2014,

11:29.980 --> 11:30.980
which...

11:30.980 --> 11:31.980
Is that today?

11:31.980 --> 11:32.980
No.

11:32.980 --> 11:34.980
That's almost exactly five years ago.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.980
Today is January 25th.

11:37.980 --> 11:38.980
Okay.

11:38.980 --> 11:49.980
So you get out of the tube station, drizzling, you're in Sloan Square.

11:49.980 --> 11:54.980
You had the previous night been jamming with your band.

11:54.980 --> 11:59.980
And you have told me in the past that you just woke up that morning not feeling probably

11:59.980 --> 12:00.980
the greatest.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.980
It was more than jamming.

12:02.980 --> 12:03.980
Yeah.

12:03.980 --> 12:05.980
It was a show, I think, and then there was a party.

12:05.980 --> 12:08.980
And I didn't fall asleep until maybe five or six a.m.

12:08.980 --> 12:09.980
I remember.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.980
I was with Beth.

12:11.980 --> 12:12.980
Yeah.

12:12.980 --> 12:13.980
Okay.

12:13.980 --> 12:14.980
Let me grab some water.

12:14.980 --> 12:15.980
Yeah.

12:15.980 --> 12:16.980
Go on.

12:16.980 --> 12:17.980
Sorry.

12:17.980 --> 12:18.980
I'm listening.

12:18.980 --> 12:19.980
Well, I just want to...

12:19.980 --> 12:20.980
That's fine.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.980
So you...

12:23.980 --> 12:27.980
You felt like some sort of negative energy when you were on the tube.

12:27.980 --> 12:28.980
Yeah.

12:28.980 --> 12:29.980
It was very...

12:29.980 --> 12:31.980
Can you just come back here?

12:31.980 --> 12:32.980
Yeah.

12:32.980 --> 12:33.980
Sorry.

12:33.980 --> 12:34.980
I just...

12:34.980 --> 12:35.980
No, I know.

12:35.980 --> 12:36.980
That's...

12:36.980 --> 12:37.980
Well, no.

12:37.980 --> 12:38.980
I don't even need you to.

12:38.980 --> 12:39.980
This is kind of what I'm saying.

12:39.980 --> 12:40.980
Like, there's...

12:40.980 --> 12:53.980
I don't really feel a need to fact check this kind of stuff with you right now because

12:53.980 --> 12:54.980
it's...

12:54.980 --> 12:58.980
This is coming straight from your mouth on 15 different occasions.

12:58.980 --> 12:59.980
So...

13:00.980 --> 13:01.980
Okay.

13:02.980 --> 13:03.980
Okay.

13:03.980 --> 13:04.980
So maybe we should...

13:04.980 --> 13:06.980
You're wearing a hat, no.

13:06.980 --> 13:07.980
Okay.

13:09.980 --> 13:11.980
You don't like the idea of tube bald, man?

13:11.980 --> 13:12.980
No, okay.

13:12.980 --> 13:13.980
Let's be tube bald, guys.

13:13.980 --> 13:14.980
Okay.

13:14.980 --> 13:15.980
All right.

13:15.980 --> 13:16.980
So, yeah.

13:16.980 --> 13:24.980
So I was on the tube and I remember feeling this like overwhelming dark, terrible, foreboding

13:24.980 --> 13:26.980
thing.

13:26.980 --> 13:27.980
It wasn't foreboding, actually.

13:27.980 --> 13:28.980
It was more...

13:28.980 --> 13:31.980
Because foreboding would be for the future, but this was like in the moment.

13:31.980 --> 13:39.980
And I thought maybe it was just like an echo of my lack of sleep and misery waking up early

13:39.980 --> 13:41.980
for me to get down there.

13:41.980 --> 13:47.980
But no, it was like a really dark sort of terribleness.

13:47.980 --> 13:49.980
It's very hard to describe.

13:49.980 --> 13:50.980
And you think that...

13:50.980 --> 13:53.980
It's like a visual sort of thing as well.

13:53.980 --> 13:54.980
It's very strange.

13:54.980 --> 13:58.980
And I thought I was picking up from someone on the tube, you know, because sometimes,

13:58.980 --> 14:03.980
you know, you're on the tube and you pick up other people's like sort of pathology or

14:03.980 --> 14:04.980
emotions or whatever.

14:04.980 --> 14:06.980
And you're like, wait, that's not...

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
Why am I feeling so...

14:07.980 --> 14:09.980
And then you see the guy next to you like, oh.

14:09.980 --> 14:10.980
You know.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.980
And I was like, was there somebody...

14:12.980 --> 14:16.980
But there wasn't anybody around me that was giving off this sort of terrible...

14:16.980 --> 14:19.980
In hindsight, you think that was the moment your dad died?

14:19.980 --> 14:20.980
Yeah.

14:20.980 --> 14:21.980
In hindsight, yeah.

14:21.980 --> 14:26.980
I wrote it down in my notes and I keep meaning to find it, but I still haven't done that

14:26.980 --> 14:27.980
because I don't really want to look at it.

14:27.980 --> 14:30.980
But I will do that if you can remind me.

14:30.980 --> 14:31.980
Okay.

14:31.980 --> 14:32.980
So...

14:32.980 --> 14:36.980
Because at the time, every time I would have an idea or something, because I was still

14:36.980 --> 14:38.980
writing music at that time.

14:38.980 --> 14:43.980
And I would write down thoughts or ideas I had and that one was overwhelmingly strong.

14:43.980 --> 14:48.980
So I wrote it down, like everything about it.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.980
I didn't think much about that until months later.

14:51.980 --> 14:52.980
Yeah.

14:52.980 --> 14:53.980
All right.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.980
So you get out of the tube.

14:54.980 --> 14:55.980
It's drizzly.

14:55.980 --> 14:56.980
You are...

14:56.980 --> 14:59.980
You walk over to the Satya Gallery.

14:59.980 --> 15:00.980
It's one o'clock.

15:00.980 --> 15:01.980
Parents aren't there.

15:01.980 --> 15:02.980
You text them.

15:02.980 --> 15:06.980
You text your mom and say, where are you?

15:06.980 --> 15:07.980
Where are you guys?

15:07.980 --> 15:08.980
No response.

15:08.980 --> 15:09.980
Correct.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.980
And you go then browse around the Tashin bookstore.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.980
Yeah.

15:13.980 --> 15:14.980
Look at that Beatles book.

15:14.980 --> 15:15.980
That's right.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.980
And then who...

15:17.980 --> 15:20.980
And then your phone rings.

15:20.980 --> 15:23.980
And then the phone rings.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.980
Well, there was a few more texts.

15:25.980 --> 15:26.980
Where are you?

15:26.980 --> 15:27.980
What's going on?

15:27.980 --> 15:28.980
I'm here.

15:28.980 --> 15:29.980
And they're usually never late.

15:29.980 --> 15:30.980
I'm always the one that's late.

15:30.980 --> 15:31.980
So...

15:31.980 --> 15:33.980
And I was early this time, which is unusual.

15:33.980 --> 15:34.980
That is...

15:34.980 --> 15:36.980
I can vouch from personal experience.

15:36.980 --> 15:37.980
That's unusual.

15:37.980 --> 15:38.980
Yeah.

15:38.980 --> 15:44.980
And I was looking through the book and I was trying to figure out a way for them to talk

15:44.980 --> 15:48.980
my dad or mom into buying me this for my birthday.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.980
And yeah, send multiple texts.

15:50.980 --> 15:56.980
And then the phone call came in and I believe it said unknown or no caller ID.

15:56.980 --> 15:57.980
I'm not sure.

15:57.980 --> 16:02.980
Which was also strange because if it was my mom or my dad, it would come up as mom or

16:02.980 --> 16:03.980
dad.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.980
And it was a voice.

16:04.980 --> 16:08.980
It was very hard to recognize and a very strong Russian accent.

16:08.980 --> 16:13.980
And I think it was the housekeeper or one of the housekeeper's friends or somebody.

16:14.980 --> 16:15.980
I don't.

16:15.980 --> 16:16.980
It was very fuzzy stuff.

16:16.980 --> 16:17.980
What did the voice say?

16:17.980 --> 16:18.980
Emergency, emergency.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.980
Your father or your father.

16:21.980 --> 16:25.980
Well, your story is aligning perfectly with what I've got written here.

16:25.980 --> 16:26.980
So that's good.

16:28.980 --> 16:29.980
Of course.

16:29.980 --> 16:30.980
You go into...

16:30.980 --> 16:31.980
You grab a...

16:31.980 --> 16:32.980
You hail cab.

16:33.980 --> 16:34.980
Yeah.

16:34.980 --> 16:35.980
I get a black cab.

16:35.980 --> 16:38.980
It was raining a bit, I remember.

16:39.980 --> 16:45.980
And you get to 21 Evelyn Gardens and hop out of the cab.

16:45.980 --> 16:47.980
Was there an ambulance there?

16:47.980 --> 16:49.980
There was, yeah.

16:49.980 --> 16:52.980
And so then what do you do?

16:53.980 --> 16:58.980
That's when I knew that it was, you know, somewhat for real that there was something going on.

16:58.980 --> 17:02.980
Just a verifiable ambulance.

17:02.980 --> 17:07.980
You don't see an ambulance combined with emergency, emergency, you know.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.980
I just ran out of the cab.

17:09.980 --> 17:15.980
I paid the guy, remember, and ran out of the cab, ran up the stairs.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.980
And I already told you all this.

17:17.980 --> 17:19.980
I know, but it's good to just like...

17:19.980 --> 17:21.980
It's actually helpful for me.

17:21.980 --> 17:23.980
Like, do you not want to?

17:23.980 --> 17:24.980
We don't have to.

17:24.980 --> 17:25.980
I mean, this is the same thing.

17:25.980 --> 17:30.980
So, yeah, I get in there, I open the door, and my dad was dead and he's on the floor,

17:30.980 --> 17:32.980
lying on his back in the hallway.

17:32.980 --> 17:37.980
The EMTs were there, and they were finishing up.

17:37.980 --> 17:41.980
They were wrapping up their instruments, and my mom was wailing.

17:41.980 --> 17:43.980
The current crying tears.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.980
Very terrible scene.

17:45.980 --> 17:46.980
Terrible.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.980
Did you know he was dead?

17:48.980 --> 17:55.980
I kind of just instinctively knew, you know, I mean, just when you see the scenes.

17:55.980 --> 17:58.980
Yeah, I can imagine.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.980
Okay, let's move on.

18:01.980 --> 18:04.980
I'm sorry to have to, like, start out with it.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.980
Okay.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.980
You're not sorry.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.980
Well, dude, I can tell...

18:10.980 --> 18:12.980
I know you well enough that I, like, know...

18:12.980 --> 18:15.980
I mean, I've heard the story a million times, obviously, but it's...

18:15.980 --> 18:18.980
I don't enjoy running through the camera.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.980
I know you're kidding.

18:20.980 --> 18:22.980
It honestly is.

18:22.980 --> 18:23.980
Don't worry, I'm just...

18:23.980 --> 18:24.980
I'm not worried.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.980
...giving you shit.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.980
Okay, so...

18:28.980 --> 18:30.980
So what are the details? Do we need...

18:30.980 --> 18:32.980
I don't think we need to go into any more details right there.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.980
I then kind of fast-forward a little bit.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.980
What were the police and the notes? I mean, you have all that, right?

18:37.980 --> 18:39.980
Yeah, I've got that, but I'm not going to get into that.

18:39.980 --> 18:43.980
Why don't you tell me what you have, and then I will tell you if something is correct or incorrect,

18:43.980 --> 18:48.980
rather than me saying the same thing I've been telling you for four years?

18:48.980 --> 18:52.980
Okay, because it's really the way you have processed the information that's important,

18:52.980 --> 18:54.980
not the information I give you again.

18:54.980 --> 18:55.980
Yep, fair enough.

18:55.980 --> 19:02.980
Okay, so let's rewind 55 or 60 years.

19:02.980 --> 19:03.980
Okay.

19:03.980 --> 19:07.980
And so it...

19:07.980 --> 19:11.980
Bill's grandfather, your great-grandfather,

19:11.980 --> 19:13.980
there's a guy named John Shaw Brooksman.

19:13.980 --> 19:14.980
Yeah.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.980
And he started off being a sheep rancher.

19:16.980 --> 19:17.980
Okay.

19:17.980 --> 19:18.980
Do you know that?

19:18.980 --> 19:20.980
No, Gar.

19:20.980 --> 19:21.980
Gar?

19:21.980 --> 19:22.980
I think they call him Gar.

19:22.980 --> 19:23.980
I don't know.

19:23.980 --> 19:24.980
I...

19:24.980 --> 19:26.980
He gave sheep ranching a try.

19:26.980 --> 19:27.980
Oh, wait, on whose side?

19:27.980 --> 19:28.980
On my...

19:28.980 --> 19:30.980
This is your dad's...

19:30.980 --> 19:31.980
Mother's side?

19:31.980 --> 19:33.980
Dad's...

19:33.980 --> 19:35.980
grandfather.

19:35.980 --> 19:36.980
So it's paternal.

19:36.980 --> 19:39.980
So his father's father?

19:39.980 --> 19:41.980
His father's father, yes.

19:41.980 --> 19:42.980
Okay, Jack's father.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.980
So this is not Reverend Jack.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.980
This is Reverend Jack's dad.

19:46.980 --> 19:47.980
Yeah, no, this isn't different.

19:47.980 --> 19:51.980
Gar is Jack's wife's father.

19:51.980 --> 19:55.980
So your great-grandfather, Reverend Jack's dad,

19:55.980 --> 19:56.980
becomes...

19:56.980 --> 19:57.980
There's some great...

19:57.980 --> 19:59.980
Like he wrote about his experience,

19:59.980 --> 20:02.980
because he, for something back in 1906,

20:02.980 --> 20:03.980
which I tracked down,

20:03.980 --> 20:05.980
and he, after becoming a sheep rancher,

20:05.980 --> 20:07.980
decided to be a banker,

20:07.980 --> 20:09.980
and worked at a bank in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

20:09.980 --> 20:11.980
and he started at the very bottom.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.980
He was washing windows and scrubbing floors.

20:13.980 --> 20:14.980
For your...

20:14.980 --> 20:16.980
This was...

20:16.980 --> 20:17.980
He described this.

20:17.980 --> 20:21.980
This is probably, I guess, the late 1800s,

20:21.980 --> 20:25.980
because he wrote about this in 1906.

20:25.980 --> 20:26.980
Massachusetts?

20:26.980 --> 20:27.980
No, in Iowa.

20:27.980 --> 20:28.980
In Iowa? Okay.

20:28.980 --> 20:29.980
He said,

20:29.980 --> 20:30.980
all the money that fell on the floor went to me,

20:30.980 --> 20:33.980
and for a while, it was pretty poor picking.

20:33.980 --> 20:35.980
But he spent his career there,

20:35.980 --> 20:37.980
and they were in banking,

20:37.980 --> 20:38.980
and eventually he ended up

20:38.980 --> 20:40.980
at a big Chicago bank, Harris Trust.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.980
And by the Great Depression,

20:43.980 --> 20:46.980
he had enough kind of seniority

20:46.980 --> 20:49.980
that he was summoned to testify in Washington

20:49.980 --> 20:51.980
before the big Senate committee,

20:51.980 --> 20:52.980
the PCORA Commission,

20:52.980 --> 20:55.980
that was investigating.

20:55.980 --> 20:56.980
It was like, basically,

20:56.980 --> 20:58.980
the financial crisis inquiry commission

20:58.980 --> 21:00.980
80 years earlier.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.980
What was this crisis over?

21:02.980 --> 21:03.980
The Great Depression.

21:03.980 --> 21:04.980
Oh, the Great Depression.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.980
Yeah, so it was like the 1929 stock market crash,

21:06.980 --> 21:08.980
and then they ensue in the Depression.

21:08.980 --> 21:14.980
So, John, the banker as a son,

21:14.980 --> 21:17.980
Jack, John Jr.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.980
And the daughter.

21:19.980 --> 21:20.980
Yeah.

21:20.980 --> 21:25.980
Well, but for this kind of branch of the family tree,

21:25.980 --> 21:27.980
the son is relevant.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.980
So this is Reverend Jack.

21:29.980 --> 21:30.980
He's not Reverend Jack at first.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.980
At first, he's a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II,

21:33.980 --> 21:35.980
sinks a U-boat.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.980
Jack, Marys Jane,

21:38.980 --> 21:41.980
who's a librarian and an amateur artist,

21:41.980 --> 21:43.980
they then have six children.

21:43.980 --> 21:46.980
And in the middle, number four is your dad.

21:46.980 --> 21:48.980
And Jane's background is interesting, too.

21:48.980 --> 21:50.980
I know, it is interesting.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.980
She's got, and she was Yale as well.

21:52.980 --> 21:53.980
Vassar.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.980
Or Vassar, yeah, Vassar.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.980
She's an intellectual family.

21:56.980 --> 21:57.980
Very, yeah.

21:57.980 --> 21:58.980
Yep.

21:58.980 --> 21:59.980
Yeah.

21:59.980 --> 22:00.980
Gar was her father.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.980
Okay.

22:02.980 --> 22:05.980
He's one of the school of Prescott Bush.

22:05.980 --> 22:06.980
Interesting.

22:06.980 --> 22:08.980
Yeah.

22:08.980 --> 22:09.980
At Yale.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.980
So Jack goes into the ministry

22:11.980 --> 22:14.980
with the United Church of Christ.

22:14.980 --> 22:16.980
Initially, he's in Galva, Illinois.

22:16.980 --> 22:17.980
Yeah, that's right.

22:17.980 --> 22:20.980
And it was,

22:20.980 --> 22:23.980
Jane gave art lectures there.

22:23.980 --> 22:26.980
Laura, so Bill's older sister

22:26.980 --> 22:28.980
did some music performances there.

22:28.980 --> 22:29.980
And there were, you know,

22:29.980 --> 22:30.980
old newspaper records of this.

22:30.980 --> 22:31.980
Right.

22:31.980 --> 22:37.980
And Reverend Jack was known in the community as,

22:37.980 --> 22:40.980
just like, not only like a pillar of the community,

22:40.980 --> 22:42.980
but also someone who would,

22:42.980 --> 22:44.980
he taught about the importance of understanding things

22:44.980 --> 22:46.980
from other people's perspectives.

22:46.980 --> 22:47.980
Right.

22:47.980 --> 22:50.980
And this is something that,

22:50.980 --> 22:53.980
your dad would later tell people that it's,

22:53.980 --> 22:56.980
this is kind of one of the guiding principles in his life

22:56.980 --> 22:58.980
that he learned was from Reverend Jack.

22:58.980 --> 23:02.980
And so they lived in Galva on this quiet,

23:02.980 --> 23:04.980
tree-lined street,

23:04.980 --> 23:09.980
old two-story house that had been built in the Great Depression.

23:09.980 --> 23:14.980
Bob later would say that there was a certain amount

23:14.980 --> 23:17.980
of education pedigree, but there wasn't any money.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.980
And they would, you know,

23:19.980 --> 23:21.980
cycle through all these different communities

23:21.980 --> 23:23.980
and to different churches.

23:23.980 --> 23:24.980
Bob told you this.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.980
No.

23:26.980 --> 23:28.980
I've heard this from a couple of other people, though.

23:28.980 --> 23:31.980
And Jane would decorate the houses

23:31.980 --> 23:33.980
with watercolors that she would paint.

23:33.980 --> 23:34.980
Sure.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.980
She's good.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.980
She's good.

23:37.980 --> 23:42.980
So, Bill starts to grow up

23:42.980 --> 23:44.980
and he has a newspaper route.

23:44.980 --> 23:47.980
Gets his two younger brothers to stuff the papers.

23:47.980 --> 23:49.980
Right, the newspaper route.

23:49.980 --> 23:50.980
That's right, I forgot about that.

23:50.980 --> 23:52.980
With like little pamphlets and do,

23:52.980 --> 23:56.980
deliver them and Bill takes the money and saves it

23:56.980 --> 23:58.980
and uses the money to buy a TV

23:58.980 --> 24:01.980
that Reverend Jack had been unwilling to buy.

24:01.980 --> 24:02.980
He goes to League Forest,

24:02.980 --> 24:05.980
which is a, you know, elite prep school in the Chicago area.

24:06.980 --> 24:09.980
He goes to Clark Men's College,

24:09.980 --> 24:12.980
which is where I, 25 years later, would go.

24:12.980 --> 24:13.980
And my sister would go, too.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.980
And your sister would go.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.980
And this is where your dance life gets a little bit,

24:20.980 --> 24:22.980
not what I'd expected.

24:22.980 --> 24:27.980
So he is, he is a big party-er.

24:27.980 --> 24:28.980
Really?

24:28.980 --> 24:29.980
A very big party.

24:29.980 --> 24:30.980
Is he?

24:31.980 --> 24:36.980
He was known as a binge drinker, pot smoker.

24:37.980 --> 24:41.980
He, his friends would tease him about his preference

24:41.980 --> 24:44.980
for what at the time were exotic women.

24:45.980 --> 24:48.980
And also his preference for like, you know,

24:48.980 --> 24:51.980
what was, well, they called him Billy Disco

24:51.980 --> 24:53.980
because he really was cool in the gang.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.980
I didn't know that one.

24:56.980 --> 24:57.980
Billy Disco?

24:57.980 --> 24:58.980
That's funny.

24:58.980 --> 24:59.980
One of the things I've done is

24:59.980 --> 25:02.980
I talked to a bunch of his college, old college friends.

25:03.980 --> 25:04.980
Billy Disco?

25:04.980 --> 25:05.980
That's fucking funny.

25:05.980 --> 25:07.980
So they would, you know,

25:07.980 --> 25:09.980
and I get into a little bit about

25:09.980 --> 25:11.980
kind of the extracurricular activities they had.

25:11.980 --> 25:14.980
And, well, you know,

25:14.980 --> 25:16.980
there's like a dingy San Diego strip club

25:16.980 --> 25:18.980
that they would go to that bill would later describe.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.980
I think this is in the emails that you've showed me.

25:20.980 --> 25:22.980
How they would slip dollar bills

25:22.980 --> 25:24.980
into the G strings of heroin addicts.

25:24.980 --> 25:30.980
There is a Vegas was a popular destination

25:30.980 --> 25:32.980
as it was in my time when I went to CMC as well.

25:32.980 --> 25:33.980
Yeah.

25:33.980 --> 25:38.980
And so despite all of his like, kind of wild side,

25:38.980 --> 25:39.980
he was also a really good student.

25:39.980 --> 25:42.980
He was really into finance, even at,

25:42.980 --> 25:43.980
the two things he was really into at that time

25:43.980 --> 25:44.980
were politics and finance.

25:44.980 --> 25:46.980
And he understood finance in this kind of like,

25:46.980 --> 25:49.980
oddly sophisticated way for someone who was, you know,

25:49.980 --> 25:50.980
a 20-year-old.

25:50.980 --> 25:52.980
Well, he wanted to be a sports writer as well.

25:52.980 --> 25:53.980
Yeah.

25:53.980 --> 25:54.980
He wanted to be a journalist.

25:54.980 --> 25:57.980
And so, well, listen to this.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.980
So he, he was kind of getting,

26:00.980 --> 26:02.980
getting some of his buddies in college

26:02.980 --> 26:05.980
interested in stock trading and even in like little,

26:05.980 --> 26:07.980
like very simple types of derivatives,

26:07.980 --> 26:08.980
even at that age.

26:08.980 --> 26:11.980
And how would Bill, who grew up without any money

26:11.980 --> 26:13.980
and was on scholarship at CMC,

26:13.980 --> 26:15.980
how would he make his own bets?

26:15.980 --> 26:16.980
How would he finance that?

26:16.980 --> 26:20.980
Well, he developed a fairly lucrative career,

26:21.980 --> 26:24.980
writing term papers, term papers for other students.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.980
He never told me this.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.980
The way his friend, one of his best friends at the time,

26:29.980 --> 26:31.980
John Shink, who's a classmate of his,

26:31.980 --> 26:34.980
describes it as, it was mostly for some of the more

26:34.980 --> 26:37.980
privileged students there.

26:37.980 --> 26:39.980
And he says, quote, there are a lot of people

26:39.980 --> 26:41.980
who wouldn't have made it through Claremont

26:41.980 --> 26:42.980
if it wasn't for Bill's help.

26:42.980 --> 26:43.980
That's funny.

26:43.980 --> 26:48.980
So, really into politics, after graduating,

26:49.980 --> 26:52.980
he did some campaign work for local Republicans

26:52.980 --> 26:54.980
running for Congress while he was there,

26:54.980 --> 26:55.980
while he was in college.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.980
And after graduating, he lived in Pasadena

26:57.980 --> 26:58.980
with a group of his friends.

26:58.980 --> 27:02.980
And he and John Shink set up a consulting firm.

27:02.980 --> 27:07.980
They produced position papers for a bunch of candidates

27:07.980 --> 27:11.980
and basically for a bunch of Republican candidates

27:11.980 --> 27:12.980
all throughout California.

27:12.980 --> 27:17.980
And, but again, his like, his demons came out at night.

27:17.980 --> 27:19.980
So, why do you say demons?

27:19.980 --> 27:24.980
Because he was into, there's a lot of heavy drinking.

27:24.980 --> 27:26.980
There were prostitutes.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.980
But why is this your drinking with demons?

27:28.980 --> 27:29.980
Why is this demonic now?

27:29.980 --> 27:30.980
Why is this a negative connotation?

27:30.980 --> 27:32.980
I don't think it's, it's not demonic.

27:32.980 --> 27:34.980
It's that, it's an expression.

27:34.980 --> 27:36.980
Yeah, I know the expression, this is your negative expression

27:36.980 --> 27:38.980
to say your demons come out at night

27:38.980 --> 27:40.980
because you like to party, you like to drink.

27:40.980 --> 27:42.980
Well, he was known as...

27:42.980 --> 27:43.980
It's a bit unfair.

27:43.980 --> 27:45.980
Okay.

27:45.980 --> 27:48.980
He, he just didn't know how to turn it off.

27:48.980 --> 27:52.980
John Shink says another one.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.980
Tom Marks, who's another Claremont alum,

27:54.980 --> 27:56.980
and this is a guy, they then moved to Chicago

27:56.980 --> 27:58.980
and this was his roommate at the time.

27:58.980 --> 28:00.980
Okay.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.980
Bill was wonderfully brilliant but deeply troubled.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.980
In clinical terms, he was incredibly fucked up.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.980
He did things by day that were not,

28:07.980 --> 28:09.980
that were in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior.

28:09.980 --> 28:10.980
I'm sorry, he did things by night

28:10.980 --> 28:12.980
that were in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.980
And it, uh...

28:14.980 --> 28:16.980
He's a proper person.

28:16.980 --> 28:17.980
Yeah, he is a proper person.

28:17.980 --> 28:18.980
There's, there's...

28:18.980 --> 28:21.980
And look, and listen, so he...

28:21.980 --> 28:23.980
What's, why is that...

28:23.980 --> 28:24.980
What's wrong with that?

28:24.980 --> 28:25.980
And why was it clinically fucked up

28:25.980 --> 28:27.980
because that is the opposite of clinical?

28:27.980 --> 28:30.980
I think that's a turn of phrase by his friend.

28:30.980 --> 28:31.980
Oh, it's a quote.

28:31.980 --> 28:33.980
Again, that's not my words.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.980
Those are, those are his roommate's words at the time.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.980
Whoever this guy is is...

28:37.980 --> 28:38.980
Okay.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.980
No, this is, this is two or three different people, though,

28:40.980 --> 28:41.980
now who are being quoted.

28:41.980 --> 28:44.980
Whoever said clinically fucked up is...

28:44.980 --> 28:46.980
He said in clinical terms, he was incredibly fucked up.

28:46.980 --> 28:47.980
That's, it's a...

28:47.980 --> 28:48.980
Like, obviously...

28:48.980 --> 28:49.980
In clinical terms, he's really fucked up.

28:49.980 --> 28:50.980
No, that's like a joke.

28:50.980 --> 28:51.980
I know, it's a terrible joke.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.980
It's, it's not funny.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.980
The, but here, look, there's another side to this

28:55.980 --> 28:58.980
because this guy's also, Bill stands out,

28:58.980 --> 29:01.980
your father stands out as the mature one in the group.

29:01.980 --> 29:03.980
And when he says it's in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior,

29:03.980 --> 29:05.980
well his daytime behavior was, he was the responsible one.

29:05.980 --> 29:06.980
Okay.

29:06.980 --> 29:10.980
He, uh, he needed a car to get to work.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.980
Until he just went out and bought a used Mustang.

29:12.980 --> 29:13.980
Yeah.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.980
And it was like, he actually functioned in the real world.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.980
And I can say, I know you can say it's like,

29:17.980 --> 29:19.980
when recent graduates of college,

29:19.980 --> 29:21.980
that is like not normal behavior, right?

29:21.980 --> 29:23.980
It's like a whole, you have to get your parents involved

29:23.980 --> 29:24.980
and like figure shit out.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.980
He was figuring stuff out on his own.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.980
When a colleague's wife died, Bill sent a sympathy card,

29:29.980 --> 29:31.980
which would never recurred to his,

29:31.980 --> 29:32.980
the people he's living with.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.980
And his girlfriend says, quote,

29:34.980 --> 29:36.980
I asked him why, and he said,

29:36.980 --> 29:38.980
because it's what's done, it's the right thing to do.

29:38.980 --> 29:39.980
That's right.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.980
And most of us, Bill was self-sufficient and responsible.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.980
I would hear a lot of that for him.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.980
Cause that's what you do.

29:45.980 --> 29:46.980
Yeah.

29:46.980 --> 29:47.980
Cause that's what you do though.

29:47.980 --> 29:48.980
You would say that often.

29:48.980 --> 29:52.980
Well, he had that going when he was 21 years old.

29:52.980 --> 29:53.980
Yeah.

29:53.980 --> 29:54.980
Um,

29:54.980 --> 29:55.980
Wow.

29:55.980 --> 29:58.980
I've got a delightful little anecdote here that,

29:58.980 --> 30:01.980
you know, it doesn't prove anything one way or the other,

30:01.980 --> 30:02.980
but just interesting.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.980
So in early 1980s,

30:04.980 --> 30:08.980
Bill flies from Chicago to Vegas to have a little reunion

30:08.980 --> 30:09.980
with John Shink.

30:09.980 --> 30:11.980
So one of his best friends in college.

30:11.980 --> 30:14.980
And, you know, they're drinking and gambling and it's late at night

30:14.980 --> 30:18.980
and they're walking back down the strip toward their hotel.

30:18.980 --> 30:21.980
And, uh, two prostitutes come up to them.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.980
And, you know, these are two drunk 22 year olds or whatever.

30:24.980 --> 30:28.980
So they're, uh, prostitutes or maybe 24 year olds.

30:28.980 --> 30:31.980
Uh, prostitutes, uh, walk up to them,

30:31.980 --> 30:33.980
start fondling them a little bit.

30:33.980 --> 30:35.980
Guys aren't putting up much of a fight.

30:35.980 --> 30:38.980
And then the prostitutes walk away and Bill and,

30:38.980 --> 30:41.980
uh, John are walking back toward their hotel room.

30:41.980 --> 30:42.980
Right.

30:42.980 --> 30:45.980
And your dad realizes this whole thing had been a ruse.

30:45.980 --> 30:49.980
The one of the prostitutes had stolen hundreds of dollars out of his pocket

30:49.980 --> 30:51.980
while feeling him up.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.980
And so Bill yells and then starts chasing them.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.980
And he tackles one of them.

30:57.980 --> 30:58.980
He tackles her.

30:58.980 --> 31:01.980
And they are rolling around on a dirty sidewalk.

31:01.980 --> 31:03.980
Bill trying to get his money back.

31:03.980 --> 31:07.980
The prostitute gets presumably screaming until the cops came and broke it up.

31:07.980 --> 31:08.980
That's funny.

31:08.980 --> 31:09.980
Yeah.

31:09.980 --> 31:10.980
Oh, that's great.

31:10.980 --> 31:11.980
Did he get the money back?

31:11.980 --> 31:12.980
He got the money back.

31:12.980 --> 31:13.980
The cops gave it back.

31:13.980 --> 31:14.980
Gave him the money back.

31:14.980 --> 31:15.980
Wow.

31:15.980 --> 31:16.980
Um, okay.

31:16.980 --> 31:20.980
So, and again, I'm just doing this based on the way I've got this structured

31:20.980 --> 31:21.980
right now.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.980
So we're taking a little break chronologically.

31:23.980 --> 31:24.980
That's great.

31:24.980 --> 31:25.980
I didn't know that.

31:25.980 --> 31:26.980
That's funny.

31:26.980 --> 31:29.980
And we rewind to January 1976.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.980
Bill's never told that story.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.980
Never heard that.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.980
Um, so we go, you're born.

31:35.980 --> 31:36.980
Okay.

31:36.980 --> 31:37.980
In Kiev.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.980
Uh, to Allah and Alexander.

31:40.980 --> 31:46.980
Um, I described that wonderful black and white photo that you have of them at the party.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.980
Um, are you going to include these photos?

31:49.980 --> 31:50.980
I don't know.

31:50.980 --> 31:51.980
I don't know.

31:51.980 --> 31:52.980
I mean, you can, you can if you want.

31:52.980 --> 31:53.980
Okay, cool.

31:53.980 --> 31:54.980
That's good.

31:54.980 --> 31:55.980
I don't really know how that works.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.980
I think for these purposes, I think it would be good to be able to do that.

31:58.980 --> 32:07.980
Um, so, uh, Allah was, uh, I don't know if you know how much you know about this history

32:07.980 --> 32:10.980
of Russian Jews in the seventies and early eighties.

32:10.980 --> 32:11.980
Yeah.

32:11.980 --> 32:16.980
I mean, so they, she after get graduate from college follows like a felt a fairly well

32:16.980 --> 32:23.980
worn path gets an Israeli exit visa, uh, goes to first Vienna and then Rome, which it's

32:23.980 --> 32:24.980
weird.

32:24.980 --> 32:26.980
Like I never realized this until I started looking into your story.

32:26.980 --> 32:30.980
Like that's a million other people did the exact same thing.

32:30.980 --> 32:34.980
Not just leaving Russia, but going to Vienna and then Rome and then getting waiting in

32:34.980 --> 32:37.980
Rome for getting those exit visas or is not.

32:37.980 --> 32:38.980
Yeah.

32:38.980 --> 32:39.980
It wasn't, you know, it wasn't easy.

32:39.980 --> 32:44.980
But I heard the stories of selling my grandfather's medals and World War II medals and bribing

32:44.980 --> 32:46.980
everyone along the way.

32:46.980 --> 32:47.980
Yep.

32:47.980 --> 32:52.980
And just looking, going back to like old news stories at the time, you can see people

32:52.980 --> 32:58.980
like in very similar situation situations to your family at the time, like fleeing for

32:58.980 --> 33:01.980
the same reason and following the exact same geographical path.

33:01.980 --> 33:06.980
And so, uh, and in fact, a lot of them ending up in Chicago as well, which is obviously.

33:06.980 --> 33:07.980
That's strange.

33:07.980 --> 33:09.980
Why Chicago of all places?

33:09.980 --> 33:19.980
I think it's just the, I mean, there's a local newspaper in 1978 or 1979 actually, which

33:19.980 --> 33:25.980
is the same year your family arrived there, uh, described it as this is a local community

33:25.980 --> 33:28.980
leader or the head of the Jewish community centers in Chicago told the local newspaper

33:28.980 --> 33:30.980
that it's a mass exodus.

33:30.980 --> 33:32.980
They're all coming here.

33:32.980 --> 33:39.980
Um, so this is where things get a little bit ugly as you know.

33:39.980 --> 33:45.980
And, um, so your mom is working in the Stanley Corsac department store.

33:45.980 --> 33:46.980
Your mom gets a job.

33:46.980 --> 33:47.980
She has two jobs.

33:47.980 --> 33:52.980
One is a cocktail waitress and the other is working in this luxury good store on the

33:52.980 --> 33:54.980
magnificent mile in Chicago.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.980
This is this store is called Stanley Corsac.

33:56.980 --> 33:57.980
Right.

33:57.980 --> 33:58.980
She was selling for coats.

33:58.980 --> 34:02.980
And I think her job actually as far as I can tell was creating displays.

34:02.980 --> 34:04.980
So she was, um, right?

34:04.980 --> 34:05.980
Yeah.

34:05.980 --> 34:06.980
She did the windows.

34:06.980 --> 34:07.980
Yeah.

34:07.980 --> 34:08.980
The window displays exactly.

34:08.980 --> 34:09.980
Well, that's okay.

34:09.980 --> 34:12.980
Uh, Marie, you know the jewels are?

34:12.980 --> 34:17.980
I saw some over on some of those little pop mango pods over there where my phone plugged

34:17.980 --> 34:18.980
in.

34:18.980 --> 34:19.980
Yeah.

34:19.980 --> 34:20.980
Yeah.

34:20.980 --> 34:21.980
The actual.

34:21.980 --> 34:23.980
And also we need to.

34:23.980 --> 34:25.980
Here I'm just going to.

34:25.980 --> 34:26.980
Right.

34:26.980 --> 34:27.980
Okay.

34:27.980 --> 34:30.980
You got to keep a secret.

34:30.980 --> 34:31.980
Okay.

34:31.980 --> 34:32.980
It's off.

34:32.980 --> 34:33.980
Okay.

34:33.980 --> 34:35.980
So we'll just be careful.

34:35.980 --> 34:36.980
Wait.

34:36.980 --> 34:37.980
Sorry.

34:37.980 --> 34:38.980
Say that again.

34:38.980 --> 34:43.980
I'm not mentioning Marie.

34:43.980 --> 34:44.980
Yeah.

34:44.980 --> 34:45.980
Yeah.

34:45.980 --> 34:46.980
Totally.

34:46.980 --> 34:47.980
I mean, that's not chronologically.

34:47.980 --> 34:50.980
That's like the very end of the pace we're going.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.980
We'll get there in about two weeks.

34:52.980 --> 34:53.980
Oh, okay.

34:53.980 --> 34:55.980
So we're very careful talking to the camera.

34:55.980 --> 34:57.980
So we don't know who you are.

34:57.980 --> 34:58.980
Oh, I see.

34:58.980 --> 34:59.980
So you.

34:59.980 --> 35:00.980
Oh, shit.

35:00.980 --> 35:02.980
So I, that's actually a good point.

35:02.980 --> 35:04.980
I walked in here and was like, hi, Marie.

35:04.980 --> 35:05.980
Yeah.

35:05.980 --> 35:06.980
It's fine.

35:06.980 --> 35:07.980
I mean, there's no.

35:07.980 --> 35:08.980
Yeah.

35:08.980 --> 35:09.980
Because.

35:09.980 --> 35:10.980
For now.

35:10.980 --> 35:11.980
Well, she might.

35:11.980 --> 35:12.980
I don't know.

35:12.980 --> 35:13.980
It's fine.

35:13.980 --> 35:14.980
Don't worry.

35:14.980 --> 35:15.980
I totally know what you're saying.

35:15.980 --> 35:16.980
And that's not.

35:16.980 --> 35:17.980
Yeah.

35:17.980 --> 35:18.980
We just want to protect her for now until.

35:18.980 --> 35:19.980
We just let my mom.

35:19.980 --> 35:20.980
Um.

35:20.980 --> 35:21.980
All that is not good.

35:21.980 --> 35:22.980
I'm just here.

35:22.980 --> 35:23.980
This thing.

35:23.980 --> 35:24.980
She's not going to see that.

35:24.980 --> 35:25.980
I mean.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.980
This is going to like be what?

35:27.980 --> 35:28.980
Let's do it.

35:28.980 --> 35:29.980
That's actually happened.

35:29.980 --> 35:30.980
It's going to be watched by a lot of people.

35:30.980 --> 35:31.980
But not.

35:31.980 --> 35:32.980
It's going to be in conjunction with.

35:32.980 --> 35:33.980
Yeah.

35:33.980 --> 35:35.980
But it's not like imminent in both control.

35:35.980 --> 35:36.980
Over.

35:36.980 --> 35:37.980
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

35:37.980 --> 35:38.980
We're.

35:38.980 --> 35:39.980
I like the word.

35:39.980 --> 35:40.980
It's not imminent.

35:40.980 --> 35:41.980
Um.

35:41.980 --> 35:42.980
But just be careful.

35:42.980 --> 35:43.980
Would you want me to get.

35:43.980 --> 35:44.980
I couldn't get to the cafe.

35:44.980 --> 35:45.980
No.

35:45.980 --> 35:46.980
No.

35:46.980 --> 35:47.980
I just mean.

35:47.980 --> 35:48.980
Like.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.980
I mentioned.

35:49.980 --> 35:50.980
No.

35:50.980 --> 35:51.980
The other jewels.

35:51.980 --> 35:52.980
And all of a sudden.

35:52.980 --> 35:53.980
Like someone.

35:53.980 --> 35:54.980
Honestly, they do.

35:54.980 --> 35:55.980
I.

35:55.980 --> 35:56.980
Marie.

35:56.980 --> 35:57.980
Like.

35:57.980 --> 35:58.980
But it fell.

35:58.980 --> 35:59.980
By the time this airs.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
Let's say.

36:00.980 --> 36:01.980
Well, but.

36:01.980 --> 36:02.980
But just to be clear.

36:02.980 --> 36:04.980
In again, the camera's off right now.

36:04.980 --> 36:05.980
So.

36:05.980 --> 36:07.980
Although your phone might still be recorded.

36:07.980 --> 36:08.980
It's still.

36:08.980 --> 36:09.980
Just turn it off.

36:09.980 --> 36:10.980
Okay.

36:10.980 --> 36:11.980
Um.
