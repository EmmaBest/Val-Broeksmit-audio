1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
it's recording now sorry okay can you just okay yeah I was looking through the

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,480
text just to find out I know but we've got to figure out a good way to record

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,480
oh no I never started it was a problem see that now it's he's got the

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,960
recording line okay cool so now we know it's cool alright so just to reiterate

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:28,320
we're looking through the DBTC MCO breach report in relation to Don Ska Bank and

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,760
we're trying to figure out exactly what we're looking at yeah and my

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,280
understanding from the source that I talked to isn't it this is all this is

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,520
showing that on a given date which is in this case October 18th 2013 this is the

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,120
exposure that Deutsche Bank's USC and a DBTC has DBTC yeah it's a DBTC is the

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,960
parent company of DBTC there's like this place is organized like it's like

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
thousands of legal entities stacked on top of each other so your dad's still

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,120
New York base this is still DBTC is also DBTC in base in New York shoot I just

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,040
press but yes and and this is what your dad was on the board of both of them

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,960
which is why he was getting emails like this with this huge I thought DBTC a was

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,520
just specifically DBTC I okay I know you're saying there is a narrow right

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,840
DBTC your dad was on the board of both okay and look as I said the thing that

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,640
my guy said it was really interesting about this is not really particular

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,800
transactions but it's that there are if you go back to the main page of that

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,280
spreadsheet you'll see there no the one with the the one we're just looking

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,280
at the trades

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:03,080
it's pivot maybe okay yeah if you go it's gonna be really hard to do this on a

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,000
tablet but if you were to go do a search for the word Russia for instance or

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,360
Moscow you'll see that they're doing business with and I'll show you I've got

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,400
this on my computer as well let's just pull it up on your computer well no I

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,240
don't know this spreadsheet I just have I'm sure honestly I have you know it's

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,200
branching just search MCO breach report as the title of the sheet

27
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:36,480
this is I don't have it downloaded the but what I do have is I have in the text

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:48,080
of the book I've written down the names of some of the like weird institutions

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:58,320
that show up in the spreadsheet and weird institutions searching for Moscow and

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:09,880
if you tell me with John Moscow my guy is a trip I really think so so here are

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,720
some of the entities like there's first of all VTV which is the big and that's a

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,840
state-owned bank right that yeah and it's run by one of Putin's closest pals

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,800
I know and it's very close size of Deutsche Bank so there's tens of

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,960
millions of dollars it shows in outstanding transactions with VTV on

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,760
this particular given day there's also but there's all these other obscure

36
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Russian banks that I personally never heard so there's Russian International

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,040
Bank okay I know what that is there's Russian joint-stop commercial roads bank

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,880
there's Russian mortgage bank okay there's Russian commercial bank Cyprus

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,440
limited that makes sense I mean well they're just they're doing business with

40
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,560
a ton of Russian banks and it's really cool all the season people created I don't

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,760
think for them between their their may be in the transaction maybe not

42
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,560
necessarily that a lot of them so look if you look in this they're also doing a

43
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,680
ton of business with that you said Don's good banks are doing business with like

44
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Conoco Phillips is in here there's so it's a rain some of these are very

45
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,760
mainstream Arab petrol yeah they're doing a ton of business on this particular

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,520
day with a ton of different companies right okay so I don't think this is

47
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,600
gonna answer the fundamental question about clearly they're doing business the

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
Don's command but this is Deutsche Bank it's one of the biggest banks in the

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,920
world is doing business on any given day with like thank you David I know but

50
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,680
look Don's good bank if there's a breach report so we're talking about breaches

51
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,520
in the breaches between Don's good bank and Deutsche Bank so it's not anything

52
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,400
that has to do with see I don't think it reaches I think the breach is that they

53
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,680
have Deutsche has limits that it's normally supposed to be staying with

54
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,080
him so right a breach is when they go over below yeah those thresholds and

55
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,240
breaches I understand but I'm saying this if we can see how much money Don's

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
good banks owed to Deutsche or Deutsche's owed to Don's good bank and we can

57
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,280
sort of cross-reference with 150 billion that's being reported today you

58
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,160
might have a timeline that we can create from that yeah I understand what you're

59
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,920
saying I don't have the capacity to do that I've spent so many hours looking at

60
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:39,480
this yeah and it okay well show it to your expert friend with I will yeah I

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,760
will do that I mean maybe that's something to say it could be just shot in

62
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,720
the dark it might be worthless but it's worth just you know having once a look

63
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,240
over a quick look over I mean am I right or am I wrong I don't know yeah there

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,040
could be something there I mean I've had a I've spent a lot of time with this guy

65
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,360
there's and I think his view is that this is interesting because it shows the

66
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,360
variety of places that Deutsche was doing a ton of business with and it was

67
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,920
more than he thought especially as it related to Russia but was he at all

68
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,640
looking at it through the lens of Don's good bank and what was what's been

69
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,520
happening recently is this before all this is before dawn so now we have

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
something that might be helpful for that and again David I would like to say for

71
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,920
a year I've been telling you about this Don's good bank stuff here and you've

72
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,160
been saying it's it's silly it's silly but every time there's a new article

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,440
about it and now there's we have some a spreadsheet that shows that I was not so

74
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,800
silly you're not there's nothing silly about no I mean about my my referencing

75
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,400
this the spreadsheet in relation to Don's good banks relationship to Deutsche

76
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,760
bank I think there's something here I hear you okay and the guys that Glenn

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,480
hired said that this is interesting from a top completely different reason you're

78
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,080
telling me that I'm asking you that is that what he said no and we're gonna

79
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,200
shut that because we can't get into that that's we don't say the names or even

80
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:20,880
reference okay so yeah okay should we should we start doing a little yeah

81
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,840
let's just get to yeah how do you want to do this let's start the beginning and

82
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,720
just go through the whole thing I just read it to you yes I'll read it to you

83
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,960
yes and you can restore chocolate in a pillow yeah exactly if you have a roaring

84
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:44,840
fire yes it'd be lovely um that train that yeah raise that train raise that

85
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:58,160
here yeah I think it's a champion way over you know I've an idea let me I'm

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:13,240
just gonna pause you guys don't have 80% for me

87
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,320
except we'll eat up

88
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,260
you

89
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:57,780
All right, well, maybe we can just delete all that and just start again.

90
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,780
No, no, no.

91
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
It was like a test.

92
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
It's fine.

93
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,780
No, there's...

94
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,260
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to bring up that guy.

95
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,140
Yeah, just don't bring up any specifics about sources, because not because it's like...

96
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,140
But did you see what I was doing?

97
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,180
I was like making it look like that was a separate entity from the one that you could

98
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
join.

99
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
It's fine.

100
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
It's...

101
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,980
I was muddying the water, specifically, because I knew that's the guy you're referring

102
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
to.

103
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
So I made it look like this is a separate person.

104
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Got it.

105
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
Okay.

106
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Back up.

107
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Yes.

108
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
It's obfuscating.

109
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
This source.

110
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
Let's not obfuscate anything.

111
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Yes, it is.

112
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
That's obfuscating.

113
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
No, no, I'm not saying you're not obfuscating.

114
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
I'm saying let's not obfuscate.

115
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
Oh, okay.

116
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,980
Okay, so...

117
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Okay.

118
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,980
So there are a couple of ways we can do this.

119
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
Yes.

120
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
One is...

121
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:45,980
In the way I've got this organized right now on my computer is...

122
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,980
Just a bunch of things in kind of roughly chronological order.

123
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
And I've actually kept out.

124
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
I've made kind of a document here for myself.

125
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
Can I see that?

126
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,980
Can you send me an outline to go through?

127
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,980
No.

128
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
Oh, come on.

129
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,980
No, we're not going to do that.

130
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
Because it's just like clips from them.

131
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,980
It's like paragraphs that I've cut and pasted into a separate document for the book.

132
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Yeah, that's fine.

133
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
I can get that.

134
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Yeah, not sure you'd love that.

135
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
But we're not going to do that right now.

136
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Okay.

137
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,980
So basically the way I've got this organized is in chronological order of like your dad's

138
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
life onward.

139
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,980
So like your dad is born on November 5th, 1955.

140
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Okay.

141
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,980
And we...

142
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,980
By the way, do we know if he was...

143
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
He was...

144
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
There are six kids, right?

145
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,980
And was he number three or number four?

146
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,980
So there was Laura and then Peter.

147
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,980
Or sorry, Laura, John, Peter, my dad.

148
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Okay, so he was fourth.

149
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Yeah.

150
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Okay.

151
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
And then Sam and then Bob.

152
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,980
And then Sam and Bob.

153
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Okay.

154
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,980
So what I'm not going to do unless you really want to is go through like absolutely everything

155
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,980
because there's a lot...

156
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
I would like to go through absolutely everything, yes.

157
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
You really want...

158
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
Yes.

159
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,980
The reason I say no is because a lot of this is stuff you've told me.

160
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
So it's like...

161
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Yeah.

162
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,980
I would like to see how you have...

163
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
You're not going to really see how...

164
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Reinterpreted what I told you.

165
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,980
It's not really...

166
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,980
Or reductively...

167
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,980
Okay.

168
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Well, that's fine.

169
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,980
We can go through this in some detail.

170
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
So...

171
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Okay.

172
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Okay.

173
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:29,980
Well, actually, first of all, let's go through the moment, the day on January 26th, 2014,

174
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
which...

175
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Is that today?

176
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
No.

177
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
That's almost exactly five years ago.

178
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Today is January 25th.

179
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Okay.

180
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:49,980
So you get out of the tube station, drizzling, you're in Sloan Square.

181
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,980
You had the previous night been jamming with your band.

182
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,980
And you have told me in the past that you just woke up that morning not feeling probably

183
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
the greatest.

184
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
It was more than jamming.

185
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Yeah.

186
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,980
It was a show, I think, and then there was a party.

187
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,980
And I didn't fall asleep until maybe five or six a.m.

188
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
I remember.

189
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,980
I was with Beth.

190
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
Yeah.

191
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
Okay.

192
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Let me grab some water.

193
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
Yeah.

194
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Go on.

195
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Sorry.

196
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
I'm listening.

197
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Well, I just want to...

198
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
That's fine.

199
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,980
So you...

200
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,980
You felt like some sort of negative energy when you were on the tube.

201
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
Yeah.

202
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
It was very...

203
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
Can you just come back here?

204
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Yeah.

205
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
Sorry.

206
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
I just...

207
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
No, I know.

208
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
That's...

209
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Well, no.

210
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,980
I don't even need you to.

211
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,980
This is kind of what I'm saying.

212
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Like, there's...

213
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:53,980
I don't really feel a need to fact check this kind of stuff with you right now because

214
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,980
it's...

215
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,980
This is coming straight from your mouth on 15 different occasions.

216
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
So...

217
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,980
Okay.

218
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,980
Okay.

219
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
So maybe we should...

220
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
You're wearing a hat, no.

221
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
Okay.

222
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,980
You don't like the idea of tube bald, man?

223
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
No, okay.

224
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Let's be tube bald, guys.

225
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Okay.

226
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
All right.

227
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
So, yeah.

228
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:24,980
So I was on the tube and I remember feeling this like overwhelming dark, terrible, foreboding

229
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
thing.

230
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
It wasn't foreboding, actually.

231
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
It was more...

232
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,980
Because foreboding would be for the future, but this was like in the moment.

233
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:39,980
And I thought maybe it was just like an echo of my lack of sleep and misery waking up early

234
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
for me to get down there.

235
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,980
But no, it was like a really dark sort of terribleness.

236
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
It's very hard to describe.

237
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
And you think that...

238
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,980
It's like a visual sort of thing as well.

239
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
It's very strange.

240
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,980
And I thought I was picking up from someone on the tube, you know, because sometimes,

241
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,980
you know, you're on the tube and you pick up other people's like sort of pathology or

242
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
emotions or whatever.

243
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
And you're like, wait, that's not...

244
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Why am I feeling so...

245
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,980
And then you see the guy next to you like, oh.

246
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
You know.

247
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
And I was like, was there somebody...

248
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,980
But there wasn't anybody around me that was giving off this sort of terrible...

249
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,980
In hindsight, you think that was the moment your dad died?

250
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,980
Yeah.

251
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,980
In hindsight, yeah.

252
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,980
I wrote it down in my notes and I keep meaning to find it, but I still haven't done that

253
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
because I don't really want to look at it.

254
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,980
But I will do that if you can remind me.

255
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
Okay.

256
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
So...

257
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Because at the time, every time I would have an idea or something, because I was still

258
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
writing music at that time.

259
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,980
And I would write down thoughts or ideas I had and that one was overwhelmingly strong.

260
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,980
So I wrote it down, like everything about it.

261
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,980
I didn't think much about that until months later.

262
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Yeah.

263
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
All right.

264
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
So you get out of the tube.

265
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
It's drizzly.

266
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
You are...

267
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,980
You walk over to the Satya Gallery.

268
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
It's one o'clock.

269
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,980
Parents aren't there.

270
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
You text them.

271
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,980
You text your mom and say, where are you?

272
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Where are you guys?

273
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
No response.

274
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Correct.

275
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,980
And you go then browse around the Tashin bookstore.

276
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
Yeah.

277
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Look at that Beatles book.

278
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
That's right.

279
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,980
And then who...

280
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
And then your phone rings.

281
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,980
And then the phone rings.

282
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
Well, there was a few more texts.

283
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Where are you?

284
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,980
What's going on?

285
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
I'm here.

286
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
And they're usually never late.

287
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
I'm always the one that's late.

288
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
So...

289
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
And I was early this time, which is unusual.

290
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
That is...

291
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
I can vouch from personal experience.

292
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,980
That's unusual.

293
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Yeah.

294
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,980
And I was looking through the book and I was trying to figure out a way for them to talk

295
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,980
my dad or mom into buying me this for my birthday.

296
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,980
And yeah, send multiple texts.

297
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,980
And then the phone call came in and I believe it said unknown or no caller ID.

298
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
I'm not sure.

299
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Which was also strange because if it was my mom or my dad, it would come up as mom or

300
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
dad.

301
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
And it was a voice.

302
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,980
It was very hard to recognize and a very strong Russian accent.

303
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,980
And I think it was the housekeeper or one of the housekeeper's friends or somebody.

304
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
I don't.

305
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
It was very fuzzy stuff.

306
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
What did the voice say?

307
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Emergency, emergency.

308
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Your father or your father.

309
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Well, your story is aligning perfectly with what I've got written here.

310
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,980
So that's good.

311
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
Of course.

312
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
You go into...

313
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
You grab a...

314
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
You hail cab.

315
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
Yeah.

316
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
I get a black cab.

317
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,980
It was raining a bit, I remember.

318
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,980
And you get to 21 Evelyn Gardens and hop out of the cab.

319
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,980
Was there an ambulance there?

320
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
There was, yeah.

321
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,980
And so then what do you do?

322
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,980
That's when I knew that it was, you know, somewhat for real that there was something going on.

323
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Just a verifiable ambulance.

324
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,980
You don't see an ambulance combined with emergency, emergency, you know.

325
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,980
I just ran out of the cab.

326
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,980
I paid the guy, remember, and ran out of the cab, ran up the stairs.

327
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,980
And I already told you all this.

328
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,980
I know, but it's good to just like...

329
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
It's actually helpful for me.

330
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
Like, do you not want to?

331
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
We don't have to.

332
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
I mean, this is the same thing.

333
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,980
So, yeah, I get in there, I open the door, and my dad was dead and he's on the floor,

334
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
lying on his back in the hallway.

335
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,980
The EMTs were there, and they were finishing up.

336
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,980
They were wrapping up their instruments, and my mom was wailing.

337
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
The current crying tears.

338
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Very terrible scene.

339
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Terrible.

340
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
Did you know he was dead?

341
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,980
I kind of just instinctively knew, you know, I mean, just when you see the scenes.

342
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Yeah, I can imagine.

343
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,980
Okay, let's move on.

344
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm sorry to have to, like, start out with it.

345
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
Okay.

346
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
You're not sorry.

347
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
Well, dude, I can tell...

348
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
I know you well enough that I, like, know...

349
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,980
I mean, I've heard the story a million times, obviously, but it's...

350
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,980
I don't enjoy running through the camera.

351
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
I know you're kidding.

352
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
It honestly is.

353
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,980
Don't worry, I'm just...

354
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
I'm not worried.

355
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
...giving you shit.

356
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Okay, so...

357
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
So what are the details? Do we need...

358
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
I don't think we need to go into any more details right there.

359
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
I then kind of fast-forward a little bit.

360
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,980
What were the police and the notes? I mean, you have all that, right?

361
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Yeah, I've got that, but I'm not going to get into that.

362
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Why don't you tell me what you have, and then I will tell you if something is correct or incorrect,

363
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,980
rather than me saying the same thing I've been telling you for four years?

364
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,980
Okay, because it's really the way you have processed the information that's important,

365
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,980
not the information I give you again.

366
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Yep, fair enough.

367
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Okay, so let's rewind 55 or 60 years.

368
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Okay.

369
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,980
And so it...

370
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,980
Bill's grandfather, your great-grandfather,

371
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,980
there's a guy named John Shaw Brooksman.

372
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Yeah.

373
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
And he started off being a sheep rancher.

374
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Okay.

375
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
Do you know that?

376
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
No, Gar.

377
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
Gar?

378
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
I think they call him Gar.

379
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
I don't know.

380
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
I...

381
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
He gave sheep ranching a try.

382
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Oh, wait, on whose side?

383
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,980
On my...

384
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
This is your dad's...

385
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
Mother's side?

386
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Dad's...

387
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
grandfather.

388
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,980
So it's paternal.

389
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,980
So his father's father?

390
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
His father's father, yes.

391
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Okay, Jack's father.

392
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
So this is not Reverend Jack.

393
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
This is Reverend Jack's dad.

394
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,980
Yeah, no, this isn't different.

395
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,980
Gar is Jack's wife's father.

396
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,980
So your great-grandfather, Reverend Jack's dad,

397
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
becomes...

398
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
There's some great...

399
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Like he wrote about his experience,

400
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,980
because he, for something back in 1906,

401
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
which I tracked down,

402
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,980
and he, after becoming a sheep rancher,

403
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,980
decided to be a banker,

404
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
and worked at a bank in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

405
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,980
and he started at the very bottom.

406
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,980
He was washing windows and scrubbing floors.

407
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,980
For your...

408
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
This was...

409
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
He described this.

410
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,980
This is probably, I guess, the late 1800s,

411
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,980
because he wrote about this in 1906.

412
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Massachusetts?

413
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
No, in Iowa.

414
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
In Iowa? Okay.

415
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
He said,

416
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
all the money that fell on the floor went to me,

417
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,980
and for a while, it was pretty poor picking.

418
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,980
But he spent his career there,

419
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
and they were in banking,

420
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,980
and eventually he ended up

421
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,980
at a big Chicago bank, Harris Trust.

422
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,980
And by the Great Depression,

423
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,980
he had enough kind of seniority

424
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,980
that he was summoned to testify in Washington

425
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,980
before the big Senate committee,

426
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
the PCORA Commission,

427
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,980
that was investigating.

428
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,980
It was like, basically,

429
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
the financial crisis inquiry commission

430
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
80 years earlier.

431
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980
What was this crisis over?

432
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
The Great Depression.

433
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
Oh, the Great Depression.

434
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,980
Yeah, so it was like the 1929 stock market crash,

435
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
and then they ensue in the Depression.

436
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,980
So, John, the banker as a son,

437
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Jack, John Jr.

438
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,980
And the daughter.

439
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Yeah.

440
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Well, but for this kind of branch of the family tree,

441
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
the son is relevant.

442
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
So this is Reverend Jack.

443
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
He's not Reverend Jack at first.

444
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,980
At first, he's a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II,

445
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,980
sinks a U-boat.

446
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,980
Jack, Marys Jane,

447
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,980
who's a librarian and an amateur artist,

448
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,980
they then have six children.

449
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,980
And in the middle, number four is your dad.

450
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
And Jane's background is interesting, too.

451
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,980
I know, it is interesting.

452
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
She's got, and she was Yale as well.

453
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
Vassar.

454
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
Or Vassar, yeah, Vassar.

455
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
She's an intellectual family.

456
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Very, yeah.

457
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
Yep.

458
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
Yeah.

459
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Gar was her father.

460
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,980
Okay.

461
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,980
He's one of the school of Prescott Bush.

462
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
Interesting.

463
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Yeah.

464
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,980
At Yale.

465
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,980
So Jack goes into the ministry

466
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,980
with the United Church of Christ.

467
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Initially, he's in Galva, Illinois.

468
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
Yeah, that's right.

469
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,980
And it was,

470
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Jane gave art lectures there.

471
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Laura, so Bill's older sister

472
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,980
did some music performances there.

473
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
And there were, you know,

474
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,980
old newspaper records of this.

475
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Right.

476
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,980
And Reverend Jack was known in the community as,

477
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,980
just like, not only like a pillar of the community,

478
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,980
but also someone who would,

479
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
he taught about the importance of understanding things

480
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,980
from other people's perspectives.

481
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Right.

482
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
And this is something that,

483
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,980
your dad would later tell people that it's,

484
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,980
this is kind of one of the guiding principles in his life

485
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,980
that he learned was from Reverend Jack.

486
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,980
And so they lived in Galva on this quiet,

487
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
tree-lined street,

488
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,980
old two-story house that had been built in the Great Depression.

489
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Bob later would say that there was a certain amount

490
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,980
of education pedigree, but there wasn't any money.

491
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
And they would, you know,

492
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
cycle through all these different communities

493
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,980
and to different churches.

494
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
Bob told you this.

495
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
No.

496
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,980
I've heard this from a couple of other people, though.

497
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,980
And Jane would decorate the houses

498
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
with watercolors that she would paint.

499
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Sure.

500
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
She's good.

501
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
She's good.

502
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,980
So, Bill starts to grow up

503
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,980
and he has a newspaper route.

504
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,980
Gets his two younger brothers to stuff the papers.

505
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
Right, the newspaper route.

506
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
That's right, I forgot about that.

507
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
With like little pamphlets and do,

508
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,980
deliver them and Bill takes the money and saves it

509
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
and uses the money to buy a TV

510
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,980
that Reverend Jack had been unwilling to buy.

511
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
He goes to League Forest,

512
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,980
which is a, you know, elite prep school in the Chicago area.

513
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,980
He goes to Clark Men's College,

514
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,980
which is where I, 25 years later, would go.

515
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
And my sister would go, too.

516
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
And your sister would go.

517
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,980
And this is where your dance life gets a little bit,

518
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
not what I'd expected.

519
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,980
So he is, he is a big party-er.

520
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Really?

521
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
A very big party.

522
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Is he?

523
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,980
He was known as a binge drinker, pot smoker.

524
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,980
He, his friends would tease him about his preference

525
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,980
for what at the time were exotic women.

526
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,980
And also his preference for like, you know,

527
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,980
what was, well, they called him Billy Disco

528
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,980
because he really was cool in the gang.

529
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
I didn't know that one.

530
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Billy Disco?

531
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
That's funny.

532
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,980
One of the things I've done is

533
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,980
I talked to a bunch of his college, old college friends.

534
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
Billy Disco?

535
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
That's fucking funny.

536
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
So they would, you know,

537
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,980
and I get into a little bit about

538
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,980
kind of the extracurricular activities they had.

539
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,980
And, well, you know,

540
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,980
there's like a dingy San Diego strip club

541
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
that they would go to that bill would later describe.

542
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
I think this is in the emails that you've showed me.

543
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,980
How they would slip dollar bills

544
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
into the G strings of heroin addicts.

545
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,980
There is a Vegas was a popular destination

546
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
as it was in my time when I went to CMC as well.

547
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Yeah.

548
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,980
And so despite all of his like, kind of wild side,

549
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
he was also a really good student.

550
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,980
He was really into finance, even at,

551
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
the two things he was really into at that time

552
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
were politics and finance.

553
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
And he understood finance in this kind of like,

554
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,980
oddly sophisticated way for someone who was, you know,

555
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
a 20-year-old.

556
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
Well, he wanted to be a sports writer as well.

557
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Yeah.

558
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
He wanted to be a journalist.

559
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,980
And so, well, listen to this.

560
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,980
So he, he was kind of getting,

561
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
getting some of his buddies in college

562
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,980
interested in stock trading and even in like little,

563
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,980
like very simple types of derivatives,

564
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
even at that age.

565
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,980
And how would Bill, who grew up without any money

566
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,980
and was on scholarship at CMC,

567
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,980
how would he make his own bets?

568
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
How would he finance that?

569
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Well, he developed a fairly lucrative career,

570
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,980
writing term papers, term papers for other students.

571
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,980
He never told me this.

572
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,980
The way his friend, one of his best friends at the time,

573
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,980
John Shink, who's a classmate of his,

574
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,980
describes it as, it was mostly for some of the more

575
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,980
privileged students there.

576
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,980
And he says, quote, there are a lot of people

577
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,980
who wouldn't have made it through Claremont

578
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
if it wasn't for Bill's help.

579
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
That's funny.

580
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
So, really into politics, after graduating,

581
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,980
he did some campaign work for local Republicans

582
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,980
running for Congress while he was there,

583
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
while he was in college.

584
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,980
And after graduating, he lived in Pasadena

585
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
with a group of his friends.

586
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,980
And he and John Shink set up a consulting firm.

587
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,980
They produced position papers for a bunch of candidates

588
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,980
and basically for a bunch of Republican candidates

589
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
all throughout California.

590
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,980
And, but again, his like, his demons came out at night.

591
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,980
So, why do you say demons?

592
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Because he was into, there's a lot of heavy drinking.

593
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
There were prostitutes.

594
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
But why is this your drinking with demons?

595
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
Why is this demonic now?

596
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Why is this a negative connotation?

597
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
I don't think it's, it's not demonic.

598
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
It's that, it's an expression.

599
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Yeah, I know the expression, this is your negative expression

600
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
to say your demons come out at night

601
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
because you like to party, you like to drink.

602
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Well, he was known as...

603
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
It's a bit unfair.

604
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
Okay.

605
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,980
He, he just didn't know how to turn it off.

606
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,980
John Shink says another one.

607
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
Tom Marks, who's another Claremont alum,

608
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,980
and this is a guy, they then moved to Chicago

609
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
and this was his roommate at the time.

610
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
Okay.

611
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,980
Bill was wonderfully brilliant but deeply troubled.

612
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,980
In clinical terms, he was incredibly fucked up.

613
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,980
He did things by day that were not,

614
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,980
that were in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior.

615
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
I'm sorry, he did things by night

616
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
that were in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior.

617
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,980
And it, uh...

618
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
He's a proper person.

619
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,980
Yeah, he is a proper person.

620
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
There's, there's...

621
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,980
And look, and listen, so he...

622
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
What's, why is that...

623
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
What's wrong with that?

624
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
And why was it clinically fucked up

625
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,980
because that is the opposite of clinical?

626
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,980
I think that's a turn of phrase by his friend.

627
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
Oh, it's a quote.

628
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,980
Again, that's not my words.

629
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,980
Those are, those are his roommate's words at the time.

630
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Whoever this guy is is...

631
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Okay.

632
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
No, this is, this is two or three different people, though,

633
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,980
now who are being quoted.

634
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,980
Whoever said clinically fucked up is...

635
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,980
He said in clinical terms, he was incredibly fucked up.

636
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,980
That's, it's a...

637
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Like, obviously...

638
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
In clinical terms, he's really fucked up.

639
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
No, that's like a joke.

640
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
I know, it's a terrible joke.

641
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
It's, it's not funny.

642
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
The, but here, look, there's another side to this

643
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,980
because this guy's also, Bill stands out,

644
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,980
your father stands out as the mature one in the group.

645
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,980
And when he says it's in sharp contrast to his daytime behavior,

646
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
well his daytime behavior was, he was the responsible one.

647
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,980
Okay.

648
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,980
He, uh, he needed a car to get to work.

649
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Until he just went out and bought a used Mustang.

650
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,980
Yeah.

651
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,980
And it was like, he actually functioned in the real world.

652
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,980
And I can say, I know you can say it's like,

653
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,980
when recent graduates of college,

654
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
that is like not normal behavior, right?

655
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
It's like a whole, you have to get your parents involved

656
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
and like figure shit out.

657
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
He was figuring stuff out on his own.

658
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,980
When a colleague's wife died, Bill sent a sympathy card,

659
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
which would never recurred to his,

660
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
the people he's living with.

661
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
And his girlfriend says, quote,

662
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
I asked him why, and he said,

663
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
because it's what's done, it's the right thing to do.

664
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
That's right.

665
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
And most of us, Bill was self-sufficient and responsible.

666
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
I would hear a lot of that for him.

667
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Cause that's what you do.

668
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Yeah.

669
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
Cause that's what you do though.

670
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
You would say that often.

671
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Well, he had that going when he was 21 years old.

672
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
Yeah.

673
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Um,

674
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
Wow.

675
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,980
I've got a delightful little anecdote here that,

676
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,980
you know, it doesn't prove anything one way or the other,

677
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
but just interesting.

678
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
So in early 1980s,

679
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,980
Bill flies from Chicago to Vegas to have a little reunion

680
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
with John Shink.

681
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,980
So one of his best friends in college.

682
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,980
And, you know, they're drinking and gambling and it's late at night

683
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,980
and they're walking back down the strip toward their hotel.

684
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,980
And, uh, two prostitutes come up to them.

685
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,980
And, you know, these are two drunk 22 year olds or whatever.

686
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,980
So they're, uh, prostitutes or maybe 24 year olds.

687
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Uh, prostitutes, uh, walk up to them,

688
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
start fondling them a little bit.

689
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,980
Guys aren't putting up much of a fight.

690
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,980
And then the prostitutes walk away and Bill and,

691
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,980
uh, John are walking back toward their hotel room.

692
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Right.

693
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,980
And your dad realizes this whole thing had been a ruse.

694
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,980
The one of the prostitutes had stolen hundreds of dollars out of his pocket

695
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
while feeling him up.

696
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,980
And so Bill yells and then starts chasing them.

697
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,980
And he tackles one of them.

698
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
He tackles her.

699
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,980
And they are rolling around on a dirty sidewalk.

700
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
Bill trying to get his money back.

701
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,980
The prostitute gets presumably screaming until the cops came and broke it up.

702
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
That's funny.

703
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,980
Yeah.

704
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,980
Oh, that's great.

705
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Did he get the money back?

706
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
He got the money back.

707
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
The cops gave it back.

708
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
Gave him the money back.

709
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
Wow.

710
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Um, okay.

711
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,980
So, and again, I'm just doing this based on the way I've got this structured

712
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
right now.

713
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
So we're taking a little break chronologically.

714
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
That's great.

715
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
I didn't know that.

716
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,980
That's funny.

717
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,980
And we rewind to January 1976.

718
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
Bill's never told that story.

719
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,980
Never heard that.

720
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Um, so we go, you're born.

721
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Okay.

722
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
In Kiev.

723
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,980
Uh, to Allah and Alexander.

724
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,980
Um, I described that wonderful black and white photo that you have of them at the party.

725
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Um, are you going to include these photos?

726
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
I don't know.

727
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
I don't know.

728
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
I mean, you can, you can if you want.

729
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
Okay, cool.

730
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
That's good.

731
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
I don't really know how that works.

732
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,980
I think for these purposes, I think it would be good to be able to do that.

733
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Um, so, uh, Allah was, uh, I don't know if you know how much you know about this history

734
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,980
of Russian Jews in the seventies and early eighties.

735
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Yeah.

736
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,980
I mean, so they, she after get graduate from college follows like a felt a fairly well

737
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,980
worn path gets an Israeli exit visa, uh, goes to first Vienna and then Rome, which it's

738
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
weird.

739
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Like I never realized this until I started looking into your story.

740
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,980
Like that's a million other people did the exact same thing.

741
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Not just leaving Russia, but going to Vienna and then Rome and then getting waiting in

742
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,980
Rome for getting those exit visas or is not.

743
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Yeah.

744
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,980
It wasn't, you know, it wasn't easy.

745
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,980
But I heard the stories of selling my grandfather's medals and World War II medals and bribing

746
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
everyone along the way.

747
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
Yep.

748
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,980
And just looking, going back to like old news stories at the time, you can see people

749
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,980
like in very similar situation situations to your family at the time, like fleeing for

750
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,980
the same reason and following the exact same geographical path.

751
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,980
And so, uh, and in fact, a lot of them ending up in Chicago as well, which is obviously.

752
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
That's strange.

753
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
Why Chicago of all places?

754
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:19,980
I think it's just the, I mean, there's a local newspaper in 1978 or 1979 actually, which

755
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,980
is the same year your family arrived there, uh, described it as this is a local community

756
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,980
leader or the head of the Jewish community centers in Chicago told the local newspaper

757
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
that it's a mass exodus.

758
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
They're all coming here.

759
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Um, so this is where things get a little bit ugly as you know.

760
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,980
And, um, so your mom is working in the Stanley Corsac department store.

761
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Your mom gets a job.

762
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
She has two jobs.

763
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,980
One is a cocktail waitress and the other is working in this luxury good store on the

764
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,980
magnificent mile in Chicago.

765
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,980
This is this store is called Stanley Corsac.

766
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,980
Right.

767
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
She was selling for coats.

768
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,980
And I think her job actually as far as I can tell was creating displays.

769
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,980
So she was, um, right?

770
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
Yeah.

771
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
She did the windows.

772
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
Yeah.

773
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,980
The window displays exactly.

774
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
Well, that's okay.

775
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,980
Uh, Marie, you know the jewels are?

776
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,980
I saw some over on some of those little pop mango pods over there where my phone plugged

777
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
in.

778
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
Yeah.

779
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
Yeah.

780
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,980
The actual.

781
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,980
And also we need to.

782
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980
Here I'm just going to.

783
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,980
Right.

784
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
Okay.

785
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,980
You got to keep a secret.

786
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
Okay.

787
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
It's off.

788
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
Okay.

789
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
So we'll just be careful.

790
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Wait.

791
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,980
Sorry.

792
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
Say that again.

793
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,980
I'm not mentioning Marie.

794
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Yeah.

795
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,980
Yeah.

796
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,980
Totally.

797
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
I mean, that's not chronologically.

798
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,980
That's like the very end of the pace we're going.

799
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
We'll get there in about two weeks.

800
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Oh, okay.

801
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
So we're very careful talking to the camera.

802
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,980
So we don't know who you are.

803
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Oh, I see.

804
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
So you.

805
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Oh, shit.

806
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
So I, that's actually a good point.

807
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
I walked in here and was like, hi, Marie.

808
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,980
Yeah.

809
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,980
It's fine.

810
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
I mean, there's no.

811
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Yeah.

812
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Because.

813
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
For now.

814
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
Well, she might.

815
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,980
I don't know.

816
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
It's fine.

817
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Don't worry.

818
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
I totally know what you're saying.

819
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
And that's not.

820
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
Yeah.

821
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,980
We just want to protect her for now until.

822
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,980
We just let my mom.

823
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,980
Um.

824
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
All that is not good.

825
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
I'm just here.

826
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
This thing.

827
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
She's not going to see that.

828
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
I mean.

829
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
This is going to like be what?

830
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Let's do it.

831
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,980
That's actually happened.

832
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
It's going to be watched by a lot of people.

833
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
But not.

834
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
It's going to be in conjunction with.

835
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
Yeah.

836
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
But it's not like imminent in both control.

837
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Over.

838
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

839
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
We're.

840
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
I like the word.

841
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
It's not imminent.

842
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
Um.

843
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
But just be careful.

844
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
Would you want me to get.

845
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
I couldn't get to the cafe.

846
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
No.

847
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
No.

848
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
I just mean.

849
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Like.

850
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
I mentioned.

851
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
No.

852
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
The other jewels.

853
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
And all of a sudden.

854
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Like someone.

855
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,980
Honestly, they do.

856
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980
I.

857
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Marie.

858
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
Like.

859
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,980
But it fell.

860
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
By the time this airs.

861
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
Let's say.

862
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,980
Well, but.

863
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
But just to be clear.

864
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
In again, the camera's off right now.

865
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
So.

866
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Although your phone might still be recorded.

867
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
It's still.

868
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
Just turn it off.

869
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
Okay.

870
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Um.
