1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
So, she had a very, yeah, very small recital.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,120
It's a big deal for her.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,200
Of course it is, I know.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
And she understands that when work comes up, I have to go.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,560
But, you know, at the very least, what I should do,

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,520
like, you know, I should please go back.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,560
And, you know, I got her a little something from L.A.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
Oh, that's so cute.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,480
I can catch her before she goes back to sleep.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,760
But that's why I can't tell.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,960
You know, I would love to come right now.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,320
I'm seriously trying to catch her to the airport myself,

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,880
which I don't know if I'll make the flight,

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,720
but I at least want to make the effort to see if I can.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,560
Okay, I see.

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,200
Well, if you don't,

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
you actually, once you're at the airport,

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,480
you're not too far from where we are.

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
Come here, like seriously.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
Just come.

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,840
Oh, no, I appreciate that.

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,320
And then we're gonna have to, like, don't,

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,200
I mean, if you want, not, obviously if you want.

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,440
But yeah, there is actually traffic, traffic is back.

25
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,440
So, I don't know how long you've allowed yourself.

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,840
It's gonna be very close, unfortunately.

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,800
Well, okay.

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,400
Well, you know, you have a plan B.

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,960
It's easier, so.

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,880
At worst, I'll give you a call.

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,560
I'll tell you I'm stopping by, but.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,520
No, seriously.

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,160
Yeah, do that.

34
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,080
You might not make it.

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,560
Sounds like you might not make it.

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,160
You know, right now I am sitting in a good bit of traffic

37
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,960
on the 405, so it may take a little while.

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,080
But I also wanted to tell you just about,

39
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,000
so we had a very good conversation with Val

40
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,560
and, you know, we got to learn some things

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,880
and he got to learn some things from us.

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
So, the other thing I also wanted to tell you,

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,160
which I told you on Sunday as well, you and Val,

44
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,520
is that there are some things that he may not be able

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,600
to tell you directly about.

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,520
I know you guys have a very open and honest relationship,

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,360
which is perfect.

48
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,880
I would want nothing less from both of you.

49
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,520
But there's some things that he's gonna talk to about us,

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
you know, with us and the things that he's interested in,

51
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,360
that you would not share with me.

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,920
Yeah, yeah, no, I understand.

53
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,360
Yeah, and that's just for everyone's protection.

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,520
That's mainly for you because if you know about it,

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,000
then you could become a witness and I don't want that.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,200
You know, it's really, it's no danger to me

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,840
because it doesn't really affect me much,

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,000
but it's more like if you know about it too,

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,240
then if it's something that has to be testified, you know,

60
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,680
then when they ask, does anyone else know about it?

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
I think there's, oh yeah, I felt like, you know,

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
like, is it your girlfriend or is it wife?

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760
Yes, I'm currently in this divorce proceeding, so.

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,080
Of course, yeah.

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
Yeah.

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,200
So anyway, so you know, I talk to my girlfriend

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,280
and then they say, okay, well, we need to subpoena her.

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,960
And then you have to be on the witness ban too

69
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,440
to answer questions, to validate some things.

70
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,880
And that's not good, that's not good for anyone.

71
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,000
Because your identity is out there and anyway, so.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,480
I know, you can, oh, okay, no, no,

73
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,880
you can trust in me, I won't ask questions

74
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
and whatever he tells me, he tells me,

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,120
I won't torture him for that.

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
Of course, of course.

77
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Okay.

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
And you have my number too, it's like,

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,200
what I was telling Val is that if you independently,

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
like say Val is out or something like that,

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
and you know, you think he says, oh hey,

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,080
I'm gonna go work with David,

83
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,720
you can call me at the, hey, you know,

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,080
is he okay, is he all right, and I'll tell you, of course,

85
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
like yeah, he's fine, he's safe.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
And then if we decide to work together,

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,920
right now, I have to find something for him to do,

88
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,600
but it's nothing that I would directly

89
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,360
be working with him on, so.

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Okay.

91
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Anyway, we'll be on the witness ban.

92
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,600
He's a very talented man, he's got many talents.

93
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,520
Yes, I agree, I hear he's got a lot of talent

94
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
and lots of skills.

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Yes, he's got a set, a wide range of skills.

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
Yeah, I know he's got a lot of talent.

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,080
As you do too, I'm sure.

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,560
No, not me, I've got a very limited number of skills

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,520
and unfortunately, I need help,

100
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,440
I need help from everyone to do the things we do,

101
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,960
so I appreciate Val's help going in to help us out,

102
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,720
so hopefully we can find him something to work on.

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
Right now, I'm gonna have to go back and ask some people

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,640
and see what they say and see if anyone has any interest.

105
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,600
And I told Val, and like I'm telling you,

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,520
I can't promise that we'll have anything

107
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,080
for him to work on, but he has my number too,

108
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,160
so maybe something else comes up and says,

109
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,080
hey, I've got some good information on this or that,

110
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,560
okay, and then we try to find a good home for it,

111
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,440
but up until then, it's kind of up in the air

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,680
unfortunately, so we'll see how things go.

113
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Okay, and you're happy with your trip and your research

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,480
and what you wanted to achieve?

115
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, yeah, I mean, my job today

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,200
was just to see what Val's skills were,

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,920
like you said, he's a very talented person,

118
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,760
he has a lot of good friends, a lot of good access,

119
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,960
so those are the things that my job is just to go and see,

120
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,520
and then I go up and write a report and I tell everyone,

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,240
okay, well maybe he can help on that or maybe he can help

122
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,360
on that, but like I said, I don't have anything personally

123
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,520
that I would work with him on because that's not my thing,

124
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,120
so anyway, that's my main job,

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,080
it's just to test and see how things go

126
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,920
and then they work out great,

127
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,040
and if not, you know, we still keep the line open

128
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,000
and you can always call him saying he's got more access

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,680
or he's got something else and we're good to go,

130
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,400
but yeah, and we need to talk about Marl,

131
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm sure Val will tell you all the details about it,

132
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
and it is an unfortunate situation

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,040
he got like deep in the 70s because I understand

134
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
if someone was trying to take a child,

135
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
it is the worst thing that you can imagine,

136
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,360
it's also so bizarre, I mean,

137
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,960
it's the, here and see, the, you know,

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,800
I mean, there's certain situation that you can like,

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,240
well, you know, that brings that,

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,280
that will bring that consequence,

141
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,120
but that's not the case, you know, I mean,

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,560
there's certain terrain, you know,

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,360
you can put in terrain that the certain kind of seeds

144
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,400
that bring certain kind of plants,

145
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,160
and that's just not the case here,

146
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
there's no reason for that, and so,

147
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,880
it's very baffling, you know.

148
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,920
And so, yeah, I know, I know.

149
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,640
And I think, I mean, the best thing I can say is,

150
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,680
I know it sounds, you know, of course you wanna relax,

151
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,960
but the deep breaths when things get stressful

152
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,040
and things will work out,

153
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,160
will help you guys as best we can.

154
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,000
Right.

155
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,600
What I told Val is,

156
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,080
I know you guys fired your last attorney

157
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,840
because something was weird with that guy,

158
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,640
but hopefully, you're able to find a good attorney,

159
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm gonna do some work to see if I can help

160
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
and find a good attorney,

161
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
I'll just give you, you know,

162
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,320
I'll just give you a recommendation,

163
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
but yeah, of course.

164
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,960
And then, but once you get a good attorney,

165
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,000
I think you guys will be in a better spot, so, anyway.

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Hey, hey guys, sorry, hey, the other half of the cannoli.

167
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,400
I came in the room just now.

168
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm eating your cannoli.

169
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I was gonna save you a cannoli, David,

170
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
but I'm gonna eat it now.

171
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,760
Well, I think he might miss the flight.

172
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Oh, really?

173
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
He might miss the flight?

174
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
Oh, dude, come over.

175
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
You should really miss the flight.

176
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,360
You might have half a cannoli.

177
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,960
Oh, trust me.

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,040
I would love to come over

179
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,760
because eating your deliciously,

180
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,120
you know, home cooked food is better than my carton meal,

181
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
which is nothing.

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,040
She's good, dude.

183
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
She's so good.

184
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,120
So, I would say I would love to eat with you guys.

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,640
I absolutely would rather eat than jump on a flight

186
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,200
and go hungry the whole night,

187
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,240
but at the same time, I think my daughter

188
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
hopefully will appreciate this one day.

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,960
That's the-

190
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,280
I mean, kids, you have, David.

191
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
You can just put one so far.

192
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Oh, okay, okay.

193
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,120
Oh, cool.

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,200
Yeah, well, see how you go?

195
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,920
If the plane is not there,

196
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,400
you can't do anything about it.

197
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Yeah, just come over.

198
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
You can crash upstairs to have an extra bedroom.

199
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,880
You have many skills,

200
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,000
but you can't-

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,440
Tell me, you can crash upstairs too.

202
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
That's of course not.

203
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,120
You can crash upstairs.

204
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,280
Yes, and we have space.

205
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
This is a big place.

206
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
Yeah, you can crash upstairs.

207
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
There's lots of space.

208
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,240
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,080
You're-

210
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,360
Hey, if something comes up,

211
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
I will give you guys a call

212
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
and they'll take it over over

213
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
and then we'll have a meal.

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,600
But right now, hopefully,

215
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,440
I'll be able to get there

216
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,840
and be able to be funny and close.

217
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,040
Okay, see how you go?

218
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,960
Let us know.

219
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,920
Either way, this house is yours,

220
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,400
and voilà.

221
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
That would be cool.

222
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Okay.

223
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Thank you.

224
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Thanks, David.

225
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Let us know.

226
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Bon courage.

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Merci.

228
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Okay.

229
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
I'll talk to you guys later.

230
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Hopefully, you guys have a good night, okay?

231
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Okay.

232
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Thank you.

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Goodnight.

234
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Bye.

235
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Bye.

236
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Thank you.

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Bye.

238
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
He's a really nice guy.

239
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
He's like, you know,

240
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,360
I just want to tell you if Val does something,

241
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
he won't be able to tell you.

242
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
So, you can't ask him.

243
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
That's great.

244
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Because he's like,

245
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
because we don't want you to be compromised.

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Yeah, but what's going to happen to me?

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
She's going to think about fucking some people.

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Like, you know,

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
let me talk to her.

250
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
That's part of the job.

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
And look, we know Val,

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
this is not what you want,

253
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
but he will be part of it.

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Just don't tell her.

255
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
The Casanova spy?

256
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes.

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
That's the title.

258
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
The Casanova spy.
