WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
So, she had a very, yeah, very small recital.

00:03.440 --> 00:06.120
It's a big deal for her.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.200
Of course it is, I know.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.840
And she understands that when work comes up, I have to go.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.560
But, you know, at the very least, what I should do,

00:12.560 --> 00:14.520
like, you know, I should please go back.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.560
And, you know, I got her a little something from L.A.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.560
Oh, that's so cute.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.480
I can catch her before she goes back to sleep.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.760
But that's why I can't tell.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.960
You know, I would love to come right now.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.320
I'm seriously trying to catch her to the airport myself,

00:28.320 --> 00:29.880
which I don't know if I'll make the flight,

00:29.880 --> 00:32.720
but I at least want to make the effort to see if I can.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.560
Okay, I see.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.200
Well, if you don't,

00:35.200 --> 00:36.800
you actually, once you're at the airport,

00:36.800 --> 00:39.480
you're not too far from where we are.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.760
Come here, like seriously.

00:41.760 --> 00:42.600
Just come.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.840
Oh, no, I appreciate that.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.320
And then we're gonna have to, like, don't,

00:46.320 --> 00:50.200
I mean, if you want, not, obviously if you want.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.440
But yeah, there is actually traffic, traffic is back.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.440
So, I don't know how long you've allowed yourself.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.840
It's gonna be very close, unfortunately.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.800
Well, okay.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.400
Well, you know, you have a plan B.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.960
It's easier, so.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.880
At worst, I'll give you a call.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.560
I'll tell you I'm stopping by, but.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.520
No, seriously.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.160
Yeah, do that.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.080
You might not make it.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.560
Sounds like you might not make it.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.160
You know, right now I am sitting in a good bit of traffic

01:21.160 --> 01:23.960
on the 405, so it may take a little while.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.080
But I also wanted to tell you just about,

01:27.080 --> 01:29.000
so we had a very good conversation with Val

01:29.080 --> 01:31.560
and, you know, we got to learn some things

01:31.560 --> 01:32.880
and he got to learn some things from us.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.920
So, the other thing I also wanted to tell you,

01:35.920 --> 01:39.160
which I told you on Sunday as well, you and Val,

01:39.160 --> 01:41.520
is that there are some things that he may not be able

01:41.520 --> 01:42.600
to tell you directly about.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.520
I know you guys have a very open and honest relationship,

01:45.520 --> 01:46.360
which is perfect.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.880
I would want nothing less from both of you.

01:49.880 --> 01:53.520
But there's some things that he's gonna talk to about us,

01:53.520 --> 01:56.960
you know, with us and the things that he's interested in,

01:57.960 --> 01:59.360
that you would not share with me.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.920
Yeah, yeah, no, I understand.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.360
Yeah, and that's just for everyone's protection.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.520
That's mainly for you because if you know about it,

02:05.520 --> 02:09.000
then you could become a witness and I don't want that.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.200
You know, it's really, it's no danger to me

02:11.200 --> 02:12.840
because it doesn't really affect me much,

02:12.840 --> 02:15.000
but it's more like if you know about it too,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.240
then if it's something that has to be testified, you know,

02:18.240 --> 02:20.680
then when they ask, does anyone else know about it?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.360
I think there's, oh yeah, I felt like, you know,

02:22.360 --> 02:24.360
like, is it your girlfriend or is it wife?

02:25.360 --> 02:29.760
Yes, I'm currently in this divorce proceeding, so.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.080
Of course, yeah.

02:31.080 --> 02:31.920
Yeah.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.200
So anyway, so you know, I talk to my girlfriend

02:35.200 --> 02:38.280
and then they say, okay, well, we need to subpoena her.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.960
And then you have to be on the witness ban too

02:40.960 --> 02:44.440
to answer questions, to validate some things.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.880
And that's not good, that's not good for anyone.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.000
Because your identity is out there and anyway, so.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.480
I know, you can, oh, okay, no, no,

02:53.480 --> 02:55.880
you can trust in me, I won't ask questions

02:55.880 --> 02:57.360
and whatever he tells me, he tells me,

02:57.360 --> 03:00.120
I won't torture him for that.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.360
Of course, of course.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.200
Okay.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.360
And you have my number too, it's like,

03:05.360 --> 03:08.200
what I was telling Val is that if you independently,

03:08.200 --> 03:10.800
like say Val is out or something like that,

03:10.800 --> 03:13.200
and you know, you think he says, oh hey,

03:13.200 --> 03:15.080
I'm gonna go work with David,

03:15.080 --> 03:16.720
you can call me at the, hey, you know,

03:16.720 --> 03:19.080
is he okay, is he all right, and I'll tell you, of course,

03:19.080 --> 03:20.800
like yeah, he's fine, he's safe.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.720
And then if we decide to work together,

03:22.720 --> 03:26.920
right now, I have to find something for him to do,

03:26.920 --> 03:29.600
but it's nothing that I would directly

03:29.600 --> 03:31.360
be working with him on, so.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.200
Okay.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.200
Anyway, we'll be on the witness ban.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.600
He's a very talented man, he's got many talents.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.520
Yes, I agree, I hear he's got a lot of talent

03:41.520 --> 03:42.400
and lots of skills.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.400
Yes, he's got a set, a wide range of skills.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.480
Yeah, I know he's got a lot of talent.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.080
As you do too, I'm sure.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.560
No, not me, I've got a very limited number of skills

03:56.560 --> 03:58.520
and unfortunately, I need help,

03:58.520 --> 04:01.440
I need help from everyone to do the things we do,

04:01.440 --> 04:04.960
so I appreciate Val's help going in to help us out,

04:04.960 --> 04:08.720
so hopefully we can find him something to work on.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.120
Right now, I'm gonna have to go back and ask some people

04:11.120 --> 04:15.640
and see what they say and see if anyone has any interest.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.600
And I told Val, and like I'm telling you,

04:17.600 --> 04:19.520
I can't promise that we'll have anything

04:19.520 --> 04:22.080
for him to work on, but he has my number too,

04:22.080 --> 04:24.160
so maybe something else comes up and says,

04:24.160 --> 04:27.080
hey, I've got some good information on this or that,

04:27.080 --> 04:29.560
okay, and then we try to find a good home for it,

04:29.560 --> 04:33.440
but up until then, it's kind of up in the air

04:33.440 --> 04:35.680
unfortunately, so we'll see how things go.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.680
Okay, and you're happy with your trip and your research

04:40.880 --> 04:42.480
and what you wanted to achieve?

04:43.480 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, yeah, I mean, my job today

04:46.000 --> 04:48.200
was just to see what Val's skills were,

04:48.200 --> 04:49.920
like you said, he's a very talented person,

04:49.920 --> 04:52.760
he has a lot of good friends, a lot of good access,

04:52.760 --> 04:55.960
so those are the things that my job is just to go and see,

04:55.960 --> 04:59.520
and then I go up and write a report and I tell everyone,

04:59.520 --> 05:03.240
okay, well maybe he can help on that or maybe he can help

05:03.240 --> 05:07.360
on that, but like I said, I don't have anything personally

05:07.360 --> 05:11.520
that I would work with him on because that's not my thing,

05:11.640 --> 05:14.120
so anyway, that's my main job,

05:14.120 --> 05:17.080
it's just to test and see how things go

05:17.080 --> 05:18.920
and then they work out great,

05:18.920 --> 05:21.040
and if not, you know, we still keep the line open

05:21.040 --> 05:24.000
and you can always call him saying he's got more access

05:24.000 --> 05:26.680
or he's got something else and we're good to go,

05:26.680 --> 05:29.400
but yeah, and we need to talk about Marl,

05:29.400 --> 05:32.480
I'm sure Val will tell you all the details about it,

05:32.480 --> 05:34.240
and it is an unfortunate situation

05:34.240 --> 05:37.040
he got like deep in the 70s because I understand

05:37.040 --> 05:38.800
if someone was trying to take a child,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.280
it is the worst thing that you can imagine,

05:42.280 --> 05:44.360
it's also so bizarre, I mean,

05:44.360 --> 05:48.960
it's the, here and see, the, you know,

05:48.960 --> 05:51.800
I mean, there's certain situation that you can like,

05:51.800 --> 05:54.240
well, you know, that brings that,

05:54.240 --> 05:56.280
that will bring that consequence,

05:56.280 --> 06:00.120
but that's not the case, you know, I mean,

06:01.880 --> 06:04.560
there's certain terrain, you know,

06:04.560 --> 06:09.360
you can put in terrain that the certain kind of seeds

06:09.440 --> 06:11.400
that bring certain kind of plants,

06:11.400 --> 06:15.160
and that's just not the case here,

06:15.160 --> 06:17.920
there's no reason for that, and so,

06:20.200 --> 06:21.880
it's very baffling, you know.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.920
And so, yeah, I know, I know.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.640
And I think, I mean, the best thing I can say is,

06:27.640 --> 06:30.680
I know it sounds, you know, of course you wanna relax,

06:30.680 --> 06:33.960
but the deep breaths when things get stressful

06:33.960 --> 06:35.040
and things will work out,

06:35.040 --> 06:37.160
will help you guys as best we can.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.000
Right.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.600
What I told Val is,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.080
I know you guys fired your last attorney

06:41.080 --> 06:42.840
because something was weird with that guy,

06:42.840 --> 06:47.640
but hopefully, you're able to find a good attorney,

06:47.640 --> 06:50.560
I'm gonna do some work to see if I can help

06:50.560 --> 06:52.400
and find a good attorney,

06:52.400 --> 06:53.240
I'll just give you, you know,

06:53.240 --> 06:54.320
I'll just give you a recommendation,

06:54.320 --> 06:56.320
but yeah, of course.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.960
And then, but once you get a good attorney,

06:59.960 --> 07:04.000
I think you guys will be in a better spot, so, anyway.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.200
Hey, hey guys, sorry, hey, the other half of the cannoli.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.400
I came in the room just now.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.440
I'm eating your cannoli.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.440
I was gonna save you a cannoli, David,

07:12.440 --> 07:13.440
but I'm gonna eat it now.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.760
Well, I think he might miss the flight.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.600
Oh, really?

07:15.600 --> 07:16.440
He might miss the flight?

07:16.440 --> 07:17.280
Oh, dude, come over.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.960
You should really miss the flight.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.360
You might have half a cannoli.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.960
Oh, trust me.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.040
I would love to come over

07:24.040 --> 07:26.760
because eating your deliciously,

07:26.760 --> 07:29.120
you know, home cooked food is better than my carton meal,

07:29.120 --> 07:30.080
which is nothing.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.040
She's good, dude.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
She's so good.

07:32.040 --> 07:36.120
So, I would say I would love to eat with you guys.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.640
I absolutely would rather eat than jump on a flight

07:39.640 --> 07:41.200
and go hungry the whole night,

07:41.200 --> 07:43.240
but at the same time, I think my daughter

07:43.240 --> 07:45.120
hopefully will appreciate this one day.

07:45.120 --> 07:45.960
That's the-

07:45.960 --> 07:48.280
I mean, kids, you have, David.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.280
You can just put one so far.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.280
Oh, okay, okay.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.120
Oh, cool.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.200
Yeah, well, see how you go?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.920
If the plane is not there,

07:54.920 --> 07:57.400
you can't do anything about it.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.240
Yeah, just come over.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.840
You can crash upstairs to have an extra bedroom.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.880
You have many skills,

08:03.880 --> 08:06.000
but you can't-

08:06.000 --> 08:08.440
Tell me, you can crash upstairs too.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.280
That's of course not.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.120
You can crash upstairs.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.280
Yes, and we have space.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.560
This is a big place.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.400
Yeah, you can crash upstairs.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.400
There's lots of space.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.240
Yeah, yeah.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.080
You're-

08:16.080 --> 08:17.360
Hey, if something comes up,

08:17.360 --> 08:18.760
I will give you guys a call

08:18.760 --> 08:20.040
and they'll take it over over

08:20.040 --> 08:21.120
and then we'll have a meal.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.600
But right now, hopefully,

08:23.600 --> 08:24.440
I'll be able to get there

08:24.440 --> 08:25.840
and be able to be funny and close.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.040
Okay, see how you go?

08:27.040 --> 08:27.960
Let us know.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.920
Either way, this house is yours,

08:30.920 --> 08:32.400
and voilà.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.360
That would be cool.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.360
Okay.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.360
Thank you.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.360
Thanks, David.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
Let us know.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
Bon courage.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.360
Merci.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
Okay.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.360
I'll talk to you guys later.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.360
Hopefully, you guys have a good night, okay?

08:45.360 --> 08:46.360
Okay.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.360
Thank you.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.360
Goodnight.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.360
Bye.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.360
Bye.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.360
Thank you.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.360
Bye.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.360
He's a really nice guy.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.360
He's like, you know,

08:56.360 --> 08:59.360
I just want to tell you if Val does something,

08:59.360 --> 09:01.360
he won't be able to tell you.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.360
So, you can't ask him.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.360
That's great.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.360
Because he's like,

09:07.360 --> 09:09.360
because we don't want you to be compromised.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.360
Yeah, but what's going to happen to me?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.360
She's going to think about fucking some people.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.360
Like, you know,

09:15.360 --> 09:17.360
let me talk to her.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.360
That's part of the job.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.360
And look, we know Val,

09:21.360 --> 09:22.360
this is not what you want,

09:22.360 --> 09:23.360
but he will be part of it.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.360
Just don't tell her.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.360
The Casanova spy?

09:26.360 --> 09:27.360
Yes.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.360
That's the title.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.360
The Casanova spy.
