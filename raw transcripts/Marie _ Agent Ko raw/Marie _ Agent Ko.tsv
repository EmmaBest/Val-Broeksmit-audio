0	3440	So, she had a very, yeah, very small recital.
3440	6120	It's a big deal for her.
6120	7200	Of course it is, I know.
7200	9840	And she understands that when work comes up, I have to go.
9840	12560	But, you know, at the very least, what I should do,
12560	14520	like, you know, I should please go back.
14520	17560	And, you know, I got her a little something from L.A.
18560	20560	Oh, that's so cute.
20560	22480	I can catch her before she goes back to sleep.
22480	23760	But that's why I can't tell.
23760	25960	You know, I would love to come right now.
25960	28320	I'm seriously trying to catch her to the airport myself,
28320	29880	which I don't know if I'll make the flight,
29880	32720	but I at least want to make the effort to see if I can.
32720	33560	Okay, I see.
33560	35200	Well, if you don't,
35200	36800	you actually, once you're at the airport,
36800	39480	you're not too far from where we are.
39480	41760	Come here, like seriously.
41760	42600	Just come.
42600	43840	Oh, no, I appreciate that.
43840	46320	And then we're gonna have to, like, don't,
46320	50200	I mean, if you want, not, obviously if you want.
50200	54440	But yeah, there is actually traffic, traffic is back.
54440	59440	So, I don't know how long you've allowed yourself.
60120	62840	It's gonna be very close, unfortunately.
62840	63800	Well, okay.
63800	66400	Well, you know, you have a plan B.
66400	67960	It's easier, so.
69160	70880	At worst, I'll give you a call.
70880	72560	I'll tell you I'm stopping by, but.
72560	73520	No, seriously.
73520	75160	Yeah, do that.
75160	76080	You might not make it.
76080	78560	Sounds like you might not make it.
78560	81160	You know, right now I am sitting in a good bit of traffic
81160	83960	on the 405, so it may take a little while.
83960	87080	But I also wanted to tell you just about,
87080	89000	so we had a very good conversation with Val
89080	91560	and, you know, we got to learn some things
91560	92880	and he got to learn some things from us.
92880	95920	So, the other thing I also wanted to tell you,
95920	99160	which I told you on Sunday as well, you and Val,
99160	101520	is that there are some things that he may not be able
101520	102600	to tell you directly about.
102600	105520	I know you guys have a very open and honest relationship,
105520	106360	which is perfect.
106360	109880	I would want nothing less from both of you.
109880	113520	But there's some things that he's gonna talk to about us,
113520	116960	you know, with us and the things that he's interested in,
117960	119360	that you would not share with me.
119360	120920	Yeah, yeah, no, I understand.
120920	123360	Yeah, and that's just for everyone's protection.
123360	125520	That's mainly for you because if you know about it,
125520	129000	then you could become a witness and I don't want that.
129000	131200	You know, it's really, it's no danger to me
131200	132840	because it doesn't really affect me much,
132840	135000	but it's more like if you know about it too,
135000	138240	then if it's something that has to be testified, you know,
138240	140680	then when they ask, does anyone else know about it?
140680	142360	I think there's, oh yeah, I felt like, you know,
142360	144360	like, is it your girlfriend or is it wife?
145360	149760	Yes, I'm currently in this divorce proceeding, so.
149760	151080	Of course, yeah.
151080	151920	Yeah.
151920	155200	So anyway, so you know, I talk to my girlfriend
155200	158280	and then they say, okay, well, we need to subpoena her.
158280	160960	And then you have to be on the witness ban too
160960	164440	to answer questions, to validate some things.
164440	166880	And that's not good, that's not good for anyone.
166880	171000	Because your identity is out there and anyway, so.
171000	173480	I know, you can, oh, okay, no, no,
173480	175880	you can trust in me, I won't ask questions
175880	177360	and whatever he tells me, he tells me,
177360	180120	I won't torture him for that.
181000	182360	Of course, of course.
182360	183200	Okay.
183200	185360	And you have my number too, it's like,
185360	188200	what I was telling Val is that if you independently,
188200	190800	like say Val is out or something like that,
190800	193200	and you know, you think he says, oh hey,
193200	195080	I'm gonna go work with David,
195080	196720	you can call me at the, hey, you know,
196720	199080	is he okay, is he all right, and I'll tell you, of course,
199080	200800	like yeah, he's fine, he's safe.
200800	202720	And then if we decide to work together,
202720	206920	right now, I have to find something for him to do,
206920	209600	but it's nothing that I would directly
209600	211360	be working with him on, so.
211360	212200	Okay.
212200	214200	Anyway, we'll be on the witness ban.
214200	217600	He's a very talented man, he's got many talents.
218880	221520	Yes, I agree, I hear he's got a lot of talent
221520	222400	and lots of skills.
222400	227400	Yes, he's got a set, a wide range of skills.
228400	230480	Yeah, I know he's got a lot of talent.
230480	232080	As you do too, I'm sure.
233760	236560	No, not me, I've got a very limited number of skills
236560	238520	and unfortunately, I need help,
238520	241440	I need help from everyone to do the things we do,
241440	244960	so I appreciate Val's help going in to help us out,
244960	248720	so hopefully we can find him something to work on.
248720	251120	Right now, I'm gonna have to go back and ask some people
251120	255640	and see what they say and see if anyone has any interest.
255640	257600	And I told Val, and like I'm telling you,
257600	259520	I can't promise that we'll have anything
259520	262080	for him to work on, but he has my number too,
262080	264160	so maybe something else comes up and says,
264160	267080	hey, I've got some good information on this or that,
267080	269560	okay, and then we try to find a good home for it,
269560	273440	but up until then, it's kind of up in the air
273440	275680	unfortunately, so we'll see how things go.
275680	280680	Okay, and you're happy with your trip and your research
280880	282480	and what you wanted to achieve?
283480	286000	Yeah, yeah, I mean, my job today
286000	288200	was just to see what Val's skills were,
288200	289920	like you said, he's a very talented person,
289920	292760	he has a lot of good friends, a lot of good access,
292760	295960	so those are the things that my job is just to go and see,
295960	299520	and then I go up and write a report and I tell everyone,
299520	303240	okay, well maybe he can help on that or maybe he can help
303240	307360	on that, but like I said, I don't have anything personally
307360	311520	that I would work with him on because that's not my thing,
311640	314120	so anyway, that's my main job,
314120	317080	it's just to test and see how things go
317080	318920	and then they work out great,
318920	321040	and if not, you know, we still keep the line open
321040	324000	and you can always call him saying he's got more access
324000	326680	or he's got something else and we're good to go,
326680	329400	but yeah, and we need to talk about Marl,
329400	332480	I'm sure Val will tell you all the details about it,
332480	334240	and it is an unfortunate situation
334240	337040	he got like deep in the 70s because I understand
337040	338800	if someone was trying to take a child,
338800	341280	it is the worst thing that you can imagine,
342280	344360	it's also so bizarre, I mean,
344360	348960	it's the, here and see, the, you know,
348960	351800	I mean, there's certain situation that you can like,
351800	354240	well, you know, that brings that,
354240	356280	that will bring that consequence,
356280	360120	but that's not the case, you know, I mean,
361880	364560	there's certain terrain, you know,
364560	369360	you can put in terrain that the certain kind of seeds
369440	371400	that bring certain kind of plants,
371400	375160	and that's just not the case here,
375160	377920	there's no reason for that, and so,
380200	381880	it's very baffling, you know.
381880	383920	And so, yeah, I know, I know.
383920	387640	And I think, I mean, the best thing I can say is,
387640	390680	I know it sounds, you know, of course you wanna relax,
390680	393960	but the deep breaths when things get stressful
393960	395040	and things will work out,
395040	397160	will help you guys as best we can.
397160	398000	Right.
398280	399600	What I told Val is,
399600	401080	I know you guys fired your last attorney
401080	402840	because something was weird with that guy,
402840	407640	but hopefully, you're able to find a good attorney,
407640	410560	I'm gonna do some work to see if I can help
410560	412400	and find a good attorney,
412400	413240	I'll just give you, you know,
413240	414320	I'll just give you a recommendation,
414320	416320	but yeah, of course.
418320	419960	And then, but once you get a good attorney,
419960	424000	I think you guys will be in a better spot, so, anyway.
424000	427200	Hey, hey guys, sorry, hey, the other half of the cannoli.
427280	428400	I came in the room just now.
428400	430440	I'm eating your cannoli.
430440	432440	I was gonna save you a cannoli, David,
432440	433440	but I'm gonna eat it now.
433440	434760	Well, I think he might miss the flight.
434760	435600	Oh, really?
435600	436440	He might miss the flight?
436440	437280	Oh, dude, come over.
437280	438960	You should really miss the flight.
438960	440360	You might have half a cannoli.
441360	442960	Oh, trust me.
442960	444040	I would love to come over
444040	446760	because eating your deliciously,
446760	449120	you know, home cooked food is better than my carton meal,
449120	450080	which is nothing.
450080	451040	She's good, dude.
451040	452040	She's so good.
452040	456120	So, I would say I would love to eat with you guys.
456120	459640	I absolutely would rather eat than jump on a flight
459640	461200	and go hungry the whole night,
461200	463240	but at the same time, I think my daughter
463240	465120	hopefully will appreciate this one day.
465120	465960	That's the-
465960	468280	I mean, kids, you have, David.
468280	469280	You can just put one so far.
469280	470280	Oh, okay, okay.
470280	471120	Oh, cool.
472000	473200	Yeah, well, see how you go?
473200	474920	If the plane is not there,
474920	477400	you can't do anything about it.
477400	478240	Yeah, just come over.
478240	481840	You can crash upstairs to have an extra bedroom.
481840	483880	You have many skills,
483880	486000	but you can't-
486000	488440	Tell me, you can crash upstairs too.
488440	489280	That's of course not.
489280	490120	You can crash upstairs.
490120	491280	Yes, and we have space.
491280	492560	This is a big place.
492560	493400	Yeah, you can crash upstairs.
493400	494400	There's lots of space.
494400	495240	Yeah, yeah.
495240	496080	You're-
496080	497360	Hey, if something comes up,
497360	498760	I will give you guys a call
498760	500040	and they'll take it over over
500040	501120	and then we'll have a meal.
501120	503600	But right now, hopefully,
503600	504440	I'll be able to get there
504440	505840	and be able to be funny and close.
505840	507040	Okay, see how you go?
507040	507960	Let us know.
507960	510920	Either way, this house is yours,
510920	512400	and voilà.
513360	514360	That would be cool.
514360	515360	Okay.
515360	516360	Thank you.
516360	517360	Thanks, David.
517360	518360	Let us know.
518360	519360	Bon courage.
519360	520360	Merci.
520360	521360	Okay.
521360	523360	I'll talk to you guys later.
523360	525360	Hopefully, you guys have a good night, okay?
525360	526360	Okay.
526360	527360	Thank you.
527360	528360	Goodnight.
528360	529360	Bye.
529360	530360	Bye.
530360	531360	Thank you.
531360	532360	Bye.
532360	534360	He's a really nice guy.
534360	536360	He's like, you know,
536360	539360	I just want to tell you if Val does something,
539360	541360	he won't be able to tell you.
541360	543360	So, you can't ask him.
543360	545360	That's great.
545360	547360	Because he's like,
547360	549360	because we don't want you to be compromised.
549360	551360	Yeah, but what's going to happen to me?
551360	553360	She's going to think about fucking some people.
553360	555360	Like, you know,
555360	557360	let me talk to her.
557360	559360	That's part of the job.
559360	561360	And look, we know Val,
561360	562360	this is not what you want,
562360	563360	but he will be part of it.
563360	564360	Just don't tell her.
564360	566360	The Casanova spy?
566360	567360	Yes.
567360	569360	That's the title.
569360	570360	The Casanova spy.
