1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,260
I mean, I think if, I mean, I know my faults, which are many, and I think that if I were speaking to someone on the record, a journalist, and he wrote about them, I mean, I think it's about being self-aware.

2
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:32,600
Does he not recognize any of the qualities that were written about him? There are many good qualities written about him in that article, and there are many good qualities written about him in the book as well.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, I mean, in the article, there's one of 3,500 words. There's one adjective that is somehow positive. It's fearless. Every other adjective is negative.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean, it's a story about how do you think it should have been written?

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:12,300
Well, I just think, I mean, I just think, I guess, especially because of the journal, the New York Times, I mean, I was thinking that there would be more, it would be more neutral and more balanced.

6
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,700
It's a very one-sided, right.

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:33,380
But it's very unbalanced. It's not like, well, this guy obviously has some flaws, but he's also, it's like, I mean, he even wrote, like, he couldn't wait for his father to be dead and use his document to become famous.

8
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,860
I mean, come on, he knows that's not true.

9
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,360
No, and I don't think that's, that's not explicitly said in the article.

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:54,060
Yeah, I mean, you can read it. It's pretty, well, you know, his father died and it's not long, not long after he was ready to become famous along the way using his, his, his document.

11
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,380
That was his plan.

12
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,480
When it wasn't, I mean, he, they didn't even know he didn't think he would fucking survive them.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:09,920
So, it's like, it's just weird. It's just a weird approach and, um, uh, you know, stigmatization.

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
That's how it feels.

15
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,480
This guy, this, like...

16
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,480
I wish I could say something to make you feel better. I don't...

17
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:33,240
I mean, that's, uh, it's just because I also, I get people coming to me, asking me if I'm safe and, you know, with a guy that is, uh, very unwell, borderline crazy.

18
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,760
I mean, do you think he is unwell?

19
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:46,620
No, I mean, I think he's, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, very sad, but I don't think he's, uh, the person he, uh, David described, no.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,980
I wouldn't be with him.

21
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,600
Sad.

22
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:58,920
Anyway.

23
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:11,300
I'm sorry, I don't think, I mean, I don't think I can help you. I don't, I don't know what to say.

24
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,040
Hmm. I understand.

25
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,680
I appreciate what you're saying and I, I'm sorry you feel that way.

26
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,400
No.

27
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,740
I'm sorry Val feels that way.

28
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,180
Okay.

29
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,200
No, but thank you for talking to me.

30
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,220
Yeah, anytime. Seriously.

31
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,220
Okay. Thank you.

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,180
Okay.

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,460
Have a good night. Bye.

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,140
She's just, she's just.
