0	22260	I mean, I think if, I mean, I know my faults, which are many, and I think that if I were speaking to someone on the record, a journalist, and he wrote about them, I mean, I think it's about being self-aware.
22260	32600	Does he not recognize any of the qualities that were written about him? There are many good qualities written about him in that article, and there are many good qualities written about him in the book as well.
33120	46000	Well, I mean, in the article, there's one of 3,500 words. There's one adjective that is somehow positive. It's fearless. Every other adjective is negative.
46000	54000	I mean, it's a story about how do you think it should have been written?
54000	72300	Well, I just think, I mean, I just think, I guess, especially because of the journal, the New York Times, I mean, I was thinking that there would be more, it would be more neutral and more balanced.
72300	75700	It's a very one-sided, right.
77500	93380	But it's very unbalanced. It's not like, well, this guy obviously has some flaws, but he's also, it's like, I mean, he even wrote, like, he couldn't wait for his father to be dead and use his document to become famous.
93980	95860	I mean, come on, he knows that's not true.
97060	100360	No, and I don't think that's, that's not explicitly said in the article.
100360	114060	Yeah, I mean, you can read it. It's pretty, well, you know, his father died and it's not long, not long after he was ready to become famous along the way using his, his, his document.
114380	115380	That was his plan.
116360	120480	When it wasn't, I mean, he, they didn't even know he didn't think he would fucking survive them.
120480	129920	So, it's like, it's just weird. It's just a weird approach and, um, uh, you know, stigmatization.
131120	132120	That's how it feels.
134060	135480	This guy, this, like...
135480	140480	I wish I could say something to make you feel better. I don't...
140480	153240	I mean, that's, uh, it's just because I also, I get people coming to me, asking me if I'm safe and, you know, with a guy that is, uh, very unwell, borderline crazy.
155640	157760	I mean, do you think he is unwell?
157760	166620	No, I mean, I think he's, uh, he's, uh, he's, uh, very sad, but I don't think he's, uh, the person he, uh, David described, no.
167000	167980	I wouldn't be with him.
174200	174600	Sad.
178600	178920	Anyway.
178920	191300	I'm sorry, I don't think, I mean, I don't think I can help you. I don't, I don't know what to say.
191660	193040	Hmm. I understand.
193200	196680	I appreciate what you're saying and I, I'm sorry you feel that way.
198080	198400	No.
198520	199740	I'm sorry Val feels that way.
199900	200180	Okay.
201420	203200	No, but thank you for talking to me.
204620	206220	Yeah, anytime. Seriously.
206840	208220	Okay. Thank you.
208920	209180	Okay.
209480	210460	Have a good night. Bye.
212960	214140	She's just, she's just.
