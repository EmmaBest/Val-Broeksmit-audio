0	6120	Do not accept. Hello? Hello? Hello?
6860	8860	Is this, uh, hello Val?
9180	14240	Hey, Kaiser Sose. How you doing? One of my favorite characters of all time.
15160	15440	Sorry?
16180	16980	Are you okay?
17480	22080	Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. How are you? How you doing with the whole virus thing?
22080	31240	You know, that, well, Bermuda is not exactly, uh, the tough place to...
31240	32760	That's right.
33680	39640	So, I mean, no, I've, I've, I'm stationed here for a year. It's just kind of coincidence. I'm out of New York.
40360	40820	Oh, okay.
41920	49200	We do have an office here. And an office that was designed for two people is now seven.
49920	50180	Huh.
50180	59560	Because, uh, when, when it started hitting Europe, uh, I have two colleagues in the organization.
61040	63800	They, they, they're from Lugano in Switzerland.
64000	66220	Oh, I know Lugano. Sure. UBS.
66700	67380	Where, uh, Syria.
68100	74040	Just an hour, just an hour, just an hour above, uh, Milano's. I mean, no, they were in harm's way.
74280	74720	Oh, wow.
74720	84360	Um, they came over. And then two, uh, from Finsbury, uh, in London, where we have our office.
85100	85500	Oh, yeah.
85560	94440	Uh, also came here. So, it's, it's now, the club is, uh, you know, the office is, whatever.
94940	96300	It's, it's okay.
96300	101260	But, uh, I, I wanted to give you, uh, some context for this.
101420	101740	Sure.
102620	102980	Uh.
103080	106600	Hold on. I just, you caught me really quick. Can I just grab a piece of paper so I can take some notes?
108280	109000	Hold on one sec.
109000	119420	Yeah, hold on. Um, I got a pen. I got a pen and paper. Ah, okay. And paper, paper, paper.
120860	128640	Um, paper. Oh, I got it. Okay. Okay. I gotcha. I'm back. Paper and pen. All right.
130100	131380	So, I'll just put Kaiser Schoen there.
131380	142600	Um, uh, he, well, I work, uh, we are a, um, we're a merchant bank.
142960	143760	Sure. Okay.
143900	152600	Based in, based in Lugano, as it were. Uh, not Stooky. And, uh, I think, uh, we are the,
152900	160500	I think we are the oldest, technically we're the oldest, uh, funder funds in the world.
160500	161460	Sorry, the oldest what?
161840	168260	How about that? We, we have a family office, we have a merchant bank, and we have a fund
168260	169020	of funds.
169160	172480	A fund of funds. Wow. And the oldest. I see. Okay.
173140	180320	Well, it's, it's a, it's a lot, um, in essence, but, uh, you know, it's, it's, we, we've been
180320	180960	around forever.
181640	181880	Huh.
182280	188860	And, uh, so, but is it, but is it, is it family office not a, uh, sort of a downgraded hedge
188860	189680	fund usually?
190500	192880	Excuse me?
193040	196460	Uh, there's a family office. Isn't that kind of a down, downgraded hedge, hedge fund?
198540	199580	It kind of is, yeah.
199580	200580	It is, right. Okay.
200640	206720	It's like we, we manage proprietary accounts for five families. We have some other outside
206720	218640	capital, and we have our partner capital. Um, so, we've been around forever, and once
218640	220840	a part-time, I worked at Drexel.
221280	223880	Ah, Drexel. They have quite a history.
225600	233860	Yeah. Yeah. So, I was, uh, on the desk, as it were, and, um, in essence, you know, when
233860	243560	that broke out and blew up, uh, some of us from the high-yield world went to, uh, SG Warburg,
243560	249860	and then that small group that I was in, we all went off to Not Skooky, where we've been
249860	256100	ever since. And there was another group that went to DLJ, Donaldson, Lufkin, Genret, which
256100	259140	is since, uh, in the past. Anyways.
259340	260300	Okay. I don't know.
260340	267920	If you roll it, if you roll it forward into the early 2000s.
268780	269260	Okay.
269940	273980	Actually, not even that, the late 90s. Let's call it the late 90s.
274060	274320	Okay.
275600	283380	Um, in the late 90s, uh, a guy named Michael Phillip.
284040	284920	Michael Phillip?
284920	285840	Michael Phillip.
286100	286860	Phillip, got it.
286980	289420	Michael Phillip was hired by Deutsche Bank.
289700	290140	Okay.
290920	293960	To build a North American business.
295200	295800	Okay.
296400	301880	Michael Phillip was the guy that, he was the guy that hired Frank Quattro, that banking group
301880	306600	from, um, from, uh, Morgan Stanley.
306900	309980	They came over and made quite a splash.
310280	314240	But, among other things, uh, they geared up on the fixed income side.
314240	322880	And most of the fixed income new hires they made were the former Drexel guys, who were
322880	331720	the former DLJ guys, who came to Beijing and some of them, uh, in New York at the 60th wall, which is where D.P.
331720	332720	America's is.
332720	333220	Sure.
333660	334520	That's where my father was.
334520	335060	That's where J.P.
335060	335720	Morgan was.
335720	336360	Yeah.
336360	337360	That's where my father was.
337360	338300	That's where J.P.
338300	339800	Morgan, yep, J.P.
339800	340580	Morgan was there.
340580	340880	Yeah.
340880	346840	And the balance of them went to Finsbury, a petty corner from us, which was in London.
346840	355680	There was a large group of credit default swap traders, CLO traders, credit loan traders, etc.
355680	359360	And Finsbury, what's in Finsbury, though, exactly?
359360	361680	It's, that's where your, that's where the other...
361680	367060	Yeah, no, Finsbury's just, uh, Finsbury's the city of London.
367060	368480	I mean, Finsbury's the street.
368480	369480	Okay, that's where Deutsche Bank is.
369480	371040	A lot of, a lot of the big banks are there.
371040	371800	Oh, yeah, sorry.
371800	372800	Yeah, that's where Deutsche had.
373500	373680	Sorry.
373680	378760	Yeah, I, I think Deutsche is in, Deutsche is currently in, uh, Cannery, Wharf, I believe.
379040	381960	But, you know, Finsbury Lane, the garden pod district.
382080	382880	I gotcha, yeah.
383100	386740	Sorry, I lived there for, I lived there for, I lived there for 10 years and I've already forgotten.
387080	387920	Okay, Finsbury Lane.
388280	389240	Yeah, Warburg's.
389580	393380	Yeah, Warburg's is down there, House of Schroeder, etc.
393380	393580	Oh, man.
395200	396920	House of Schroeder, owned by the, uh...
396920	397940	I grew up in Paddington.
397940	398560	Oh, you did?
398960	399300	Okay.
399500	400380	I lived in Kentish Town.
400760	401920	I grew up in Paddington.
402400	402660	Okay.
402800	406700	I, I grew up in Paddington, Queens Park Rangers, all the way.
407040	407400	Oh, cool.
407420	408220	Imperial College.
408480	412700	So, I mean, I, I, so that's, that's kind of my backwards.
413480	420660	Now, if you run it forward, um, we, we tether through our fund of funds.
420760	423280	We have LP interests, they're not big.
423620	423860	Okay.
423860	427780	But, you know, we have LP interests in some big credit side funds, big hedge funds.
427940	438180	Uh, we have access to balance sheet from the six Uber high net worth families that we manage proprietary capital for.
438180	438840	Okay.
438840	444520	So, I mean, we're, we're not, we're not the guys, but we, we can make references like that.
444760	445020	Sure.
445740	453320	And, um, so, fast forward some more, I'm in New York with Nas Stuckey.
453840	456120	I go back and forth to London quite a bit.
456220	458260	This was in like the early 2010s.
458560	458800	Okay.
458900	460820	So, I knew Fitchin very well.
461020	461440	Oh, you did?
461540	462580	You know, Fitchin is.
462580	463120	Sure, Jorgen.
463400	464040	Yeah, I knew him.
465040	465240	Huh.
465280	466780	Yeah, Jorgen and Fitchin.
467320	470060	Now, Fitchin was a guy that we knew really well.
470300	472280	I mean, it was pints after work kind of thing.
472280	482480	And, you know, it, it, it was, uh, in 2013, late in 2013, where he said, you know, we got
482480	486640	a thing, you know, we got, you know, we got something that, yeah.
486900	487260	Okay.
488100	489640	Uh, Fitchin did, Fitchin did.
489760	489860	Yeah.
490240	490960	Okay, wow.
490960	498960	And he called, he called my colleague, who is like one of his closer friends, uh, in
498960	500440	each other's weddings, that kind of thing.
500700	500980	Okay.
501200	502100	Yeah, just kind of quiet.
502300	503300	Yeah, hey, can we come over?
503620	505340	You know, let's, we got to talk about something.
505580	505820	Right.
506140	512820	And they sat down, and it was, you know, Fitchin, his associate, uh, your dad was there.
513060	513660	He was there.
513980	514880	And one other guy.
515300	515540	Yeah.
515760	517200	And one other guy from DB American.
517700	518120	Wow.
518120	520240	Who was, who, who else was there from DB American?
520960	526840	Fitchin's associate, and one guy who was a syndicate bond trader.
527340	528680	A syndicate bond trader.
528880	529440	Do you remember his name?
529460	530760	Out of London, yeah.
531380	532400	Syndicate bond trader.
532760	535700	Carl, I'm not placing, Carl, I'm not placing it.
535840	537500	It's Carl, not there anymore.
537680	538060	Carl.
538300	544460	Um, you know, just like a 27-year-old guy who, you know, was just fresh out of NPA somewhere.
544860	545180	Interesting.
545180	549580	He was, he was from, they were all from, they were all from London, more or less.
549580	551080	Mm-hmm.
551080	555620	And we were just kind of going through this and saying they wanted to do a CLO, but there
555620	557300	was one issue with indemnity.
557300	564060	And, you know, and they may have signed an NDA saying, okay, so I, by the way, I haven't
564060	564440	spoken.
564560	565220	You've got to help me out.
565300	566200	Can you help me out a little bit here?
566300	568980	So I know, so it's a collateralized loan obligation.
569360	574060	What, how, what is that any different from a CDS or a collateralized debt obligation?
574060	579940	Uh, and then why, and why would you, uh, and why would you buy one?
582200	583360	You wouldn't buy one.
583620	584560	You would buy a tranche.
584700	584920	Right.
584980	589940	You would buy a tranche that had literally hundreds, a hundred or hundreds of loans in
589940	590080	them.
590180	591400	So I thought you, the difference is.
591440	592940	I thought you said you were buying one.
593360	594060	Okay, sorry.
594060	597480	No, the, well, they're trying to do a tranche.
597640	598280	A tranche.
598280	602020	A tranche could mean a hundred different loans packaged into something.
602160	603200	And then it's like a wrapper.
603800	603920	Sure.
604100	604320	I know.
604760	608480	So a CDO would be a wrapper of debentures.
608800	609040	Yep.
609340	611520	A CLO would be a wrapper of loans.
612020	614100	And, but isn't it ultimately the same?
614100	615280	And like, what am I missing?
615360	616360	Is it a percentage rate?
616780	618500	Is it a basis point issue?
619500	619940	What?
620740	621460	They're the same.
621660	623840	They're, they're, they're, they're literally the same thing.
623840	624500	That's what I thought.
624580	624740	Yeah.
624860	624960	Okay.
625100	625980	A pool of debentures.
626320	626500	Yeah.
626680	630400	One is a pool of debentures or bonds.
630680	631280	Pool of bonds.
631560	638160	And the other is a pool, the other is a pool or a syndicate of loans, just loans.
638500	641140	Like debentures would have a securities purchase agreement.
641440	641700	Okay.
641760	643920	It could have multiple different investors.
643920	645360	It'd be 144A.
645940	646680	And they're securitized?
646700	647320	It could be a reg statement.
648520	651140	And those are securitized, bundled, and sold.
651380	651580	I see.
651580	653380	You know, like the, like the movie, you know.
653380	658200	You know, it's, you know, you aggregate all the whale shit and it's supposed to be diversified
658200	658920	and sold to people.
659320	660780	So we've seen this before.
661420	666180	And they, they said they wanted to do a CLO, but there was one instrument.
666540	667580	And they said instrument.
667580	671760	There was one instrument that was done by DBTCA.
671760	675740	And, you know, we're, you know, we're sitting, you know, I'm just saying, well, what the fuck
675740	676580	is DBTCA?
677580	677700	Right.
677700	678900	What does this mean to us?
678960	681720	And like, well, well, that's the high net worth division.
681960	685040	I'm like, we're still like, still not following this, guys.
685040	688960	And they basically said, you know, eyes only.
690820	692040	This, this is what happened.
692320	692500	Okay.
692820	693720	This is what happened.
693720	698180	Um, and this is in the fall of 2013.
698540	703060	This was before a certain guy's running for president.
703480	708580	This is, and in fact, if like, if you had said that meeting, this guy's going to someday
708580	713840	run for president and this could really be all this, you know, you'd be looked at like
713840	716100	you had a, a monkey standing on your shoulder.
716160	716580	I know.
716720	720340	It would have been that kind of weirdness.
720340	725800	Now here it was just like, you know, we're getting the sense, uh, from Juergen that, uh,
725800	729220	you know, they got some, they got a turd that they need to get rid of and they're trying
729220	730200	to figure out how to get rid of them.
730220	731000	And trying to sell it to you.
731000	731160	Okay.
731620	734300	And, and no, they're not trying to sell it.
734320	736260	They're just trying to figure out how to structure this.
736260	737840	Oh, so you're there to structure?
738960	740920	So your role there is to structure.
741640	741720	Okay.
741820	746300	To be clear, to be clear, these guys, this, these were the good guys.
746660	746800	Okay.
746800	749540	And there is such a thing as the good guys at Deutsche and the bad guys.
749760	749880	Yeah.
749880	752880	The good guys were DB Americas.
753240	753500	Okay.
753560	757720	If your business card's a DB Americas, you were part of the broker dealer, part of the prime
757720	758100	broker.
758440	758640	Yeah.
758980	766900	Now, let, let me go through this very slowly because it is complicated, but it's also simple.
767160	767520	Okay.
767680	767960	Okay.
768660	772940	So we get past the, well, what the fuck is a DBTCA?
772940	778660	So we look at it and, and they're telling us, well, here's what happened.
778660	788080	The private bank side of Deutsche or the high net worth group is DBTCA.
788080	790080	It is structured as a trust.
790080	791080	Right.
791080	791560	Yeah.
791560	794620	It's a pooled trust, which, which is not unusual.
794620	796080	We have a pooled trust.
796080	796860	And we're like, oh, okay.
796860	797180	Yeah.
797180	798560	So we have a pooled trust.
798560	798800	Yeah.
798800	799640	No problem.
799640	802720	And the trust made a loan.
802720	803320	Right.
803320	806180	And that's where our heads kind of started spinning.
806320	810260	We're like, what do you mean the trust made a loan?
810380	812420	And they're like, well, let us finish, let us finish.
812540	812760	Yeah.
812760	823480	And they said, once upon a time, we were approached by Deutsche Bank's high net worth group.
825180	837520	And it would be sufficient to say that Deutsche Bank's high net worth group is just strictly a loose confederation of independent contractors.
837520	838520	Right.
838520	841320	There's no corporate structure whatsoever.
841560	843500	I mean, if you produce, you get paid.
843620	847480	If you don't, you can sit there and stare at the wall until you get the memo and leave.
847680	848060	Right.
848200	850020	That's why I had no CRO for something.
850020	858000	And it's one of those places where you can literally be an entrepreneur and do whatever the fuck you want.
858140	859900	And if you produce and get paid, it's fine.
860020	860160	Yeah.
860160	860360	Okay.
860460	866560	So we were approached by a high producer on the HNW side.
866560	883280	And she, what she wanted to do was get a loan for one of her clients so you could make some acquisitions in commercial real estate and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
883840	888220	And, you know, we're all sitting there, like, nodding along, like, this is Donald Trump, isn't it?
888280	889620	Like, well, yeah, yeah, it is.
889620	891580	It's just a Trump organization.
892520	896420	And we're not interrupting them.
896540	898700	And they're just like, and to be clear, we said no.
899480	902180	At TV Americas, we basically didn't just say no.
902260	909700	We said no, capital N, capital O, exclamation mark, exclamation mark, fuck no, fuck no, no, no.
909980	910180	Right.
911140	912720	So in other words, no.
912920	914000	Why was it so bad?
914120	916220	What was it that you refused?
916220	920140	Well, because he had a long history of default.
920280	922100	He was the punchline to every joke in town.
922280	923300	Oh, yeah, well, of course.
923560	927400	But if it's a tranche, what's the exposure?
928800	931420	But, like, we're not done yet.
931520	932640	We're not nearly done yet.
932800	939580	So we're saying, okay, so you didn't do the loan, so why are we here?
939880	941780	And they're like, well, the trust did the loan.
941780	945880	And I said, and I actually spoke up.
946020	950240	I said, you know, you're going to be, what?
950700	954200	It's like, that is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
954740	957860	So do you have, like, any details?
957960	959540	He's like, well, I have the long dots right here.
959880	962820	And I said, so where's the consent agreement?
963400	964560	And he said, there isn't one.
964560	970320	And all four of us on our side of the table just said, what?
972900	973960	What a consent.
974140	977420	Let me describe what I'm talking about here.
977820	982260	Like, let's do, this is very, very important.
983620	985940	I've read every word of what Scott's written.
986160	987000	I've read the book.
987000	993840	This is a distinction that really matters.
995180	996960	It really, really matters.
997320	1001180	Okay, let's, it's an easy story for you to remember, okay?
1001300	1002240	Okay, well, I'm writing it down to you.
1002240	1002840	This is a hypothetical.
1003220	1003460	Okay.
1003740	1005100	This is a hypothetical, okay?
1005340	1005600	Got it.
1005760	1010920	Now, let's suppose that once upon a time you grew up in a certain neighborhood and you have four buddies.
1010920	1012280	It's like the five amigos.
1012540	1014380	You plus four other guys, okay?
1014580	1014720	Okay.
1014720	1019100	And you did good deeds for Mr. and Mrs. Jones.
1019220	1023820	Mr. and Mrs. Jones, in this hypothetical, they're some elderly couple.
1024280	1027220	And without asking, you would carry their groceries in.
1027280	1029140	Without asking, you'd shovel their driveway.
1029320	1030880	Without asking, you'd mow their lawn.
1030980	1034140	Without asking, you'd weed their flower bed.
1034680	1035740	Sounds like punishment.
1037260	1039500	No, because you were the good kids.
1039600	1040640	You were the good kids, right?
1041640	1041800	Yeah.
1041800	1050900	And then suppose 20 years later, you get a call straight out of nowhere saying, Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones have both passed away.
1051000	1051500	And guess what?
1052780	1055320	They left their estate to you and your four buddies.
1055700	1055880	Hmm.
1056420	1056680	Okay.
1056680	1058060	I'm the trustee.
1058060	1059460	I work at the investment manager.
1059640	1062340	I work at this wealth management division of a bank.
1063520	1066300	And it's got $20 million in it.
1066340	1067100	So congratulations.
1067360	1070480	All five of you are now worth $4 million each.
1071020	1072580	I'm the trustee, et cetera.
1072780	1075140	So the kind of phone call you'd like to get.
1075380	1075620	Right.
1075920	1076300	Yeah, of course.
1076300	1092400	Let's also suppose that four years later, straight out of nowhere, you learn that one of your childhood best friends had borrowed a million dollars from the trust.
1092400	1103720	And it used that million dollars to speculatively put down a deposit on a ski resort in Vail, Colorado.
1103980	1104240	Right.
1105700	1106960	Some fancy resort.
1107180	1107680	Oh, I see.
1107680	1110980	And he also got equity in the project.
1111260	1113080	And he also got concessions.
1113560	1118760	And the good news is that loan got paid back.
1119620	1119900	Okay.
1120980	1121500	Okay?
1121760	1121940	Yeah.
1122120	1128400	And then the next thing you hear is that your buddy made five or six million bucks on top of that.
1128540	1128780	Right.
1128900	1131340	So he borrowed a million bucks from the trust.
1132200	1132640	Yep.
1132640	1135980	And he turned it into six or seven million dollars for himself.
1136300	1138580	And the trust got paid back a million dollars.
1138740	1139280	So no big deal.
1139520	1139620	Right.
1141020	1142320	What's the big deal here?
1144880	1145800	You're asking me?
1146380	1150460	Well, that he took the money without consent.
1151820	1153260	He took the money without consent.
1153400	1154240	There was no consent agreement.
1154240	1154540	That's right.
1154940	1155260	That's right.
1155320	1156140	He just did it on his own.
1156140	1165860	And even worse, it was structured as heads he wins, tails he doesn't lose, or tails you all five who you lose.
1165880	1166500	Oh, really?
1166720	1167000	Okay.
1167520	1176300	So if this one million dollar loan had gone kaputski, at some point the trustee would have had to call the other four of you back and say,
1176300	1180120	I got some bad news for you, and I'm sorry about this, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1180960	1182640	You know, you're all down money.
1182760	1183960	You're all down 200 grand.
1184120	1184280	Right.
1184280	1193160	So in other words, even worse than the fact that they made the loan at all, even worse than the fact that they made the loan without your consent,
1193800	1196960	they placed you at a material risk.
1197300	1197600	Right.
1197760	1199080	You're accountable now.
1200300	1201380	You're accountable now.
1201380	1201480	Yeah.
1201480	1208760	So just consider that to be the story as to why you don't make loans from a trust.
1209340	1209700	Okay.
1209700	1224020	If one of our clients called us up and said, well, there's this acquisition I'd like to make, and I'd like to borrow $200 million, we'd say, all right, here, let's go get a meeting with the Bank of America or the Wells Fargo or the this.
1224020	1225160	I'd say, we're not a bank.
1225160	1226260	We're a private bank.
1226400	1227660	There's a difference, right?
1227980	1228400	Right, right, right.
1228620	1229820	There's a big difference.
1230040	1236220	You know, we don't loan money out to people that cross-contaminate the other clients.
1236900	1239800	That's not something anyone should ever do.
1239800	1242640	Oh, so cross-contaminate the loans, okay.
1243440	1258400	And here in this meeting, in London, we're being told by DB Americas, four guys at DB Americas, not four bozos, but four senior guys, this is what happened, okay?
1258740	1259060	Okay.
1259600	1261100	There is no consent agreement.
1261100	1275740	The other people in the trust, there are 8,000 clients in the DBTCA trust, 8,000 high-net-worth clients that have anywhere from $10 or $20 million, whatever the minimum is, up to hundreds of millions of dollars.
1276860	1277340	Okay.
1277340	1285440	There is this loan to this clownish developer in New York who has a history of bankruptcies for hundreds of millions of dollars.
1286300	1288280	Oh, and they didn't disclose it to anyone.
1288660	1290160	They didn't disclose it to anyone.
1290360	1292640	So who, man, who drew up these loans?
1293780	1294640	This guy to be Rosemary?
1295220	1299140	So, so, so basically we're looking at this guy.
1299320	1301420	But you're telling me my father's here, right?
1301580	1302740	So that's a big thing.
1302740	1305840	Well, he, he, but he's just listening, okay?
1305920	1310800	It's mostly, it's mostly, it's mostly the other guys talking.
1311020	1311280	Okay.
1311460	1311700	Okay?
1311840	1312060	Okay.
1312860	1314340	It's mostly the other guys talking.
1314540	1318900	So, and basically I'm trying to get to the bottom of it with Juergen.
1319300	1319660	Okay.
1320360	1321640	I'm asking the questions.
1321840	1324460	He's given the answers and his trader is piking in.
1325160	1327500	Those are the only two, these are the only three people who are talking.
1327620	1328820	I was talking to Juergen.
1329040	1329740	And the bond trader?
1329740	1331500	My partner was asking some other question.
1331500	1334220	And the bond trader was adding a lot of clarifiers.
1334540	1340460	So, so basically I just called time out and I said, I slow it down and I say, how in the
1340460	1348700	world did DBTCA loan hundreds of millions of dollars without taking money out of other
1348700	1349520	client accounts?
1349740	1351100	That doesn't make any sense.
1351640	1351760	Right.
1352600	1355080	Said another way, how did this happen?
1355440	1355800	Right.
1355800	1358360	And they said, that's why we asked for this meeting.
1358840	1362380	Well, there is some good news and there's some bad news.
1362600	1363840	The good news is bad news.
1364220	1368320	The good news is these loans have been indemnified.
1368320	1376700	In fact, within two weeks or within two weeks of these loans happening, uh, hundreds of millions
1376700	1381080	of dollars were remitted from, uh, two foreign banks.
1381480	1381880	Remitted?
1381960	1382860	You just said it like that.
1382960	1383400	Two foreign.
1383520	1384380	Two foreign banks.
1384500	1384700	Okay.
1384700	1386220	Well, that's gotta be VTB.
1386360	1387520	Two foreign banks.
1388140	1393140	Two, two foreign banks wired hundreds of millions of dollars into DBTCA.
1394880	1395320	Okay.
1395320	1397060	And I said, well, that doesn't make sense.
1397180	1400720	You mean clients of two banks, two foreign banks, right?
1400880	1401080	Right.
1401220	1401420	Yeah.
1401480	1402740	Clients of two foreign banks.
1402880	1403100	Okay.
1403160	1405580	So it's not really, okay, which banks?
1405580	1407280	And they said the two Russian banks.
1407400	1408220	I'm like, oh, okay.
1408220	1413900	So it would be clients of VB and clients of the other one.
1414240	1414360	Right.
1414500	1414800	That's fair.
1414800	1420640	And they said, a client, and they said, a client of VB and a client of the other one.
1421120	1421460	Oh.
1421560	1422380	And I said, okay.
1423080	1424080	One, a client?
1424320	1425420	A single client.
1425700	1425880	Okay.
1427300	1428180	Single client.
1428380	1428660	Okay.
1428760	1428940	Okay.
1429400	1432360	And I said, well, okay.
1432840	1433220	All right.
1434040	1435260	Let's slow this down.
1435600	1437080	Let's just talk about VB.
1438220	1444320	Now, VB, when you say two foreign banks wired in hundreds of millions of dollars, you mean
1444320	1451960	a client of VB wired in hundreds, and a client of the other bank wired in hundreds.
1452860	1458040	So what did the client of VB do?
1459140	1465200	And they said, well, the client of VB signed basically an indemnity agreement so that they
1465200	1471300	could segregate this money within the trust away from the other principals and investors
1471300	1472080	in the trust.
1472300	1472560	Okay.
1472740	1473800	Can I just ask one question?
1473800	1474300	Oh, kind of like a...
1474300	1474500	Sorry.
1474580	1474760	Sorry.
1474860	1475820	Can I interrupt you for a second?
1475820	1476020	Yeah.
1476160	1480320	I just need to verify an indemnity agreement is just an under...
1480320	1482000	Is this someone that backs up the loan, right?
1482680	1483860	Because I'm thinking a double indemnity.
1483860	1484760	So, okay.
1485080	1485700	It's just a backup.
1485960	1486060	Okay.
1486960	1490920	So basically, I said you have an indemnity agreement for the trust.
1491180	1491920	The trust.
1492080	1492200	Okay.
1492200	1497960	So that they can say with a straight face that they didn't cross-contaminate any client
1497960	1498560	funds.
1499000	1499260	Okay.
1499420	1499680	Okay.
1499840	1500780	Do you have one of those?
1500920	1501820	And they showed it to me.
1501900	1502460	It was ribald.
1502960	1503560	Ribald, yeah.
1503680	1503900	Yeah.
1504000	1504220	Okay.
1504280	1504580	Jeez.
1504960	1505200	Okay.
1505960	1506140	Yeah.
1506140	1509660	And I didn't look at the other one.
1509740	1511220	I said, okay, we get the memo here.
1511420	1511720	All right.
1512740	1523080	And they said, so, do you think that we will be able to say that this loan was made by DBTCA
1523080	1530540	and that it has two indemnity agreements, and we can even say the banks that the indemnity
1530540	1537320	agreements came from, but do you think we can get away with doing a CLO where we describe
1537320	1544940	this loan without saying who the indemnitors are and who the indemnity is?
1545180	1553760	In other words, can we get away with just saying this is one of the loans that goes into
1553760	1562980	the pool, and the indemnity agreement is basically these two banks fortified by a client, and
1562980	1573140	it is client money, cash money, and it is segregated from the trust, and it is to a U.S. corporation.
1573140	1574080	Oh, a U.S. corporation.
1574080	1574280	That's it.
1574380	1575100	Oh, okay, interesting.
1575100	1581440	Like, not even say that it's Trump, and I said, not in a million years.
1581440	1589280	Look at the count, in 2008, like, the one thing the world learned to do after 2008 is
1589280	1594800	if you are looking at a CLO or a CDO, you are going to crawl all the way up the ass, and
1594800	1598440	you're going to look at every single loan, you're going to ask for every single indemnity
1598440	1604880	agreement, you're going to ask for every single segregated pool or SPV or consent agreement
1604880	1611240	or whatever it is, your clients are going to ask you for everything, everything, everything.
1611480	1613400	There's no way this is going to be stopped.
1613820	1614840	No way at all.
1614860	1618280	You're basically being asked to launder money, right?
1618980	1620680	That's kind of a classic money laundering.
1621300	1622580	So let's put this through a corporation.
1622580	1625980	I wouldn't go that far.
1626460	1631760	I mean, it could have been just a loan, and then the loan either gets defaulted on or gets
1631760	1632260	paid back.
1632420	1640860	Now, if there was some kind of a scheme where, you know, these two Russian bank clients, one
1640860	1647640	of them who was Bribovilev, if there had been some pre-arrangement where Trump Org would
1647640	1655400	borrow the money and then knowingly default, and then the lender would knowingly just have
1655400	1656820	a pre-arrangement to write it on.
1657040	1657360	Right.
1658300	1664200	And then it's just a loan, which isn't really income, that got defaulted on.
1664320	1664880	That's it, right.
1664880	1671680	Now, the way money laundering works is, you know, the person that got the loan that defaulted
1671680	1673400	on the loan would pick some of it back.
1673940	1678500	Now, I don't want to get way ahead of myself here and say, I know what I don't know.
1678780	1680060	I mean, I don't know any of that.
1680060	1686880	My point is, once upon a time, DB Americas got stuck.
1688480	1693040	Once upon a time, DBTCA, by way of this Rosemary Clown.
1693040	1698700	But, I mean, they really stuck it to them and said, look, this is going to rot on the
1698700	1703400	books, and it will default, and it will cause all kinds of embarrassment, so why don't you
1703400	1705080	guys take it on the syndicate desk?
1705720	1706520	The syndicate desk?
1706520	1706720	No.
1706980	1707180	Okay.
1707240	1711440	Why don't you guys on the syndicate desk try to put it in a structured product and sell it?
1711560	1711800	Right.
1711900	1714360	And they said, well, we'll look into this.
1714520	1719460	I mean, look, the four guys in the room that they had no intention of trying to sell us
1719460	1719720	something.
1720000	1720620	They did not.
1720820	1721060	Okay.
1721880	1722540	They did not.
1722540	1731900	What they wanted to do was tell us the whole scenario and then hear our reaction.
1732200	1735060	And they all took very copious notes.
1735060	1738760	They all took copious notes, and they listened to every word of our responses.
1739000	1740060	They had listened to our questions.
1740560	1741560	They answered our questions.
1741980	1743020	They asked us questions.
1743180	1744140	We answered the questions.
1744620	1747160	I mean, this meeting went on for about two hours.
1747160	1749720	Lots and lots and lots of notes.
1750340	1752440	The trader had his laptop open.
1752560	1755680	He was typing in his notes the whole time.
1755920	1756060	Yeah.
1756060	1764140	And I think what they were trying to do was document, okay, we did talk to an institutional investor.
1764640	1767880	We talked to Knott Stuky in London.
1767880	1770560	And basically, here was the reaction.
1770560	1772100	Here's the notes to the file.
1773100	1773420	Okay.
1774100	1780240	And the reaction that these guys had, these guys have been around since the 80s.
1780300	1783500	These guys are here for all the crashes and crushes.
1783560	1784620	They've seen it all.
1784840	1786000	And this was their reaction.
1786500	1786740	Right.
1786740	1789120	So, once again, the answer is no.
1789500	1790440	This is crazy.
1790760	1793260	We can't just put this in a CLO or a CDO.
1793860	1798780	And, like, basically, the meeting ended with those guys just saying, hey, thanks for taking a meeting.
1800000	1801380	We really appreciate this.
1801800	1805780	It's important that everyone at DB is on the same page.
1805860	1809080	It's important that everyone understands this.
1809180	1809360	Huh.
1810760	1811240	Okay.
1811560	1811860	Yeah.
1811860	1823040	Because once upon a time, and, like, basically, it sounded to me like they were trying to load up the deck to really stick it to this Rosemary woman at DB2CA and get her fired.
1823440	1823760	Interesting.
1823880	1826100	Because they did a loan.
1826260	1828480	To me, is it possible it was for compliance?
1829000	1833940	Like, they wanted your reaction so they could say we spoke to you guys and they said no as well to the compliance team.
1835360	1837340	You know, as a presentation.
1837340	1837700	I don't think so.
1837700	1844260	I think the whole point of the meeting was to make the point, this is crazy.
1844780	1846720	Nobody gets out of this alive.
1847520	1849420	Nobody gets out of this alive now.
1850300	1857620	And, literally, these loans sit on the books until or if they default or get paid back.
1857960	1859200	And they're probably going to default.
1859200	1867320	And when they default, there's no way, there's no way that we can avoid disclosure.
1867840	1868200	Okay.
1869300	1871420	There's no way that we can avoid disclosure.
1871880	1874700	And then that blows up the whole DB2CA.
1877300	1879140	Look, it amazes me.
1879140	1883520	It amazes me that articles have been written and now a book has been written.
1884320	1892520	And nobody has focused on the fact, the fact, that DB2CA was the one that broke the loan.
1893600	1894040	Right.
1894820	1897000	That is crazy.
1897100	1899720	Hey, you're speaking to the, preaching to the choir here.
1899880	1900260	Thank you.
1900460	1900820	Thank you.
1901120	1901600	Crazy.
1901600	1904460	Now, why is it crazy?
1905140	1916120	Well, ask anyone with a high net worth account at DB2CA if they have a copy of a consent agreement.
1916600	1916880	Okay.
1918000	1919140	It's a real question.
1919380	1920060	It's a real question.
1920260	1920380	Okay.
1920460	1925100	Through all the connections you may have to people at DB, blah, blah, blah, high net worth people,
1925240	1925720	this is a good thing.
1925960	1928600	High net worth clients of DB2CA, step forward.
1928600	1933480	Do any of you have a, what's called a consent agreement?
1933700	1934780	Just a copy of a standard consent.
1934780	1945420	Because once upon a time, DB2CA, by their own admission, loaned hundreds of millions of dollars out of a trust.
1946100	1947900	Now, the trust had $20 billion.
1948640	1948960	Right.
1949200	1950700	But still, that's not the point.
1950940	1952640	We're right back to square one.
1952640	1960480	Okay, what's the big deal about one of your childhood buddies taking a $1 million loan out from a $20 million trust?
1961120	1962320	Oh, and he paid it back.
1962840	1962960	Right.
1963100	1963960	What's the big deal?
1964320	1966000	I'll tell you what the big deal is.
1966660	1969080	You cross-contaminated me.
1969340	1973020	You cross-contaminated your other two buddies, your other three buddies from childhood.
1973020	1984700	In this instance, you're cross-contaminating each and every one of the other clients within their high net worth brokerage group.
1984860	1987340	And if that was disclosed, it was disclosed.
1987560	1988260	It amazes me.
1988260	1989460	They would pull their funds, right?
1990400	1990860	Yes.
1990980	1994200	It amazes me that no one has focused on that.
1994200	2004720	Now, if that is not true, if that is not true, that they are cross-contaminated, then there has to be an indemnity agreement.
2005120	2006820	There has to be an indemnity agreement.
2007300	2008020	And guess what?
2008860	2016440	All of the investors in the trust are entitled to see that indemnity agreement to confirm that they are not cross-contaminated.
2016840	2018060	Every single one in the trust?
2019340	2020420	Every single one of them.
2020500	2020920	Interesting.
2020920	2034740	Ask every single one of them, do you have an indemnity agreement that basically documents that you are not exposed to any material adverse change because DVTCA loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to Donald Trump?
2035120	2035360	Wow.
2035360	2036340	Do you have one of those?
2036680	2037040	Interesting.
2037140	2041020	If you don't have one of those, that's another red flag.
2041960	2042180	Okay?
2042540	2042800	Yeah.
2042800	2050140	That basically says, and then for them to say, well, there is an indemnity agreement, but we can't really talk about that.
2050920	2051380	Oh, really?
2051540	2051800	Okay.
2052300	2052480	Huh.
2052800	2053500	But that's...
2053500	2061980	Which is, sounds to me like, it sounds to me like where we're at now is maybe they have confessed to the indemnity agreements.
2062120	2062940	Maybe they haven't.
2063120	2063420	Mm-hmm.
2063740	2067580	But it doesn't sound to me like anyone is really making demands.
2068260	2068520	Huh.
2068520	2081580	If there is a default, and if it is, quote unquote, no big deal, it's not going to expose any of the other investors in the trust or the other high net worth contributors to the trust.
2082080	2086700	If that is true, who's stopping that out?
2087200	2087760	Who's what?
2088160	2089800	Who's stopping it out?
2089800	2092300	Who is indemnifying it?
2092300	2094320	Now, Scott came very close.
2094480	2095240	Yeah, they're good.
2095320	2098080	Look at the hundreds of millions of dollars that got wired in from Russian banks.
2098300	2098860	Well, you know, that's...
2098860	2099360	Okay, well...
2099360	2100100	Just so I...
2100100	2101020	That all came from me.
2101340	2102480	I gave Scott all that data.
2103200	2104820	Okay, okay, well...
2104820	2105120	I know.
2105460	2106200	It's all...
2106200	2106540	I know.
2106600	2108300	It's all Gazprom, Sparebank, and VTV.
2108480	2108800	And there's...
2108800	2112080	I have the breach report that says it's very clear.
2112080	2112580	Of course you do.
2112820	2113440	Of course you do.
2113440	2116760	And that's an excellent piece of information that confirms...
2116760	2116840	Yeah.
2117020	2118320	Sure, that confirms a lot of this.
2118680	2120260	But my point...
2120260	2123800	My point to you is it's not the bank.
2124440	2124760	Uh-huh.
2125740	2126700	It's not the bank.
2126780	2128200	It's the clients of the bank.
2128440	2134220	Banks don't just wire money to some fucking trust or some fucking bank in the private banking group.
2135120	2136020	Right, that's true.
2136060	2140800	I mean, Gazprom Bank, last I checked, is not a high net worth client of anyone's.
2140840	2141640	No, I know.
2141660	2142800	We're not looking to buy...
2142800	2143560	I mean...
2143560	2144780	Well, neither is Johnson & Johnson.
2145320	2147520	Johnson & Johnson has one billion parked there.
2147860	2149360	You know, it's shady.
2149920	2151280	I mean, I'm going through my father's emails.
2151800	2155220	Why does Johnson & Johnson have a billion dollars parked in DVTCA?
2156620	2157060	Exactly.
2157200	2157420	Right.
2158080	2158480	Exactly.
2158480	2163840	Okay, now, the answer to that question is they wouldn't.
2164300	2164400	Right.
2165220	2172780	The answer to that question in that room in 2013, in the fall of 2013, this is like October, November of 2013,
2172800	2179600	in that room, we all basically nodded in agreement at the end.
2179600	2181260	Yep, that's what it is.
2181320	2181540	Yep.
2182120	2183200	That's what it is.
2183720	2197480	Basically, the capital that got put into DPTCA by Gazprom and by BP is ostensibly nothing but just cash sitting there to indemnify a loan that they don't want to disclose anymore.
2198000	2198480	Yep.
2198480	2200060	And it's not the banks.
2200960	2201480	It is...
2202000	2202840	There's...
2202840	2212420	Basically, that's like you loaning your brother-in-law, if you have one, $100,000 to buy a house.
2212420	2216220	Like, your brother-in-law saw a nice house and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2216220	2216900	My father's done that.
2216900	2217640	He wants $100,000.
2217900	2218560	My father did that.
2218560	2218720	Okay.
2219060	2222020	So, you wire money to your brother-in-law.
2222140	2222360	Yep.
2222680	2223240	$100,000.
2223440	2223560	Yep.
2223560	2227040	And he sees a wire come in from Bank of America.
2227440	2230020	Did Bank of America loan him $100,000?
2230420	2230580	Right.
2230660	2231260	No, of course not.
2231260	2231480	No.
2232040	2232580	You did.
2232760	2232940	Right.
2232960	2234220	That's the way banks work, right?
2234340	2234600	Of course.
2234640	2235400	Banks have clients.
2235520	2235640	Right.
2236380	2237280	Banks don't...
2237280	2239180	Banks aren't high-net-worth clients.
2239600	2245720	Banks aren't private banking clients looking to do a non-revocable trust for their fucking grandkids.
2245800	2246320	So...
2246320	2247020	What are you kidding me?
2247020	2248880	So, why would they put on the balance sheet?
2248940	2252440	Why would they put Gazprom and not the actual client?
2252440	2253300	It's a mistake.
2253480	2254080	Do you think so?
2254100	2254720	It's a mistake.
2254960	2256240	Do you think it was a purposeful mistake?
2257580	2258900	I think it's a mistake.
2259200	2259840	By design?
2259840	2264180	The only reason why anyone knows about that is the breach reports.
2264660	2265920	Is the breach reports?
2266200	2266340	Yeah.
2266700	2268920	The breach reports.
2269060	2272500	The breach reports basically spread the virus, as it were.
2272860	2273040	Yeah.
2273120	2273360	Okay?
2273620	2273780	Yeah.
2273780	2276580	Now, but really focus here.
2276800	2276960	Yeah.
2277520	2280240	As far as DB Americas was concerned,
2280240	2288920	they couldn't disclose to anyone who the indemnidor was without the consent of Rosemary Revol...
2288920	2289800	Whatever her name was.
2289880	2290360	Revolving.
2291160	2292840	Why did they need her consent?
2294060	2295520	Client confidentiality.
2295700	2297040	Client confidentiality.
2297100	2297440	Really?
2297640	2297820	Okay.
2297820	2300300	You can't just run out in the street and say, it's this guy's...
2300300	2301860	But they showed us one of them.
2302160	2303840	They showed us one of the indemnity agreements,
2304280	2305980	and it was not VV Bank.
2306240	2307460	It was their client.
2307800	2309140	It was Rob Althamon.
2309600	2311480	And there was another one.
2311640	2312280	I didn't see...
2312280	2314240	I didn't see the signature on the other one.
2314340	2316300	Did anyone mention Victor Vechteberg?
2316300	2320760	I recall the name, but that's it.
2320940	2321300	That's it.
2321420	2321660	Okay.
2322400	2322800	Interesting.
2323720	2324040	Okay.
2324640	2325040	Wow.
2326280	2327260	That's all I know.
2327780	2328500	That's a lot.
2328540	2330860	That's all I know, but that's a lot, okay?
2331000	2331420	It's huge.
2331500	2331700	Yeah.
2331820	2332280	That's great.
2333020	2333240	Wow.
2333640	2335340	What do you think about going on the record ever?
2337880	2338500	I will.
2338720	2339060	You will?
2339100	2339420	I will.
2339700	2340560	That'd be great, man.
2340580	2340880	I will.
2341020	2341580	That'd be great.
2341580	2342460	I mean, we need you.
2342660	2343260	And this is important.
2343260	2346400	It won't be sometime tomorrow morning.
2347740	2348260	Okay?
2348560	2349300	I got you, yeah.
2349660	2353780	I will be thoughtful to get back to you again.
2353980	2354200	Okay.
2354200	2357520	I've heard from Rocco via this Twitter thing,
2357580	2358620	and I've heard from Sandy.
2359520	2363260	But I would be glad to add the clarifiers,
2363680	2367440	but in two hours, I think I learned a lot.
2368080	2368340	Yeah.
2368340	2373220	And I think I'm just describing to you what it is.
2373260	2374340	What did you think of my father?
2374640	2375500	I mean, he was there, yeah?
2375780	2377800	What was he doing there?
2377840	2380500	I think, to be clear, I didn't know him.
2380660	2380840	Yeah.
2381440	2384680	He was just, as far as I could see, just quiet.
2384820	2385700	He was the best guy.
2385860	2385980	Yeah.
2385980	2386480	He was quiet.
2387800	2389640	And polite.
2389800	2395500	I mean, I can't make more of this than what I told you.
2395780	2397140	I mean, that's what I remember.
2397460	2398720	I knew the other guy.
2398920	2399660	I knew Juergen.
2399780	2400320	You knew Juergen.
2400500	2400680	Okay.
2401360	2401600	Okay.
2401780	2403800	I'm just curious as to just, you know, it's good to hear.
2403920	2407580	Anyone that's met my father, it's always good to hear a story or something.
2407820	2407980	Yeah.
2408040	2412380	I think the one thing that I would add with emphasis is like,
2414120	2416320	at DB, you had good guys and you had bad guys.
2416440	2416580	Yeah.
2416700	2417580	These were the good guys.
2417700	2418760	We met with the good guys.
2418960	2419100	Yeah.
2419100	2424660	The good guys wanted to do something that was, they wanted to do the right thing.
2424900	2425260	They did.
2425460	2425600	Yeah.
2425780	2426460	That's my father.
2426920	2427600	It sounds like him.
2427700	2427940	All right.
2428260	2429020	And he was a good guy.
2429360	2434800	And in essence, it was just, it was just such a hot mess.
2434800	2440560	I mean, no one there, no one there could believe it, that they, they took, they wouldn't take
2440560	2442940	no for an answer and they, they did it within the trust.
2443300	2444540	That was really reckless.
2445760	2446160	Wow.
2446300	2448000	And so it's very crazy.
2448000	2453180	So what do you think if I was going to get a hold of these loans, let's say I had like
2453180	2458100	a magic key that could open up any computer in the world, where computer would I go for?
2467020	2471280	Within DPTCA, there is a general counsel's office.
2471540	2471940	Okay.
2473520	2474180	Mark Stein?
2474720	2475320	Mark Stein?
2476800	2477560	Mark Stein.
2477560	2479040	General counsel, general counsel.
2479260	2479440	Okay.
2479840	2480280	Got it.
2480420	2481360	General counsel's office.
2482600	2483080	Interesting.
2483420	2484880	That's where they would keep the loan.
2484920	2489380	I wouldn't be, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if the original box are in his office.
2490060	2490500	Okay.
2490860	2493040	They would be computerized there as well.
2493920	2494320	Yeah.
2494900	2495660	They'd be scanned there.
2495980	2496680	That's fascinating.
2496980	2497240	Okay.
2498560	2505760	Did you, did you have any interactions with, with like a Michele Faisola by any chance?
2506480	2508280	He's the head of wealth and asset management.
2508280	2513020	I would think that he would be there because he was, he was the head of wealth asset management.
2513800	2513980	Nope.
2514200	2514800	He wasn't there.
2514900	2515460	He was not there.
2515600	2515820	Okay.
2516640	2517220	That's interesting.
2517220	2527260	This was strictly, this was strictly, this was strictly DB Americas trying to figure it out with us and trying to, trying to basically go back with something.
2528260	2532040	And it was all because of this Trump, just because of fucking Trump, huh?
2532040	2540780	And so his loan was so severe, it was such a big, massive breach that it would take down the rest of this Trump and if it defaulted.
2540880	2547260	And what was, I mean, it's interesting that yesterday the news comes out about the loan.
2547260	2549880	And, uh, that couldn't be the same loan, did it?
2552520	2558360	Well, this is some years later, but I have a hard time believing those loans were ever paid back.
2558540	2559140	You don't think so?
2559260	2559720	It's not that way.
2559720	2560200	Okay.
2560700	2561140	Um...
2561140	2562200	Do you know how much we're talking about?
2562220	2567440	Look, I mean, we, we, we don't, we don't know what we don't know.
2567600	2567880	Right.
2567960	2570740	I mean, look, the guy is always broke.
2571240	2571440	Yeah.
2571680	2572280	He's always broke.
2572360	2573460	He's always asking for money.
2573920	2575320	And he's an opportunist.
2575540	2578500	So, of course he's out there asking for money and concessions.
2578660	2581780	I mean, even if he wasn't dead broke, and he probably is.
2581980	2582480	He'd do it anyway.
2582480	2588380	He'd still be trying to rock and, he'd still be trying to rock and roll and get the better of somebody and slip away.
2588380	2592100	And, which is why nobody in their right mind would lend money to him.
2592280	2592500	That's right.
2593160	2593880	Except for...
2593880	2601920	That is exactly why nobody will do business with him, except for apparently this woman at TV, who's no longer there, I understand.
2602020	2602740	Nah, she's gone.
2602740	2603280	Where's my problem?
2603560	2605060	Well, actually, technically she is.
2605120	2612220	They have her employed, because the, uh, we just spoke to one of their lawyers and said that they, she is employed still.
2612560	2613760	Um, on some level.
2614040	2614640	She is.
2614640	2618400	I think that they have her there so she can't talk, is my guess.
2618720	2619880	Um, but Tom Bowers...
2619880	2620860	That makes sense, yeah.
2621000	2623780	Tom Bowers was, uh, her boss.
2624160	2625260	And you heard about him, right?
2625340	2625660	Uh-huh.
2626120	2627880	He killed himself just recently.
2628260	2632880	And, uh, Tom Bowers supposedly has the, uh, these documents as well.
2633880	2634420	I gotta fight...
2634420	2635060	In Malibu, yeah.
2635120	2635780	Yeah, in Malibu.
2635780	2647040	Um, and David Enrich, who I do not like at all, he's much, very much opportunist, and I did not see it coming, and I couldn't believe how, uh, I couldn't believe...
2647040	2651940	I mean, it was, it's unbelievable what he wrote, but the book, he was much kinder than the article to me.
2652040	2656620	And he was good to my father, so that was, that was, that was the best part of it, but...
2656620	2656880	Yeah.
2656880	2662940	Um, Tom Bowers gave David, uh, some loan, uh, loan agreements, loan documents.
2663680	2677800	And the, the, the, the consensus amongst, uh, the Deutsche Bank, I can't remember which lawyer it was, uh, not the head lawyer, it was the, it was some sort of intern type lawyer who said that these were all fraudulent documents.
2678220	2681880	That's his stance, and that's where he's been, the, the word around...
2682500	2683000	Oh.
2683280	2685000	Yeah, he said fraudulent documents.
2685000	2693060	Well, I don't know what that, I don't know what that means, there's all kinds of ways, there's all kinds of things that could be fraud.
2693400	2696500	Well, there's, basically, there's, so, God, what's his name?
2697160	2705400	Uh, some, uh, talk show, a talking head guy, uh, Chris O'Donnell, or something, Lawrence O'Donnell, uh, went on to the news and said,
2705400	2716540	I have these loan documents, um, that shows that, in fact, uh, Trump's loans were, Deutsche Bank loans were, in fact, underwritten by, uh, Russian banks.
2716540	2719760	Uh, and, uh, the next day, he goes on the air.
2719760	2721320	That's not true, that's not true.
2721440	2722180	No, the banks...
2722180	2722940	Were identified, sorry.
2722940	2728200	D-B-T-C-A, D-B-T-C-A wrote the loans, there's no doubt about that.
2728220	2728860	But, I'm sorry, I...
2728860	2730320	Who identified the loans?
2730500	2730880	I've been...
2730880	2731720	Who identified the loans?
2731740	2731860	Yeah.
2731860	2733160	This is, this is very different.
2733360	2734280	You know, I had the wrong language.
2734300	2734860	The identity agreement?
2735140	2735300	Yeah.
2735640	2735840	Yeah.
2736000	2737060	Yeah, sorry, I had the wrong language.
2737160	2742200	I mean, identified the loans, identified the loans, were, uh, Russian oligarchs.
2742200	2751220	He said, he said the word oligarchs on air, and Deutsche Bank called him and said that you cannot, you have to retract this right away, um, the loan documents...
2751220	2752220	Oh, what he said was true.
2752520	2753280	What he said was true.
2753420	2756360	I, I, I, I'm one of maybe a few...
2756360	2759820	I'm one of not very many people in the world who have seen one of those.
2759980	2760740	I know, it's amazing.
2760920	2761480	It's amazing.
2761900	2762180	Um...
2762180	2763320	It's, it is true.
2763460	2763940	It is true.
2764080	2764620	They are lying.
2764820	2765140	It is true.
2765220	2765940	I know they're lying.
2766000	2766740	Those fuckers, man.
2766800	2767320	I knew it.
2767320	2772180	Um, yeah, they're saying everything's fraudulent, and they made him take that, retract,
2772200	2772740	his statements.
2773160	2777820	The lawyer said, if you don't retract that statement, we're coming after you and the network.
2777980	2779400	So he retracted it the next day.
2780000	2781180	He should have invited it.
2781360	2782320	He should have invited it.
2782540	2783220	I know, right?
2783400	2783800	Exactly.
2783940	2784560	That's what I said.
2784580	2785480	That's the problem.
2785800	2789580	That's one of the problems, is, like, you let it rip, and they threaten to sue you.
2789740	2789940	Yeah.
2789940	2790500	Let them.
2790500	2790920	Let them.
2791340	2792140	Discovery's a...
2792140	2792380	Yeah.
2793000	2794080	Discovery's a bitch, right?
2794200	2795300	Discovery's a bitch.
2795300	2798640	And this national spotlight's even more unforgiving.
2799080	2799220	Yep.
2799220	2799280	Yep.
2800400	2800800	Exactly.
2800800	2805180	I don't know why they would blink, but, uh, I, look, I don't know if he saw something
2805180	2812080	or if he was just being told something secondhand, but I saw it in 2013.
2812440	2812620	Yep.
2813580	2818120	I remember, I remember every single detail about that meeting.
2818640	2819580	Every single one.
2819860	2820800	Because it was so terrible.
2820800	2825340	Because, and the reason why that is, is it was just so bizarre.
2825340	2827720	It was really...
2827720	2828580	It was so bizarre.
2829020	2831040	It was something straight out of a movie, almost.
2831080	2833660	It was like, it was weird.
2834440	2836000	It was wildly inappropriate.
2836600	2840240	And, like, to be clear, the D.B. America's guys were not trying to sell us something.
2840380	2844380	They were trying to, like, they were trying to get this figured out with us.
2844640	2848800	And then to go back to the wealth people and tell them why they were so crazy.
2848800	2853260	But so they knew, I mean, my dad would have known right away, and this is ridiculous.
2853320	2854620	He would have known, he did know right away.
2854700	2855260	They all knew right away.
2855260	2861120	So why would the purpose of calling in a third party would be to have on the record
2861120	2864020	that there was a third party that also objects to this, right?
2864020	2868780	They were asked to pitch this, and they came to us and said, hey, we're pitching this.
2869320	2872100	Like, we're not, yeah, we're going through the motions here.
2872240	2872900	Who do you think asked?
2874280	2874720	Huh?
2874820	2876700	Who do you think asked to pitch it to you?
2879100	2880980	I mean, who do you think asked my father's group?
2881420	2887180	We knew all the people at D.B. London very, very well.
2887440	2887780	Okay.
2888040	2888940	Let's just put it that way.
2888940	2895540	I mean, basically, they trusted us to sit down and figure this out with them so that
2895540	2901900	they could go back with a file and say, you wanted us to pitch this to a serious group?
2901980	2902360	We did.
2902640	2902920	Okay.
2903120	2910340	This is a group that could have referred us to these five family offices and these other hedge funds.
2910340	2914800	When you say you wanted us, when you're quoting them, you said, hey, you wanted us to pitch
2914800	2916440	it and we did, who are they talking to?
2916500	2917060	Who's the you?
2917720	2918860	Is that Anshu?
2919580	2920600	Is that...
2920600	2921780	Not Stooky.
2922340	2924400	No, we're not Stooky.
2924580	2925080	No, no, I'm sorry.
2925220	2926400	I'm not explaining myself.
2926580	2930780	Like, who do you think was the party at Deutsche Bank that asked my father and the group
2930780	2932740	that you spoke to to bring this to you?
2934680	2935940	Juergen did that on his own.
2935980	2936980	He did on his own.
2936980	2937260	Okay.
2937260	2946100	He was getting pressure from DBTCA's managing director in charge of blah, blah, blah.
2946900	2949100	They were all just...
2949100	2953220	They were basically a firing squad in a circle over at DBTCA.
2953220	2959360	My father went to DBTCA to clean it up in September, October, 2013.
2959800	2960680	That was his whole...
2960680	2961900	He was retiring.
2962180	2965080	That would have been right after the meeting.
2965680	2966460	Right after?
2966620	2966920	No, no.
2967000	2967820	He was still...
2967820	2968520	October...
2968520	2972940	Because he retired technically September, but he went right to work at DBTCA immediately.
2973080	2973540	So he was...
2973540	2977080	I see the emails from November and October, and he's asking...
2977080	2979600	He's trying to clean everything up, and no one's listening to him.
2979600	2982920	So if you say there's a managing director giving Juergen pressure...
2982920	2983920	When did he...
2983920	2986900	When did he start at DBTCA again?
2987100	2987280	When?
2987440	2988200	Around September.
2988320	2990500	End of September of 2013.
2991460	2992600	Or middle September.
2993000	2993720	This meeting...
2993720	2997920	This meeting would have been either right before...
2997920	2998760	Yeah.
2998900	3000860	He went over, or right after.
3001920	3002220	Okay.
3002320	3003520	It sounds like after.
3003520	3004920	And the guy...
3004920	3005200	No.
3005320	3009520	And the guy at DBTCA, who had pressured this meeting to happen...
3009980	3010160	Yeah.
3010560	3011300	It was not your dad.
3011360	3012000	It was definitely not.
3012000	3012200	It was not your dad.
3012320	3012400	Okay.
3012400	3016320	It was another higher-up guy who was just...
3016320	3017760	Again, another...
3017760	3018340	Oh, the French guy.
3019400	3019720	Okay.
3019820	3020640	The French guy, yeah.
3020640	3020980	Yes.
3021220	3024720	Another can't-take-no-for-an-answer guy.
3025420	3027500	You know, Jean-Philippe or something like that.
3027520	3028140	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3028360	3028920	Yeah, yeah.
3028920	3029180	Okay.
3029340	3030860	And just...
3030860	3031440	And just...
3031440	3033280	They wouldn't let it go.
3033360	3034100	They wouldn't let it go.
3034120	3039580	And they finally figured, you know, this group that we met with, the 4DB Americas guy,
3039600	3043480	said, look, we just need to acquit ourselves of this.
3044020	3044140	Right.
3044140	3044960	So we're gonna...
3044960	3046440	Let's go through this with you once.
3047080	3048320	Let's fill a file up.
3048380	3049400	Ask all your questions.
3050300	3053340	And, like, at the end of the meeting, it was just like, well, that was crazy.
3054620	3057400	Let's go get pints next Wednesday.
3057620	3057780	Right.
3057780	3058800	I mean, that was the thing.
3058940	3060800	We'd go over to the old...
3060800	3062180	Go over to the...
3062180	3066420	Go over to the banger around the corner and have a few pints.
3066680	3067140	And that was it.
3067140	3067580	The banger, yeah.
3067800	3068420	That's great.
3069280	3070040	Man, okay.
3070280	3070880	This is great.
3070960	3071400	Thank you, man.
3071460	3072380	This is fantastic.
3072460	3073140	This is huge.
3074140	3076420	So we gotta do something about this.
3077200	3079780	I mean, I know, of course, you can't go on the record tomorrow.
3080640	3081140	I don't know who to...
3081760	3082500	I know...
3082500	3083100	I'm gonna find out.
3083100	3084040	I'm a month or two...
3084040	3084780	I'm gonna find out.
3084780	3086000	I'm a month or two away from...
3086000	3086180	Yeah?
3086180	3088140	I'm a month or two away from, like, basically...
3089240	3090740	I'm gonna retire at the end of the year.
3090980	3091220	Okay.
3091220	3095440	I mean, I can't embarrass the firm while I'm there.
3095640	3095940	Sure.
3096700	3098200	And just...
3098200	3102240	You know, I'm trying to get an avenue to travel by so I can talk.
3102720	3103180	I understand.
3103880	3104240	But...
3104240	3105480	But I gotta figure that out.
3105880	3108580	But, like, Sandy has been guilting me.
3108880	3111400	Val, you gotta get Trump out of their office now, now.
3111500	3112180	I'm like, come on, Sandy.
3112280	3112720	Give me a break.
3112840	3113460	He's like, come on.
3113480	3114880	There are millions of lives at stake.
3114960	3115340	I'm like, what?
3115840	3116700	He's like, well, with the virus.
3116800	3117820	He's gonna fuck it all up.
3117820	3118760	And people are gonna die.
3119480	3121180	And then I started thinking about that.
3121280	3122540	I was like, fuck, maybe she's right.
3123660	3123960	You know?
3123960	3127820	So I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this.
3127920	3128800	I mean, if we can...
3128800	3133880	And I'm just worried that now, because this virus is taking over the media,
3134060	3135620	no one's gonna even care about Trump's loans.
3136080	3136940	That's what I'm worried about.
3137980	3140060	So maybe it's a timing issue as well.
3140320	3141240	Well, look.
3141440	3141620	Look.
3141980	3144320	Karma has a way of working, eventually.
3144880	3145300	Eventually?
3145400	3145900	I hope so.
3146080	3146640	I mean, come on.
3147060	3147960	Trump's president.
3148100	3148840	How's karma work?
3150200	3150840	Here's...
3150840	3151200	Here...
3151200	3151700	I know.
3151820	3152200	I know.
3152200	3155180	Well, karma took its time this time.
3155420	3156720	But here's my point.
3156880	3157060	Yeah.
3157360	3158540	I think he's...
3158540	3160000	I think he's dead broke.
3160440	3160680	Yeah.
3161440	3162620	Dead broke.
3162860	3163020	Yeah.
3163240	3164200	He's ass up.
3164820	3166260	And now he's gotta go back to them.
3166600	3166940	Yeah.
3167420	3167820	Again.
3168300	3168960	I agree.
3169080	3169620	And guess what?
3169840	3172920	It is impossible for them to do business with him now.
3173380	3173940	Impossible.
3174260	3174500	Yeah.
3174500	3175860	Impossible.
3176240	3183160	I mean, it was close to impossible in 2013, long before this whole shit show.
3183420	3184840	Well, he's just gonna go to Russian banks.
3185580	3186260	I bet you anything.
3187260	3189140	He's gonna go right back to those guys.
3189560	3190260	You know what?
3190440	3191220	But you know what?
3191220	3192220	It's...
3192220	3192580	It's...
3192580	3195640	All I'm saying is that is, like...
3195640	3201340	Back in the day, I mean, he had a lot of eyes on him.
3201480	3203240	He had a lot of people chasing him in the media.
3203760	3203780	Yeah.
3203780	3204000	Yeah.
3204060	3205840	Back in the day, he had a lot of attention.
3206300	3208780	Now he's under the world's biggest microscope.
3209120	3209360	Yeah.
3210020	3212460	And, look, I've met the guy just once.
3212560	3213580	That was in 1990.
3214060	3214300	Okay.
3214300	3217000	He's not a smart guy.
3217160	3217660	I know.
3217780	3218340	He's an idiot.
3218480	3218780	Of course.
3218860	3219380	He's a moron.
3220200	3223120	And his kids are as dumb as the day is long.
3224200	3224800	Oh, my God.
3224800	3226640	And just...
3226640	3232140	Look, at some point, at some point, the jig is up.
3232260	3232460	Yeah.
3232500	3234840	Like, people have to say, I just can't help you.
3235060	3235360	Yeah.
3235560	3236020	That's right.
3237120	3237860	I'm sorry.
3237960	3240160	You'll just have to take your medicine like everybody else.
3240160	3240680	That's right.
3242680	3244160	Hopefully, it's not...
3244160	3246720	You know, what if he's out of office is when the jig is up?
3246760	3251080	We want him out now and to let that happen quick, as fast as possible.
3251720	3252620	You know what?
3253060	3253800	You know what?
3254100	3257640	If the noose tightens enough...
3257640	3257820	Yeah.
3259680	3263440	If the noose tightens enough, he really needs the money that badly.
3263660	3263860	Yeah.
3264340	3265840	Don't be surprised if he just...
3265840	3268480	Don't be surprised if one day just straight out of nowhere he quits.
3268480	3268880	Yeah.
3269140	3269800	Yeah, exactly.
3270220	3271000	That's what I was thinking, too.
3271340	3271820	It could...
3271820	3274980	It's not likely, but it's not an impossibility.
3275140	3280060	And he'll just take whatever he's built up while he's in office to try and make...
3280060	3282300	Just to try and monetize that, of course.
3282980	3286840	And then when everyone turns their back on him, then there'll be something else.
3287040	3287560	I just hope...
3287560	3291560	If that happens while he's in office, that could be very dangerous for everybody in the world.
3292120	3293080	That's what I'm worried about.
3293200	3296480	If people start turning their back on him now, for money-wise, he will act out.
3298080	3298440	Right?
3298540	3298780	Yeah.
3298780	3302580	So, let's let that happen after the presidency.
3302740	3303180	I'll tell you what.
3303300	3306200	I've got to meet someone for a late supper.
3306500	3306780	Okay.
3307260	3309160	And I will...
3309160	3310580	I'll keep the thing open.
3310740	3311640	I'll get a signal.
3311900	3312980	I will get a signal.
3313240	3313480	Okay.
3313480	3314380	I'll let you know, okay?
3314580	3314960	All right, man.
3315000	3316680	Can I get a first name so I don't call you Kaiser?
3316920	3317700	Even though I like Kaiser.
3318800	3319280	That's a good name.
3319300	3320320	No, we can do that.
3320680	3321220	It's Colin.
3321480	3321760	Colin.
3321920	3322340	Okay, Colin.
3322440	3322740	Colin.
3323220	3323800	Thanks, Colin.
3324060	3324280	All right.
3324280	3325780	And please stay in touch, okay?
3327100	3327580	I will.
3327760	3328000	Okay.
3328200	3328560	All right, man.
3328640	3328880	Thanks.
3329300	3329480	Cheers.
3329820	3329940	Bye.
3330100	3330240	Bye.
3332400	3332840	Okay.
3333200	3333860	I wouldn't care.
3334620	3335060	Yeah.
