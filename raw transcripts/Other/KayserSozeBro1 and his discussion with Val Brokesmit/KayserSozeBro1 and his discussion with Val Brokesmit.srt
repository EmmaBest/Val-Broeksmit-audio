1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
Do not accept. Hello? Hello? Hello?

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,860
Is this, uh, hello Val?

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,240
Hey, Kaiser Sose. How you doing? One of my favorite characters of all time.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,440
Sorry?

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,980
Are you okay?

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,080
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. How are you? How you doing with the whole virus thing?

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:31,240
You know, that, well, Bermuda is not exactly, uh, the tough place to...

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,760
That's right.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,640
So, I mean, no, I've, I've, I'm stationed here for a year. It's just kind of coincidence. I'm out of New York.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,820
Oh, okay.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,200
We do have an office here. And an office that was designed for two people is now seven.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,180
Huh.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:59,560
Because, uh, when, when it started hitting Europe, uh, I have two colleagues in the organization.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,800
They, they, they're from Lugano in Switzerland.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,220
Oh, I know Lugano. Sure. UBS.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,380
Where, uh, Syria.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,040
Just an hour, just an hour, just an hour above, uh, Milano's. I mean, no, they were in harm's way.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,720
Oh, wow.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:24,360
Um, they came over. And then two, uh, from Finsbury, uh, in London, where we have our office.

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,500
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:34,440
Uh, also came here. So, it's, it's now, the club is, uh, you know, the office is, whatever.

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,300
It's, it's okay.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,260
But, uh, I, I wanted to give you, uh, some context for this.

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,740
Sure.

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:42,980
Uh.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,600
Hold on. I just, you caught me really quick. Can I just grab a piece of paper so I can take some notes?

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,000
Hold on one sec.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,420
Yeah, hold on. Um, I got a pen. I got a pen and paper. Ah, okay. And paper, paper, paper.

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:08,640
Um, paper. Oh, I got it. Okay. Okay. I gotcha. I'm back. Paper and pen. All right.

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,380
So, I'll just put Kaiser Schoen there.

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:22,600
Um, uh, he, well, I work, uh, we are a, um, we're a merchant bank.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Sure. Okay.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,600
Based in, based in Lugano, as it were. Uh, not Stooky. And, uh, I think, uh, we are the,

34
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:40,500
I think we are the oldest, technically we're the oldest, uh, funder funds in the world.

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,460
Sorry, the oldest what?

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,260
How about that? We, we have a family office, we have a merchant bank, and we have a fund

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,020
of funds.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,480
A fund of funds. Wow. And the oldest. I see. Okay.

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,320
Well, it's, it's a, it's a lot, um, in essence, but, uh, you know, it's, it's, we, we've been

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,960
around forever.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:01,880
Huh.

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,860
And, uh, so, but is it, but is it, is it family office not a, uh, sort of a downgraded hedge

43
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,680
fund usually?

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,880
Excuse me?

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,460
Uh, there's a family office. Isn't that kind of a down, downgraded hedge, hedge fund?

46
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,580
It kind of is, yeah.

47
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,580
It is, right. Okay.

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,720
It's like we, we manage proprietary accounts for five families. We have some other outside

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:38,640
capital, and we have our partner capital. Um, so, we've been around forever, and once

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,840
a part-time, I worked at Drexel.

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,880
Ah, Drexel. They have quite a history.

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:53,860
Yeah. Yeah. So, I was, uh, on the desk, as it were, and, um, in essence, you know, when

53
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:03,560
that broke out and blew up, uh, some of us from the high-yield world went to, uh, SG Warburg,

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,860
and then that small group that I was in, we all went off to Not Skooky, where we've been

55
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,100
ever since. And there was another group that went to DLJ, Donaldson, Lufkin, Genret, which

56
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,140
is since, uh, in the past. Anyways.

57
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,300
Okay. I don't know.

58
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:27,920
If you roll it, if you roll it forward into the early 2000s.

59
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,260
Okay.

60
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,980
Actually, not even that, the late 90s. Let's call it the late 90s.

61
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,320
Okay.

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:43,380
Um, in the late 90s, uh, a guy named Michael Phillip.

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
Michael Phillip?

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,840
Michael Phillip.

65
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,860
Phillip, got it.

66
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,420
Michael Phillip was hired by Deutsche Bank.

67
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,140
Okay.

68
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,960
To build a North American business.

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Okay.

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,880
Michael Phillip was the guy that, he was the guy that hired Frank Quattro, that banking group

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,600
from, um, from, uh, Morgan Stanley.

72
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,980
They came over and made quite a splash.

73
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,240
But, among other things, uh, they geared up on the fixed income side.

74
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,880
And most of the fixed income new hires they made were the former Drexel guys, who were

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:31,720
the former DLJ guys, who came to Beijing and some of them, uh, in New York at the 60th wall, which is where D.P.

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
America's is.

77
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,220
Sure.

78
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,520
That's where my father was.

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,060
That's where J.P.

80
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,720
Morgan was.

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,360
Yeah.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
That's where my father was.

83
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,300
That's where J.P.

84
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,800
Morgan, yep, J.P.

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,580
Morgan was there.

86
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:40,880
Yeah.

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,840
And the balance of them went to Finsbury, a petty corner from us, which was in London.

88
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:55,680
There was a large group of credit default swap traders, CLO traders, credit loan traders, etc.

89
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,360
And Finsbury, what's in Finsbury, though, exactly?

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
It's, that's where your, that's where the other...

91
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,060
Yeah, no, Finsbury's just, uh, Finsbury's the city of London.

92
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,480
I mean, Finsbury's the street.

93
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Okay, that's where Deutsche Bank is.

94
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,040
A lot of, a lot of the big banks are there.

95
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh, yeah, sorry.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Yeah, that's where Deutsche had.

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:13,680
Sorry.

98
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,760
Yeah, I, I think Deutsche is in, Deutsche is currently in, uh, Cannery, Wharf, I believe.

99
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,960
But, you know, Finsbury Lane, the garden pod district.

100
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,880
I gotcha, yeah.

101
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,740
Sorry, I lived there for, I lived there for, I lived there for 10 years and I've already forgotten.

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,920
Okay, Finsbury Lane.

103
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,240
Yeah, Warburg's.

104
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,380
Yeah, Warburg's is down there, House of Schroeder, etc.

105
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,580
Oh, man.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,920
House of Schroeder, owned by the, uh...

107
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,940
I grew up in Paddington.

108
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,560
Oh, you did?

109
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,300
Okay.

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,380
I lived in Kentish Town.

111
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,920
I grew up in Paddington.

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,660
Okay.

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,700
I, I grew up in Paddington, Queens Park Rangers, all the way.

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,400
Oh, cool.

115
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,220
Imperial College.

116
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,700
So, I mean, I, I, so that's, that's kind of my backwards.

117
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,660
Now, if you run it forward, um, we, we tether through our fund of funds.

118
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,280
We have LP interests, they're not big.

119
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:03,860
Okay.

120
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,780
But, you know, we have LP interests in some big credit side funds, big hedge funds.

121
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:18,180
Uh, we have access to balance sheet from the six Uber high net worth families that we manage proprietary capital for.

122
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,840
Okay.

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,520
So, I mean, we're, we're not, we're not the guys, but we, we can make references like that.

124
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,020
Sure.

125
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,320
And, um, so, fast forward some more, I'm in New York with Nas Stuckey.

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,120
I go back and forth to London quite a bit.

127
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,260
This was in like the early 2010s.

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:38,800
Okay.

129
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,820
So, I knew Fitchin very well.

130
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,440
Oh, you did?

131
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,580
You know, Fitchin is.

132
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,120
Sure, Jorgen.

133
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,040
Yeah, I knew him.

134
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,240
Huh.

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,780
Yeah, Jorgen and Fitchin.

136
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,060
Now, Fitchin was a guy that we knew really well.

137
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,280
I mean, it was pints after work kind of thing.

138
00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:02,480
And, you know, it, it, it was, uh, in 2013, late in 2013, where he said, you know, we got

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,640
a thing, you know, we got, you know, we got something that, yeah.

140
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,260
Okay.

141
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,640
Uh, Fitchin did, Fitchin did.

142
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:09,860
Yeah.

143
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,960
Okay, wow.

144
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,960
And he called, he called my colleague, who is like one of his closer friends, uh, in

145
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,440
each other's weddings, that kind of thing.

146
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:20,980
Okay.

147
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,100
Yeah, just kind of quiet.

148
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Yeah, hey, can we come over?

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,340
You know, let's, we got to talk about something.

150
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:25,820
Right.

151
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,820
And they sat down, and it was, you know, Fitchin, his associate, uh, your dad was there.

152
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,660
He was there.

153
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,880
And one other guy.

154
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,540
Yeah.

155
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
And one other guy from DB American.

156
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,120
Wow.

157
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,240
Who was, who, who else was there from DB American?

158
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,840
Fitchin's associate, and one guy who was a syndicate bond trader.

159
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,680
A syndicate bond trader.

160
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,440
Do you remember his name?

161
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,760
Out of London, yeah.

162
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,400
Syndicate bond trader.

163
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,700
Carl, I'm not placing, Carl, I'm not placing it.

164
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,500
It's Carl, not there anymore.

165
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,060
Carl.

166
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,460
Um, you know, just like a 27-year-old guy who, you know, was just fresh out of NPA somewhere.

167
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,180
Interesting.

168
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,580
He was, he was from, they were all from, they were all from London, more or less.

169
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,080
Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,620
And we were just kind of going through this and saying they wanted to do a CLO, but there

171
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,300
was one issue with indemnity.

172
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,060
And, you know, and they may have signed an NDA saying, okay, so I, by the way, I haven't

173
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,440
spoken.

174
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,220
You've got to help me out.

175
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,200
Can you help me out a little bit here?

176
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,980
So I know, so it's a collateralized loan obligation.

177
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,060
What, how, what is that any different from a CDS or a collateralized debt obligation?

178
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,940
Uh, and then why, and why would you, uh, and why would you buy one?

179
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,360
You wouldn't buy one.

180
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,560
You would buy a tranche.

181
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:44,920
Right.

182
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,940
You would buy a tranche that had literally hundreds, a hundred or hundreds of loans in

183
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,080
them.

184
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,400
So I thought you, the difference is.

185
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,940
I thought you said you were buying one.

186
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,060
Okay, sorry.

187
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,480
No, the, well, they're trying to do a tranche.

188
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,280
A tranche.

189
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,020
A tranche could mean a hundred different loans packaged into something.

190
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,200
And then it's like a wrapper.

191
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:03,920
Sure.

192
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,320
I know.

193
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,480
So a CDO would be a wrapper of debentures.

194
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,040
Yep.

195
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,520
A CLO would be a wrapper of loans.

196
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,100
And, but isn't it ultimately the same?

197
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,280
And like, what am I missing?

198
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Is it a percentage rate?

199
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,500
Is it a basis point issue?

200
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,940
What?

201
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,460
They're the same.

202
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,840
They're, they're, they're, they're literally the same thing.

203
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,500
That's what I thought.

204
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:24,740
Yeah.

205
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:24,960
Okay.

206
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,980
A pool of debentures.

207
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,500
Yeah.

208
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,400
One is a pool of debentures or bonds.

209
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,280
Pool of bonds.

210
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,160
And the other is a pool, the other is a pool or a syndicate of loans, just loans.

211
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,140
Like debentures would have a securities purchase agreement.

212
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,700
Okay.

213
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
It could have multiple different investors.

214
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
It'd be 144A.

215
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,680
And they're securitized?

216
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,320
It could be a reg statement.

217
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,140
And those are securitized, bundled, and sold.

218
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,580
I see.

219
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,380
You know, like the, like the movie, you know.

220
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,200
You know, it's, you know, you aggregate all the whale shit and it's supposed to be diversified

221
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,920
and sold to people.

222
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,780
So we've seen this before.

223
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,180
And they, they said they wanted to do a CLO, but there was one instrument.

224
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,580
And they said instrument.

225
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,760
There was one instrument that was done by DBTCA.

226
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,740
And, you know, we're, you know, we're sitting, you know, I'm just saying, well, what the fuck

227
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,580
is DBTCA?

228
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,700
Right.

229
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,900
What does this mean to us?

230
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,720
And like, well, well, that's the high net worth division.

231
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,040
I'm like, we're still like, still not following this, guys.

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,960
And they basically said, you know, eyes only.

233
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,040
This, this is what happened.

234
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,500
Okay.

235
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,720
This is what happened.

236
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,180
Um, and this is in the fall of 2013.

237
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,060
This was before a certain guy's running for president.

238
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,580
This is, and in fact, if like, if you had said that meeting, this guy's going to someday

239
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,840
run for president and this could really be all this, you know, you'd be looked at like

240
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,100
you had a, a monkey standing on your shoulder.

241
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,580
I know.

242
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,340
It would have been that kind of weirdness.

243
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,800
Now here it was just like, you know, we're getting the sense, uh, from Juergen that, uh,

244
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,220
you know, they got some, they got a turd that they need to get rid of and they're trying

245
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,200
to figure out how to get rid of them.

246
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,000
And trying to sell it to you.

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,160
Okay.

248
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,300
And, and no, they're not trying to sell it.

249
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,260
They're just trying to figure out how to structure this.

250
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,840
Oh, so you're there to structure?

251
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,920
So your role there is to structure.

252
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:21,720
Okay.

253
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,300
To be clear, to be clear, these guys, this, these were the good guys.

254
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:26,800
Okay.

255
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,540
And there is such a thing as the good guys at Deutsche and the bad guys.

256
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:29,880
Yeah.

257
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,880
The good guys were DB Americas.

258
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,500
Okay.

259
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,720
If your business card's a DB Americas, you were part of the broker dealer, part of the prime

260
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,100
broker.

261
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,640
Yeah.

262
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:46,900
Now, let, let me go through this very slowly because it is complicated, but it's also simple.

263
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,520
Okay.

264
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:47,960
Okay.

265
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,940
So we get past the, well, what the fuck is a DBTCA?

266
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,660
So we look at it and, and they're telling us, well, here's what happened.

267
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:08,080
The private bank side of Deutsche or the high net worth group is DBTCA.

268
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
It is structured as a trust.

269
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Right.

270
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,560
Yeah.

271
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,620
It's a pooled trust, which, which is not unusual.

272
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,080
We have a pooled trust.

273
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,860
And we're like, oh, okay.

274
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,180
Yeah.

275
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,560
So we have a pooled trust.

276
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:18,800
Yeah.

277
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,640
No problem.

278
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,720
And the trust made a loan.

279
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,320
Right.

280
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,180
And that's where our heads kind of started spinning.

281
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,260
We're like, what do you mean the trust made a loan?

282
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,420
And they're like, well, let us finish, let us finish.

283
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:32,760
Yeah.

284
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:43,480
And they said, once upon a time, we were approached by Deutsche Bank's high net worth group.

285
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:57,520
And it would be sufficient to say that Deutsche Bank's high net worth group is just strictly a loose confederation of independent contractors.

286
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Right.

287
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,320
There's no corporate structure whatsoever.

288
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,500
I mean, if you produce, you get paid.

289
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,480
If you don't, you can sit there and stare at the wall until you get the memo and leave.

290
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,060
Right.

291
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,020
That's why I had no CRO for something.

292
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:18,000
And it's one of those places where you can literally be an entrepreneur and do whatever the fuck you want.

293
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,900
And if you produce and get paid, it's fine.

294
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,160
Yeah.

295
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,360
Okay.

296
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,560
So we were approached by a high producer on the HNW side.

297
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:43,280
And she, what she wanted to do was get a loan for one of her clients so you could make some acquisitions in commercial real estate and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

298
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,220
And, you know, we're all sitting there, like, nodding along, like, this is Donald Trump, isn't it?

299
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,620
Like, well, yeah, yeah, it is.

300
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,580
It's just a Trump organization.

301
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,420
And we're not interrupting them.

302
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,700
And they're just like, and to be clear, we said no.

303
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,180
At TV Americas, we basically didn't just say no.

304
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,700
We said no, capital N, capital O, exclamation mark, exclamation mark, fuck no, fuck no, no, no.

305
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,180
Right.

306
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,720
So in other words, no.

307
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,000
Why was it so bad?

308
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,220
What was it that you refused?

309
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,140
Well, because he had a long history of default.

310
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,100
He was the punchline to every joke in town.

311
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,300
Oh, yeah, well, of course.

312
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,400
But if it's a tranche, what's the exposure?

313
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,420
But, like, we're not done yet.

314
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,640
We're not nearly done yet.

315
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,580
So we're saying, okay, so you didn't do the loan, so why are we here?

316
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,780
And they're like, well, the trust did the loan.

317
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,880
And I said, and I actually spoke up.

318
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,240
I said, you know, you're going to be, what?

319
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,200
It's like, that is the craziest thing I have ever heard.

320
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,860
So do you have, like, any details?

321
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,540
He's like, well, I have the long dots right here.

322
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,820
And I said, so where's the consent agreement?

323
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,560
And he said, there isn't one.

324
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,320
And all four of us on our side of the table just said, what?

325
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,960
What a consent.

326
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,420
Let me describe what I'm talking about here.

327
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,260
Like, let's do, this is very, very important.

328
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,940
I've read every word of what Scott's written.

329
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,000
I've read the book.

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,840
This is a distinction that really matters.

331
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,960
It really, really matters.

332
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,180
Okay, let's, it's an easy story for you to remember, okay?

333
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,240
Okay, well, I'm writing it down to you.

334
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,840
This is a hypothetical.

335
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,460
Okay.

336
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,100
This is a hypothetical, okay?

337
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,600
Got it.

338
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,920
Now, let's suppose that once upon a time you grew up in a certain neighborhood and you have four buddies.

339
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,280
It's like the five amigos.

340
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,380
You plus four other guys, okay?

341
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:54,720
Okay.

342
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,100
And you did good deeds for Mr. and Mrs. Jones.

343
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,820
Mr. and Mrs. Jones, in this hypothetical, they're some elderly couple.

344
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,220
And without asking, you would carry their groceries in.

345
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,140
Without asking, you'd shovel their driveway.

346
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,880
Without asking, you'd mow their lawn.

347
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,140
Without asking, you'd weed their flower bed.

348
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,740
Sounds like punishment.

349
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,500
No, because you were the good kids.

350
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,640
You were the good kids, right?

351
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:21,800
Yeah.

352
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:30,900
And then suppose 20 years later, you get a call straight out of nowhere saying, Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones have both passed away.

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,500
And guess what?

354
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,320
They left their estate to you and your four buddies.

355
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:35,880
Hmm.

356
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,680
Okay.

357
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,060
I'm the trustee.

358
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,460
I work at the investment manager.

359
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,340
I work at this wealth management division of a bank.

360
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,300
And it's got $20 million in it.

361
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,100
So congratulations.

362
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,480
All five of you are now worth $4 million each.

363
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,580
I'm the trustee, et cetera.

364
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,140
So the kind of phone call you'd like to get.

365
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,620
Right.

366
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,300
Yeah, of course.

367
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:12,400
Let's also suppose that four years later, straight out of nowhere, you learn that one of your childhood best friends had borrowed a million dollars from the trust.

368
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:23,720
And it used that million dollars to speculatively put down a deposit on a ski resort in Vail, Colorado.

369
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,240
Right.

370
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,960
Some fancy resort.

371
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,680
Oh, I see.

372
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,980
And he also got equity in the project.

373
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,080
And he also got concessions.

374
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,760
And the good news is that loan got paid back.

375
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:39,900
Okay.

376
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,500
Okay?

377
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah.

378
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,400
And then the next thing you hear is that your buddy made five or six million bucks on top of that.

379
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:48,780
Right.

380
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,340
So he borrowed a million bucks from the trust.

381
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,640
Yep.

382
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,980
And he turned it into six or seven million dollars for himself.

383
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,580
And the trust got paid back a million dollars.

384
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,280
So no big deal.

385
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,620
Right.

386
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,320
What's the big deal here?

387
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,800
You're asking me?

388
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,460
Well, that he took the money without consent.

389
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,260
He took the money without consent.

390
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,240
There was no consent agreement.

391
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,540
That's right.

392
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,260
That's right.

393
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,140
He just did it on his own.

394
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:25,860
And even worse, it was structured as heads he wins, tails he doesn't lose, or tails you all five who you lose.

395
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,500
Oh, really?

396
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay.

397
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:36,300
So if this one million dollar loan had gone kaputski, at some point the trustee would have had to call the other four of you back and say,

398
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,120
I got some bad news for you, and I'm sorry about this, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

399
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,640
You know, you're all down money.

400
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,960
You're all down 200 grand.

401
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,280
Right.

402
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:53,160
So in other words, even worse than the fact that they made the loan at all, even worse than the fact that they made the loan without your consent,

403
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,960
they placed you at a material risk.

404
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,600
Right.

405
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,080
You're accountable now.

406
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,380
You're accountable now.

407
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:01,480
Yeah.

408
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,760
So just consider that to be the story as to why you don't make loans from a trust.

409
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,700
Okay.

410
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:24,020
If one of our clients called us up and said, well, there's this acquisition I'd like to make, and I'd like to borrow $200 million, we'd say, all right, here, let's go get a meeting with the Bank of America or the Wells Fargo or the this.

411
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,160
I'd say, we're not a bank.

412
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,260
We're a private bank.

413
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,660
There's a difference, right?

414
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,400
Right, right, right.

415
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,820
There's a big difference.

416
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,220
You know, we don't loan money out to people that cross-contaminate the other clients.

417
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,800
That's not something anyone should ever do.

418
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,640
Oh, so cross-contaminate the loans, okay.

419
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:58,400
And here in this meeting, in London, we're being told by DB Americas, four guys at DB Americas, not four bozos, but four senior guys, this is what happened, okay?

420
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,060
Okay.

421
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,100
There is no consent agreement.

422
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:15,740
The other people in the trust, there are 8,000 clients in the DBTCA trust, 8,000 high-net-worth clients that have anywhere from $10 or $20 million, whatever the minimum is, up to hundreds of millions of dollars.

423
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,340
Okay.

424
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:25,440
There is this loan to this clownish developer in New York who has a history of bankruptcies for hundreds of millions of dollars.

425
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,280
Oh, and they didn't disclose it to anyone.

426
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,160
They didn't disclose it to anyone.

427
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,640
So who, man, who drew up these loans?

428
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,640
This guy to be Rosemary?

429
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,140
So, so, so basically we're looking at this guy.

430
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,420
But you're telling me my father's here, right?

431
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,740
So that's a big thing.

432
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,840
Well, he, he, but he's just listening, okay?

433
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,800
It's mostly, it's mostly, it's mostly the other guys talking.

434
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,280
Okay.

435
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,700
Okay?

436
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,060
Okay.

437
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,340
It's mostly the other guys talking.

438
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,900
So, and basically I'm trying to get to the bottom of it with Juergen.

439
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,660
Okay.

440
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,640
I'm asking the questions.

441
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,460
He's given the answers and his trader is piking in.

442
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,500
Those are the only two, these are the only three people who are talking.

443
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,820
I was talking to Juergen.

444
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,740
And the bond trader?

445
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,500
My partner was asking some other question.

446
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,220
And the bond trader was adding a lot of clarifiers.

447
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,460
So, so basically I just called time out and I said, I slow it down and I say, how in the

448
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:28,700
world did DBTCA loan hundreds of millions of dollars without taking money out of other

449
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,520
client accounts?

450
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,100
That doesn't make any sense.

451
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:31,760
Right.

452
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,080
Said another way, how did this happen?

453
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,800
Right.

454
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,360
And they said, that's why we asked for this meeting.

455
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,380
Well, there is some good news and there's some bad news.

456
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,840
The good news is bad news.

457
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,320
The good news is these loans have been indemnified.

458
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:56,700
In fact, within two weeks or within two weeks of these loans happening, uh, hundreds of millions

459
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,080
of dollars were remitted from, uh, two foreign banks.

460
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,880
Remitted?

461
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,860
You just said it like that.

462
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,400
Two foreign.

463
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,380
Two foreign banks.

464
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:04,700
Okay.

465
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,220
Well, that's gotta be VTB.

466
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,520
Two foreign banks.

467
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Two, two foreign banks wired hundreds of millions of dollars into DBTCA.

468
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,320
Okay.

469
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,060
And I said, well, that doesn't make sense.

470
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,720
You mean clients of two banks, two foreign banks, right?

471
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,080
Right.

472
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,420
Yeah.

473
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,740
Clients of two foreign banks.

474
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,100
Okay.

475
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,580
So it's not really, okay, which banks?

476
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,280
And they said the two Russian banks.

477
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm like, oh, okay.

478
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,900
So it would be clients of VB and clients of the other one.

479
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,360
Right.

480
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:34,800
That's fair.

481
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,640
And they said, a client, and they said, a client of VB and a client of the other one.

482
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,460
Oh.

483
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,380
And I said, okay.

484
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
One, a client?

485
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,420
A single client.

486
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:45,880
Okay.

487
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,180
Single client.

488
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,660
Okay.

489
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:48,940
Okay.

490
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,360
And I said, well, okay.

491
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,220
All right.

492
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,260
Let's slow this down.

493
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,080
Let's just talk about VB.

494
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:04,320
Now, VB, when you say two foreign banks wired in hundreds of millions of dollars, you mean

495
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,960
a client of VB wired in hundreds, and a client of the other bank wired in hundreds.

496
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,040
So what did the client of VB do?

497
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,200
And they said, well, the client of VB signed basically an indemnity agreement so that they

498
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,300
could segregate this money within the trust away from the other principals and investors

499
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,080
in the trust.

500
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,560
Okay.

501
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,800
Can I just ask one question?

502
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,300
Oh, kind of like a...

503
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:34,500
Sorry.

504
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:34,760
Sorry.

505
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,820
Can I interrupt you for a second?

506
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,020
Yeah.

507
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,320
I just need to verify an indemnity agreement is just an under...

508
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,000
Is this someone that backs up the loan, right?

509
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,860
Because I'm thinking a double indemnity.

510
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,760
So, okay.

511
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,700
It's just a backup.

512
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,060
Okay.

513
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,920
So basically, I said you have an indemnity agreement for the trust.

514
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,920
The trust.

515
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,200
Okay.

516
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,960
So that they can say with a straight face that they didn't cross-contaminate any client

517
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,560
funds.

518
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,260
Okay.

519
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,680
Okay.

520
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,780
Do you have one of those?

521
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,820
And they showed it to me.

522
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,460
It was ribald.

523
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,560
Ribald, yeah.

524
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:03,900
Yeah.

525
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,220
Okay.

526
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,580
Jeez.

527
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,200
Okay.

528
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,140
Yeah.

529
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,660
And I didn't look at the other one.

530
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,220
I said, okay, we get the memo here.

531
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,720
All right.

532
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:23,080
And they said, so, do you think that we will be able to say that this loan was made by DBTCA

533
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:30,540
and that it has two indemnity agreements, and we can even say the banks that the indemnity

534
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:37,320
agreements came from, but do you think we can get away with doing a CLO where we describe

535
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,940
this loan without saying who the indemnitors are and who the indemnity is?

536
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:53,760
In other words, can we get away with just saying this is one of the loans that goes into

537
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:02,980
the pool, and the indemnity agreement is basically these two banks fortified by a client, and

538
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:13,140
it is client money, cash money, and it is segregated from the trust, and it is to a U.S. corporation.

539
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,080
Oh, a U.S. corporation.

540
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,280
That's it.

541
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,100
Oh, okay, interesting.

542
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:21,440
Like, not even say that it's Trump, and I said, not in a million years.

543
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,280
Look at the count, in 2008, like, the one thing the world learned to do after 2008 is

544
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,800
if you are looking at a CLO or a CDO, you are going to crawl all the way up the ass, and

545
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,440
you're going to look at every single loan, you're going to ask for every single indemnity

546
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,880
agreement, you're going to ask for every single segregated pool or SPV or consent agreement

547
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,240
or whatever it is, your clients are going to ask you for everything, everything, everything.

548
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,400
There's no way this is going to be stopped.

549
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,840
No way at all.

550
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,280
You're basically being asked to launder money, right?

551
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,680
That's kind of a classic money laundering.

552
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,580
So let's put this through a corporation.

553
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,980
I wouldn't go that far.

554
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,760
I mean, it could have been just a loan, and then the loan either gets defaulted on or gets

555
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,260
paid back.

556
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:20,860
Now, if there was some kind of a scheme where, you know, these two Russian bank clients, one

557
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:27,640
of them who was Bribovilev, if there had been some pre-arrangement where Trump Org would

558
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:35,400
borrow the money and then knowingly default, and then the lender would knowingly just have

559
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,820
a pre-arrangement to write it on.

560
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,360
Right.

561
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:44,200
And then it's just a loan, which isn't really income, that got defaulted on.

562
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:44,880
That's it, right.

563
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,680
Now, the way money laundering works is, you know, the person that got the loan that defaulted

564
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,400
on the loan would pick some of it back.

565
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,500
Now, I don't want to get way ahead of myself here and say, I know what I don't know.

566
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,060
I mean, I don't know any of that.

567
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:06,880
My point is, once upon a time, DB Americas got stuck.

568
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Once upon a time, DBTCA, by way of this Rosemary Clown.

569
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,700
But, I mean, they really stuck it to them and said, look, this is going to rot on the

570
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,400
books, and it will default, and it will cause all kinds of embarrassment, so why don't you

571
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,080
guys take it on the syndicate desk?

572
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,520
The syndicate desk?

573
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:26,720
No.

574
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,180
Okay.

575
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,440
Why don't you guys on the syndicate desk try to put it in a structured product and sell it?

576
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:31,800
Right.

577
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,360
And they said, well, we'll look into this.

578
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,460
I mean, look, the four guys in the room that they had no intention of trying to sell us

579
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:39,720
something.

580
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,620
They did not.

581
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,060
Okay.

582
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,540
They did not.

583
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:51,900
What they wanted to do was tell us the whole scenario and then hear our reaction.

584
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,060
And they all took very copious notes.

585
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,760
They all took copious notes, and they listened to every word of our responses.

586
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,060
They had listened to our questions.

587
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
They answered our questions.

588
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,020
They asked us questions.

589
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,140
We answered the questions.

590
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,160
I mean, this meeting went on for about two hours.

591
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,720
Lots and lots and lots of notes.

592
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,440
The trader had his laptop open.

593
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,680
He was typing in his notes the whole time.

594
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,060
Yeah.

595
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:24,140
And I think what they were trying to do was document, okay, we did talk to an institutional investor.

596
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,880
We talked to Knott Stuky in London.

597
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,560
And basically, here was the reaction.

598
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,100
Here's the notes to the file.

599
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,420
Okay.

600
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,240
And the reaction that these guys had, these guys have been around since the 80s.

601
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,500
These guys are here for all the crashes and crushes.

602
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,620
They've seen it all.

603
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,000
And this was their reaction.

604
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:46,740
Right.

605
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,120
So, once again, the answer is no.

606
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,440
This is crazy.

607
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,260
We can't just put this in a CLO or a CDO.

608
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,780
And, like, basically, the meeting ended with those guys just saying, hey, thanks for taking a meeting.

609
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,380
We really appreciate this.

610
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,780
It's important that everyone at DB is on the same page.

611
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,080
It's important that everyone understands this.

612
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,360
Huh.

613
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,240
Okay.

614
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:11,860
Yeah.

615
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:23,040
Because once upon a time, and, like, basically, it sounded to me like they were trying to load up the deck to really stick it to this Rosemary woman at DB2CA and get her fired.

616
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,760
Interesting.

617
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,100
Because they did a loan.

618
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,480
To me, is it possible it was for compliance?

619
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,940
Like, they wanted your reaction so they could say we spoke to you guys and they said no as well to the compliance team.

620
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,340
You know, as a presentation.

621
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,700
I don't think so.

622
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:44,260
I think the whole point of the meeting was to make the point, this is crazy.

623
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,720
Nobody gets out of this alive.

624
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,420
Nobody gets out of this alive now.

625
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:57,620
And, literally, these loans sit on the books until or if they default or get paid back.

626
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,200
And they're probably going to default.

627
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:07,320
And when they default, there's no way, there's no way that we can avoid disclosure.

628
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,200
Okay.

629
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,420
There's no way that we can avoid disclosure.

630
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,700
And then that blows up the whole DB2CA.

631
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,140
Look, it amazes me.

632
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,520
It amazes me that articles have been written and now a book has been written.

633
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:32,520
And nobody has focused on the fact, the fact, that DB2CA was the one that broke the loan.

634
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,040
Right.

635
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,000
That is crazy.

636
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,720
Hey, you're speaking to the, preaching to the choir here.

637
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,260
Thank you.

638
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:40,820
Thank you.

639
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,600
Crazy.

640
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,460
Now, why is it crazy?

641
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:56,120
Well, ask anyone with a high net worth account at DB2CA if they have a copy of a consent agreement.

642
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:56,880
Okay.

643
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,140
It's a real question.

644
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,060
It's a real question.

645
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,380
Okay.

646
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,100
Through all the connections you may have to people at DB, blah, blah, blah, high net worth people,

647
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,720
this is a good thing.

648
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,600
High net worth clients of DB2CA, step forward.

649
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,480
Do any of you have a, what's called a consent agreement?

650
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,780
Just a copy of a standard consent.

651
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:25,420
Because once upon a time, DB2CA, by their own admission, loaned hundreds of millions of dollars out of a trust.

652
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,900
Now, the trust had $20 billion.

653
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:28,960
Right.

654
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,700
But still, that's not the point.

655
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,640
We're right back to square one.

656
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:40,480
Okay, what's the big deal about one of your childhood buddies taking a $1 million loan out from a $20 million trust?

657
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,320
Oh, and he paid it back.

658
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:42,960
Right.

659
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,960
What's the big deal?

660
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,000
I'll tell you what the big deal is.

661
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,080
You cross-contaminated me.

662
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,020
You cross-contaminated your other two buddies, your other three buddies from childhood.

663
00:32:53,020 --> 00:33:04,700
In this instance, you're cross-contaminating each and every one of the other clients within their high net worth brokerage group.

664
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,340
And if that was disclosed, it was disclosed.

665
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,260
It amazes me.

666
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,460
They would pull their funds, right?

667
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,860
Yes.

668
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,200
It amazes me that no one has focused on that.

669
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:24,720
Now, if that is not true, if that is not true, that they are cross-contaminated, then there has to be an indemnity agreement.

670
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,820
There has to be an indemnity agreement.

671
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,020
And guess what?

672
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:36,440
All of the investors in the trust are entitled to see that indemnity agreement to confirm that they are not cross-contaminated.

673
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,060
Every single one in the trust?

674
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,420
Every single one of them.

675
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,920
Interesting.

676
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:54,740
Ask every single one of them, do you have an indemnity agreement that basically documents that you are not exposed to any material adverse change because DVTCA loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to Donald Trump?

677
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,360
Wow.

678
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,340
Do you have one of those?

679
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,040
Interesting.

680
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,020
If you don't have one of those, that's another red flag.

681
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,180
Okay?

682
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:02,800
Yeah.

683
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:10,140
That basically says, and then for them to say, well, there is an indemnity agreement, but we can't really talk about that.

684
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,380
Oh, really?

685
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:11,800
Okay.

686
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,480
Huh.

687
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,500
But that's...

688
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:21,980
Which is, sounds to me like, it sounds to me like where we're at now is maybe they have confessed to the indemnity agreements.

689
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,940
Maybe they haven't.

690
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,420
Mm-hmm.

691
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,580
But it doesn't sound to me like anyone is really making demands.

692
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,520
Huh.

693
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:41,580
If there is a default, and if it is, quote unquote, no big deal, it's not going to expose any of the other investors in the trust or the other high net worth contributors to the trust.

694
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,700
If that is true, who's stopping that out?

695
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,760
Who's what?

696
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,800
Who's stopping it out?

697
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,300
Who is indemnifying it?

698
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,320
Now, Scott came very close.

699
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,240
Yeah, they're good.

700
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,080
Look at the hundreds of millions of dollars that got wired in from Russian banks.

701
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,860
Well, you know, that's...

702
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,360
Okay, well...

703
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,100
Just so I...

704
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,020
That all came from me.

705
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,480
I gave Scott all that data.

706
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,820
Okay, okay, well...

707
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,120
I know.

708
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,200
It's all...

709
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,540
I know.

710
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,300
It's all Gazprom, Sparebank, and VTV.

711
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,800
And there's...

712
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,080
I have the breach report that says it's very clear.

713
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,580
Of course you do.

714
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,440
Of course you do.

715
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,760
And that's an excellent piece of information that confirms...

716
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:16,840
Yeah.

717
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,320
Sure, that confirms a lot of this.

718
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,260
But my point...

719
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,800
My point to you is it's not the bank.

720
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,760
Uh-huh.

721
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,700
It's not the bank.

722
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,200
It's the clients of the bank.

723
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,220
Banks don't just wire money to some fucking trust or some fucking bank in the private banking group.

724
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,020
Right, that's true.

725
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,800
I mean, Gazprom Bank, last I checked, is not a high net worth client of anyone's.

726
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,640
No, I know.

727
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,800
We're not looking to buy...

728
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,560
I mean...

729
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,780
Well, neither is Johnson & Johnson.

730
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,520
Johnson & Johnson has one billion parked there.

731
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,360
You know, it's shady.

732
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,280
I mean, I'm going through my father's emails.

733
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,220
Why does Johnson & Johnson have a billion dollars parked in DVTCA?

734
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,060
Exactly.

735
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,420
Right.

736
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,480
Exactly.

737
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,840
Okay, now, the answer to that question is they wouldn't.

738
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,400
Right.

739
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:12,780
The answer to that question in that room in 2013, in the fall of 2013, this is like October, November of 2013,

740
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,600
in that room, we all basically nodded in agreement at the end.

741
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,260
Yep, that's what it is.

742
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,540
Yep.

743
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,200
That's what it is.

744
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:37,480
Basically, the capital that got put into DPTCA by Gazprom and by BP is ostensibly nothing but just cash sitting there to indemnify a loan that they don't want to disclose anymore.

745
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,480
Yep.

746
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,060
And it's not the banks.

747
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,480
It is...

748
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,840
There's...

749
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:52,420
Basically, that's like you loaning your brother-in-law, if you have one, $100,000 to buy a house.

750
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,220
Like, your brother-in-law saw a nice house and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

751
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,900
My father's done that.

752
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,640
He wants $100,000.

753
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,560
My father did that.

754
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:58,720
Okay.

755
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,020
So, you wire money to your brother-in-law.

756
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,360
Yep.

757
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,240
$100,000.

758
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:03,560
Yep.

759
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,040
And he sees a wire come in from Bank of America.

760
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,020
Did Bank of America loan him $100,000?

761
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:10,580
Right.

762
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,260
No, of course not.

763
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,480
No.

764
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,580
You did.

765
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:12,940
Right.

766
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,220
That's the way banks work, right?

767
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,600
Of course.

768
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,400
Banks have clients.

769
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:15,640
Right.

770
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,280
Banks don't...

771
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,180
Banks aren't high-net-worth clients.

772
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,720
Banks aren't private banking clients looking to do a non-revocable trust for their fucking grandkids.

773
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,320
So...

774
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,020
What are you kidding me?

775
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,880
So, why would they put on the balance sheet?

776
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,440
Why would they put Gazprom and not the actual client?

777
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,300
It's a mistake.

778
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,080
Do you think so?

779
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,720
It's a mistake.

780
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
Do you think it was a purposeful mistake?

781
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,900
I think it's a mistake.

782
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,840
By design?

783
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,180
The only reason why anyone knows about that is the breach reports.

784
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,920
Is the breach reports?

785
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,340
Yeah.

786
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,920
The breach reports.

787
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,500
The breach reports basically spread the virus, as it were.

788
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,040
Yeah.

789
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,360
Okay?

790
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,780
Yeah.

791
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,580
Now, but really focus here.

792
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:56,960
Yeah.

793
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,240
As far as DB Americas was concerned,

794
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,920
they couldn't disclose to anyone who the indemnidor was without the consent of Rosemary Revol...

795
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,800
Whatever her name was.

796
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,360
Revolving.

797
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,840
Why did they need her consent?

798
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,520
Client confidentiality.

799
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,040
Client confidentiality.

800
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,440
Really?

801
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:17,820
Okay.

802
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,300
You can't just run out in the street and say, it's this guy's...

803
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,860
But they showed us one of them.

804
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,840
They showed us one of the indemnity agreements,

805
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,980
and it was not VV Bank.

806
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,460
It was their client.

807
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,140
It was Rob Althamon.

808
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,480
And there was another one.

809
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,280
I didn't see...

810
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,240
I didn't see the signature on the other one.

811
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,300
Did anyone mention Victor Vechteberg?

812
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,760
I recall the name, but that's it.

813
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,300
That's it.

814
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:41,660
Okay.

815
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,800
Interesting.

816
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,040
Okay.

817
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,040
Wow.

818
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,260
That's all I know.

819
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,500
That's a lot.

820
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,860
That's all I know, but that's a lot, okay?

821
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,420
It's huge.

822
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:51,700
Yeah.

823
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,280
That's great.

824
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,240
Wow.

825
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,340
What do you think about going on the record ever?

826
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,500
I will.

827
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,060
You will?

828
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,420
I will.

829
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,560
That'd be great, man.

830
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:00,880
I will.

831
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,580
That'd be great.

832
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,460
I mean, we need you.

833
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,260
And this is important.

834
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,400
It won't be sometime tomorrow morning.

835
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,260
Okay?

836
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,300
I got you, yeah.

837
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,780
I will be thoughtful to get back to you again.

838
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,200
Okay.

839
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,520
I've heard from Rocco via this Twitter thing,

840
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,620
and I've heard from Sandy.

841
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,260
But I would be glad to add the clarifiers,

842
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,440
but in two hours, I think I learned a lot.

843
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,340
Yeah.

844
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,220
And I think I'm just describing to you what it is.

845
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,340
What did you think of my father?

846
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,500
I mean, he was there, yeah?

847
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,800
What was he doing there?

848
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,500
I think, to be clear, I didn't know him.

849
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:40,840
Yeah.

850
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,680
He was just, as far as I could see, just quiet.

851
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,700
He was the best guy.

852
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:45,980
Yeah.

853
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,480
He was quiet.

854
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,640
And polite.

855
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,500
I mean, I can't make more of this than what I told you.

856
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,140
I mean, that's what I remember.

857
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,720
I knew the other guy.

858
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,660
I knew Juergen.

859
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,320
You knew Juergen.

860
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,680
Okay.

861
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,600
Okay.

862
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,800
I'm just curious as to just, you know, it's good to hear.

863
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,580
Anyone that's met my father, it's always good to hear a story or something.

864
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:07,980
Yeah.

865
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,380
I think the one thing that I would add with emphasis is like,

866
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,320
at DB, you had good guys and you had bad guys.

867
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:16,580
Yeah.

868
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,580
These were the good guys.

869
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,760
We met with the good guys.

870
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,100
Yeah.

871
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,660
The good guys wanted to do something that was, they wanted to do the right thing.

872
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,260
They did.

873
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,600
Yeah.

874
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,460
That's my father.

875
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,600
It sounds like him.

876
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:27,940
All right.

877
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,020
And he was a good guy.

878
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,800
And in essence, it was just, it was just such a hot mess.

879
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,560
I mean, no one there, no one there could believe it, that they, they took, they wouldn't take

880
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,940
no for an answer and they, they did it within the trust.

881
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,540
That was really reckless.

882
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,160
Wow.

883
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,000
And so it's very crazy.

884
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,180
So what do you think if I was going to get a hold of these loans, let's say I had like

885
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:58,100
a magic key that could open up any computer in the world, where computer would I go for?

886
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,280
Within DPTCA, there is a general counsel's office.

887
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:11,940
Okay.

888
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,180
Mark Stein?

889
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,320
Mark Stein?

890
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,560
Mark Stein.

891
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,040
General counsel, general counsel.

892
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:19,440
Okay.

893
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,280
Got it.

894
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,360
General counsel's office.

895
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,080
Interesting.

896
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,880
That's where they would keep the loan.

897
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,380
I wouldn't be, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if the original box are in his office.

898
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,500
Okay.

899
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,040
They would be computerized there as well.

900
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,320
Yeah.

901
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,660
They'd be scanned there.

902
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,680
That's fascinating.

903
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,240
Okay.

904
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,760
Did you, did you have any interactions with, with like a Michele Faisola by any chance?

905
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,280
He's the head of wealth and asset management.

906
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,020
I would think that he would be there because he was, he was the head of wealth asset management.

907
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:53,980
Nope.

908
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,800
He wasn't there.

909
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,460
He was not there.

910
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:55,820
Okay.

911
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,220
That's interesting.

912
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:07,260
This was strictly, this was strictly, this was strictly DB Americas trying to figure it out with us and trying to, trying to basically go back with something.

913
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,040
And it was all because of this Trump, just because of fucking Trump, huh?

914
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:20,780
And so his loan was so severe, it was such a big, massive breach that it would take down the rest of this Trump and if it defaulted.

915
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,260
And what was, I mean, it's interesting that yesterday the news comes out about the loan.

916
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,880
And, uh, that couldn't be the same loan, did it?

917
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,360
Well, this is some years later, but I have a hard time believing those loans were ever paid back.

918
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,140
You don't think so?

919
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,720
It's not that way.

920
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,200
Okay.

921
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,140
Um...

922
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,200
Do you know how much we're talking about?

923
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,440
Look, I mean, we, we, we don't, we don't know what we don't know.

924
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:47,880
Right.

925
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,740
I mean, look, the guy is always broke.

926
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,440
Yeah.

927
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,280
He's always broke.

928
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,460
He's always asking for money.

929
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,320
And he's an opportunist.

930
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,500
So, of course he's out there asking for money and concessions.

931
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,780
I mean, even if he wasn't dead broke, and he probably is.

932
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,480
He'd do it anyway.

933
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,380
He'd still be trying to rock and, he'd still be trying to rock and roll and get the better of somebody and slip away.

934
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,100
And, which is why nobody in their right mind would lend money to him.

935
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,500
That's right.

936
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,880
Except for...

937
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:21,920
That is exactly why nobody will do business with him, except for apparently this woman at TV, who's no longer there, I understand.

938
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,740
Nah, she's gone.

939
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,280
Where's my problem?

940
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,060
Well, actually, technically she is.

941
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:32,220
They have her employed, because the, uh, we just spoke to one of their lawyers and said that they, she is employed still.

942
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,760
Um, on some level.

943
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,640
She is.

944
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,400
I think that they have her there so she can't talk, is my guess.

945
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,880
Um, but Tom Bowers...

946
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,860
That makes sense, yeah.

947
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,780
Tom Bowers was, uh, her boss.

948
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,260
And you heard about him, right?

949
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:45,660
Uh-huh.

950
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,880
He killed himself just recently.

951
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,880
And, uh, Tom Bowers supposedly has the, uh, these documents as well.

952
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,420
I gotta fight...

953
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,060
In Malibu, yeah.

954
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,780
Yeah, in Malibu.

955
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:07,040
Um, and David Enrich, who I do not like at all, he's much, very much opportunist, and I did not see it coming, and I couldn't believe how, uh, I couldn't believe...

956
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,940
I mean, it was, it's unbelievable what he wrote, but the book, he was much kinder than the article to me.

957
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,620
And he was good to my father, so that was, that was, that was the best part of it, but...

958
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:16,880
Yeah.

959
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,940
Um, Tom Bowers gave David, uh, some loan, uh, loan agreements, loan documents.

960
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:37,800
And the, the, the, the consensus amongst, uh, the Deutsche Bank, I can't remember which lawyer it was, uh, not the head lawyer, it was the, it was some sort of intern type lawyer who said that these were all fraudulent documents.

961
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,880
That's his stance, and that's where he's been, the, the word around...

962
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh.

963
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah, he said fraudulent documents.

964
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,060
Well, I don't know what that, I don't know what that means, there's all kinds of ways, there's all kinds of things that could be fraud.

965
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,500
Well, there's, basically, there's, so, God, what's his name?

966
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:05,400
Uh, some, uh, talk show, a talking head guy, uh, Chris O'Donnell, or something, Lawrence O'Donnell, uh, went on to the news and said,

967
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:16,540
I have these loan documents, um, that shows that, in fact, uh, Trump's loans were, Deutsche Bank loans were, in fact, underwritten by, uh, Russian banks.

968
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,760
Uh, and, uh, the next day, he goes on the air.

969
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,320
That's not true, that's not true.

970
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,180
No, the banks...

971
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:22,940
Were identified, sorry.

972
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,200
D-B-T-C-A, D-B-T-C-A wrote the loans, there's no doubt about that.

973
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:28,860
But, I'm sorry, I...

974
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,320
Who identified the loans?

975
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:30,880
I've been...

976
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,720
Who identified the loans?

977
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:31,860
Yeah.

978
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,160
This is, this is very different.

979
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,280
You know, I had the wrong language.

980
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,860
The identity agreement?

981
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,300
Yeah.

982
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:35,840
Yeah.

983
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,060
Yeah, sorry, I had the wrong language.

984
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,200
I mean, identified the loans, identified the loans, were, uh, Russian oligarchs.

985
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:51,220
He said, he said the word oligarchs on air, and Deutsche Bank called him and said that you cannot, you have to retract this right away, um, the loan documents...

986
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,220
Oh, what he said was true.

987
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,280
What he said was true.

988
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,360
I, I, I, I'm one of maybe a few...

989
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,820
I'm one of not very many people in the world who have seen one of those.

990
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,740
I know, it's amazing.

991
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,480
It's amazing.

992
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,180
Um...

993
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,320
It's, it is true.

994
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:03,940
It is true.

995
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,620
They are lying.

996
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,140
It is true.

997
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,940
I know they're lying.

998
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,740
Those fuckers, man.

999
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,320
I knew it.

1000
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,180
Um, yeah, they're saying everything's fraudulent, and they made him take that, retract,

1001
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,740
his statements.

1002
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,820
The lawyer said, if you don't retract that statement, we're coming after you and the network.

1003
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,400
So he retracted it the next day.

1004
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,180
He should have invited it.

1005
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,320
He should have invited it.

1006
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,220
I know, right?

1007
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:23,800
Exactly.

1008
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,560
That's what I said.

1009
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,480
That's the problem.

1010
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,580
That's one of the problems, is, like, you let it rip, and they threaten to sue you.

1011
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:29,940
Yeah.

1012
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,500
Let them.

1013
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:30,920
Let them.

1014
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,140
Discovery's a...

1015
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:32,380
Yeah.

1016
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,080
Discovery's a bitch, right?

1017
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,300
Discovery's a bitch.

1018
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,640
And this national spotlight's even more unforgiving.

1019
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,220
Yep.

1020
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:39,280
Yep.

1021
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:40,800
Exactly.

1022
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,180
I don't know why they would blink, but, uh, I, look, I don't know if he saw something

1023
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:52,080
or if he was just being told something secondhand, but I saw it in 2013.

1024
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,620
Yep.

1025
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,120
I remember, I remember every single detail about that meeting.

1026
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,580
Every single one.

1027
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,800
Because it was so terrible.

1028
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,340
Because, and the reason why that is, is it was just so bizarre.

1029
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,720
It was really...

1030
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,580
It was so bizarre.

1031
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,040
It was something straight out of a movie, almost.

1032
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,660
It was like, it was weird.

1033
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,000
It was wildly inappropriate.

1034
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,240
And, like, to be clear, the D.B. America's guys were not trying to sell us something.

1035
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,380
They were trying to, like, they were trying to get this figured out with us.

1036
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,800
And then to go back to the wealth people and tell them why they were so crazy.

1037
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,260
But so they knew, I mean, my dad would have known right away, and this is ridiculous.

1038
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,620
He would have known, he did know right away.

1039
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,260
They all knew right away.

1040
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:41,120
So why would the purpose of calling in a third party would be to have on the record

1041
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,020
that there was a third party that also objects to this, right?

1042
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:48,780
They were asked to pitch this, and they came to us and said, hey, we're pitching this.

1043
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,100
Like, we're not, yeah, we're going through the motions here.

1044
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,900
Who do you think asked?

1045
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,720
Huh?

1046
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,700
Who do you think asked to pitch it to you?

1047
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,980
I mean, who do you think asked my father's group?

1048
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:07,180
We knew all the people at D.B. London very, very well.

1049
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:07,780
Okay.

1050
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,940
Let's just put it that way.

1051
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:15,540
I mean, basically, they trusted us to sit down and figure this out with them so that

1052
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:21,900
they could go back with a file and say, you wanted us to pitch this to a serious group?

1053
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:22,360
We did.

1054
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:22,920
Okay.

1055
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:30,340
This is a group that could have referred us to these five family offices and these other hedge funds.

1056
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,800
When you say you wanted us, when you're quoting them, you said, hey, you wanted us to pitch

1057
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,440
it and we did, who are they talking to?

1058
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,060
Who's the you?

1059
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,860
Is that Anshu?

1060
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,600
Is that...

1061
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,780
Not Stooky.

1062
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,400
No, we're not Stooky.

1063
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,080
No, no, I'm sorry.

1064
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,400
I'm not explaining myself.

1065
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:50,780
Like, who do you think was the party at Deutsche Bank that asked my father and the group

1066
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,740
that you spoke to to bring this to you?

1067
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,940
Juergen did that on his own.

1068
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,980
He did on his own.

1069
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,260
Okay.

1070
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:06,100
He was getting pressure from DBTCA's managing director in charge of blah, blah, blah.

1071
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,100
They were all just...

1072
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,220
They were basically a firing squad in a circle over at DBTCA.

1073
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:19,360
My father went to DBTCA to clean it up in September, October, 2013.

1074
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,680
That was his whole...

1075
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,900
He was retiring.

1076
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,080
That would have been right after the meeting.

1077
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,460
Right after?

1078
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:26,920
No, no.

1079
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,820
He was still...

1080
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,520
October...

1081
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,940
Because he retired technically September, but he went right to work at DBTCA immediately.

1082
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,540
So he was...

1083
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,080
I see the emails from November and October, and he's asking...

1084
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,600
He's trying to clean everything up, and no one's listening to him.

1085
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,920
So if you say there's a managing director giving Juergen pressure...

1086
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,920
When did he...

1087
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,900
When did he start at DBTCA again?

1088
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:47,280
When?

1089
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,200
Around September.

1090
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,500
End of September of 2013.

1091
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,600
Or middle September.

1092
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,720
This meeting...

1093
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,920
This meeting would have been either right before...

1094
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,760
Yeah.

1095
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,860
He went over, or right after.

1096
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,220
Okay.

1097
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,520
It sounds like after.

1098
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,920
And the guy...

1099
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,200
No.

1100
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,520
And the guy at DBTCA, who had pressured this meeting to happen...

1101
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,160
Yeah.

1102
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,300
It was not your dad.

1103
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,000
It was definitely not.

1104
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,200
It was not your dad.

1105
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,400
Okay.

1106
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,320
It was another higher-up guy who was just...

1107
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,760
Again, another...

1108
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,340
Oh, the French guy.

1109
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:19,720
Okay.

1110
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,640
The French guy, yeah.

1111
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:20,980
Yes.

1112
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,720
Another can't-take-no-for-an-answer guy.

1113
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,500
You know, Jean-Philippe or something like that.

1114
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1115
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:28,920
Yeah, yeah.

1116
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,180
Okay.

1117
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,860
And just...

1118
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,440
And just...

1119
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,280
They wouldn't let it go.

1120
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,100
They wouldn't let it go.

1121
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:39,580
And they finally figured, you know, this group that we met with, the 4DB Americas guy,

1122
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,480
said, look, we just need to acquit ourselves of this.

1123
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,140
Right.

1124
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:44,960
So we're gonna...

1125
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,440
Let's go through this with you once.

1126
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,320
Let's fill a file up.

1127
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,400
Ask all your questions.

1128
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,340
And, like, at the end of the meeting, it was just like, well, that was crazy.

1129
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,400
Let's go get pints next Wednesday.

1130
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:57,780
Right.

1131
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,800
I mean, that was the thing.

1132
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,800
We'd go over to the old...

1133
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,180
Go over to the...

1134
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,420
Go over to the banger around the corner and have a few pints.

1135
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,140
And that was it.

1136
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:07,580
The banger, yeah.

1137
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,420
That's great.

1138
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,040
Man, okay.

1139
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:10,880
This is great.

1140
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,400
Thank you, man.

1141
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,380
This is fantastic.

1142
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,140
This is huge.

1143
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,420
So we gotta do something about this.

1144
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,780
I mean, I know, of course, you can't go on the record tomorrow.

1145
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,140
I don't know who to...

1146
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,500
I know...

1147
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,100
I'm gonna find out.

1148
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,040
I'm a month or two...

1149
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,780
I'm gonna find out.

1150
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm a month or two away from...

1151
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,180
Yeah?

1152
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,140
I'm a month or two away from, like, basically...

1153
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,740
I'm gonna retire at the end of the year.

1154
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,220
Okay.

1155
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,440
I mean, I can't embarrass the firm while I'm there.

1156
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:35,940
Sure.

1157
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,200
And just...

1158
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,240
You know, I'm trying to get an avenue to travel by so I can talk.

1159
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,180
I understand.

1160
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,240
But...

1161
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,480
But I gotta figure that out.

1162
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,580
But, like, Sandy has been guilting me.

1163
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,400
Val, you gotta get Trump out of their office now, now.

1164
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,180
I'm like, come on, Sandy.

1165
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,720
Give me a break.

1166
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,460
He's like, come on.

1167
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,880
There are millions of lives at stake.

1168
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,340
I'm like, what?

1169
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,700
He's like, well, with the virus.

1170
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,820
He's gonna fuck it all up.

1171
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,760
And people are gonna die.

1172
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,180
And then I started thinking about that.

1173
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,540
I was like, fuck, maybe she's right.

1174
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:03,960
You know?

1175
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,820
So I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this.

1176
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,800
I mean, if we can...

1177
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,880
And I'm just worried that now, because this virus is taking over the media,

1178
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,620
no one's gonna even care about Trump's loans.

1179
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,940
That's what I'm worried about.

1180
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,060
So maybe it's a timing issue as well.

1181
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,240
Well, look.

1182
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:21,620
Look.

1183
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,320
Karma has a way of working, eventually.

1184
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,300
Eventually?

1185
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,900
I hope so.

1186
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,640
I mean, come on.

1187
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,960
Trump's president.

1188
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,840
How's karma work?

1189
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:30,840
Here's...

1190
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,200
Here...

1191
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:31,700
I know.

1192
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,200
I know.

1193
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,180
Well, karma took its time this time.

1194
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,720
But here's my point.

1195
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,060
Yeah.

1196
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,540
I think he's...

1197
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,000
I think he's dead broke.

1198
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,680
Yeah.

1199
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,620
Dead broke.

1200
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,020
Yeah.

1201
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,200
He's ass up.

1202
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,260
And now he's gotta go back to them.

1203
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:46,940
Yeah.

1204
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:47,820
Again.

1205
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:48,960
I agree.

1206
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,620
And guess what?

1207
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,920
It is impossible for them to do business with him now.

1208
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:53,940
Impossible.

1209
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,500
Yeah.

1210
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,860
Impossible.

1211
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:03,160
I mean, it was close to impossible in 2013, long before this whole shit show.

1212
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,840
Well, he's just gonna go to Russian banks.

1213
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,260
I bet you anything.

1214
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,140
He's gonna go right back to those guys.

1215
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,260
You know what?

1216
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,220
But you know what?

1217
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,220
It's...

1218
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,580
It's...

1219
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,640
All I'm saying is that is, like...

1220
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,340
Back in the day, I mean, he had a lot of eyes on him.

1221
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,240
He had a lot of people chasing him in the media.

1222
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:23,780
Yeah.

1223
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah.

1224
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,840
Back in the day, he had a lot of attention.

1225
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,780
Now he's under the world's biggest microscope.

1226
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,360
Yeah.

1227
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,460
And, look, I've met the guy just once.

1228
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,580
That was in 1990.

1229
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:34,300
Okay.

1230
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,000
He's not a smart guy.

1231
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,660
I know.

1232
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,340
He's an idiot.

1233
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:38,780
Of course.

1234
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,380
He's a moron.

1235
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,120
And his kids are as dumb as the day is long.

1236
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:44,800
Oh, my God.

1237
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,640
And just...

1238
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,140
Look, at some point, at some point, the jig is up.

1239
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,460
Yeah.

1240
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,840
Like, people have to say, I just can't help you.

1241
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:55,360
Yeah.

1242
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,020
That's right.

1243
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,860
I'm sorry.

1244
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,160
You'll just have to take your medicine like everybody else.

1245
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:00,680
That's right.

1246
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,160
Hopefully, it's not...

1247
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,720
You know, what if he's out of office is when the jig is up?

1248
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,080
We want him out now and to let that happen quick, as fast as possible.

1249
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,620
You know what?

1250
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:13,800
You know what?

1251
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,640
If the noose tightens enough...

1252
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:17,820
Yeah.

1253
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,440
If the noose tightens enough, he really needs the money that badly.

1254
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:23,860
Yeah.

1255
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,840
Don't be surprised if he just...

1256
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,480
Don't be surprised if one day just straight out of nowhere he quits.

1257
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,880
Yeah.

1258
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,800
Yeah, exactly.

1259
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,000
That's what I was thinking, too.

1260
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:31,820
It could...

1261
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,980
It's not likely, but it's not an impossibility.

1262
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:40,060
And he'll just take whatever he's built up while he's in office to try and make...

1263
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,300
Just to try and monetize that, of course.

1264
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,840
And then when everyone turns their back on him, then there'll be something else.

1265
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,560
I just hope...

1266
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,560
If that happens while he's in office, that could be very dangerous for everybody in the world.

1267
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,080
That's what I'm worried about.

1268
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,480
If people start turning their back on him now, for money-wise, he will act out.

1269
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:58,440
Right?

1270
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:58,780
Yeah.

1271
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,580
So, let's let that happen after the presidency.

1272
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,180
I'll tell you what.

1273
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,200
I've got to meet someone for a late supper.

1274
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:06,780
Okay.

1275
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,160
And I will...

1276
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,580
I'll keep the thing open.

1277
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,640
I'll get a signal.

1278
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,980
I will get a signal.

1279
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,480
Okay.

1280
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,380
I'll let you know, okay?

1281
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:14,960
All right, man.

1282
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,680
Can I get a first name so I don't call you Kaiser?

1283
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,700
Even though I like Kaiser.

1284
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,280
That's a good name.

1285
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,320
No, we can do that.

1286
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,220
It's Colin.

1287
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:21,760
Colin.

1288
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,340
Okay, Colin.

1289
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:22,740
Colin.

1290
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:23,800
Thanks, Colin.

1291
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,280
All right.

1292
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,780
And please stay in touch, okay?

1293
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:27,580
I will.

1294
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,000
Okay.

1295
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,560
All right, man.

1296
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:28,880
Thanks.

1297
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,480
Cheers.

1298
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:29,940
Bye.

1299
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,240
Bye.

1300
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:32,840
Okay.

1301
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:33,860
I wouldn't care.

1302
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,060
Yeah.
