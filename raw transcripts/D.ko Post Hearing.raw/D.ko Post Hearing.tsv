0	1920	but uh...
1920	5000	i don't know if we just have a bad lawyer
5000	8460	i don't know that means being that made me think of you know because
8460	10280	if you can get this thing just
10280	14520	to go away drop whatever you can save us some money with his lawyer
14520	15960	in the in the energy
15960	17000	misery
17000	18880	i don't like lawyers
18880	19480	uh...
19480	21440	i don't know why if that makes you feel any better
21440	24000	it doesn't deal with the fair amount of them unfortunately
24000	26240	yeah it's no fun
26240	28640	i hear you man
28640	32720	uh... i am looking into a couple things uh...
32720	38400	so uh... to answer your question uh... you said you wanted to talk to uh... your lawyer mike
38400	40080	yeah what uh...
40080	42640	what would it be that you'd want to tell them
42640	44800	well i think it would be great to
44800	47000	tell him that uh...
47000	52880	like he says that basically what we decided after speaking with you is that uh...
52880	56120	and you know what i fucked up after so all my life i thought erroneous meant
56120	57600	uh... arbitrary
57600	60160	i guess erroneous means wrong and accurate
60160	64640	so uh... so sabba's uh... this woman's testimony this ridiculous thing she
64640	65800	put together
65800	70120	uh... it's very bizarre as everyone is said including the judge
70120	71240	uh... you there
71240	72720	yeah
72720	74120	oh no can you hear me now
74120	76240	how about this
76240	79040	uh... about the sabba's erroneous uh... report
79040	84040	right right she's saying that now the erroneous uh... the fbis uh... report was
84040	85640	erroneous
85640	90240	this is what he said and he we need so he needs uh... tim and jammy
90240	92560	and you since you spoke to uh...
92560	95960	you know tim and jammy could i guess verify or vouch
95960	98240	uh... is you are not the guy
98240	100800	uh... you did not speak to sabba
100800	102160	and uh...
102160	104440	this is a little bit maybe
104440	106400	i'm not sure it's my connection or
106400	107400	i don't know
107400	108680	mine i'm driving so
108680	110000	oh you're driving
110000	113680	uh... you were saying tim and jammy's
114600	118920	yes so tim so as we figured out last night uh... tim never spoke to sabba
118920	119520	okay
119520	123080	so she wrote and she wrote down that she directly spoke to tim
123080	124040	uh...
124040	126800	so that's a problem that's erroneous and that's it
126800	127440	that's it
127440	130920	i don't know if she did or not
130920	133240	i don't know if she talked to tim
133240	135000	i know that i've never talked to him
135000	137440	that you never... right you're the one that
137440	140080	right this is as long as you tell him you never speak spoke to any of these
140080	141840	people that'd be great
141840	144200	uh... maybe ask him what you could
144200	149040	if there's what does he need what could he do to help to have this go away now
149040	152880	uh... and suss him out and he spoke with more lawyers and i probably have
152880	156560	this guy want money is this guy trying to drag this thing out to get more money
156560	158720	or is he uh...
158720	161160	a good lawyer i don't know what do you think
161160	165680	uh... and then also like he's trying to call jim and timmy to get them to say
165680	169440	we never spoke with sabba this is uh... someone made this shit up
169440	172640	and had he done that i think this morning and jim and timmy had picked up the
172640	173400	phone
173400	179840	i don't think there'd be a case
179840	182840	let me see this
182840	186240	remember what we talked about at first was that we need to keep
186240	189320	specifically my involvement
189320	192560	and i haven't told anybody
192560	196640	and i didn't think you would but the thing is if i tell your lawyer
196640	199280	your lawyer is also under no obligation to
199280	203640	not put my name everywhere and put in court documents that are publicly available
203640	204800	and things like that
204800	208680	so that's what we have to be careful on how we want to address it
208680	212760	uh... more than likely what i would do since he already talked to tim
212760	216720	i may have tim talked to him on my behalf or something like that or clarify
216720	218560	something
218560	220840	because tim's investigation is already
220840	225520	what it is and there's articles written about it and your guys or whatever right now
225520	226520	there's nothing
226520	228920	covert about what tim's doing
228920	230320	if i call him and i say hey
230320	233440	my name is david and i've never talked to this lady sabba and he's gonna be like
233440	235200	well who the hell are you
235200	239440	i'll say well i'm the agent of houston and like well why is he talking, why are you talking about?
239440	241800	and then he's like well you know
241800	243400	it leads down a lot of
243400	244400	of course
244400	245800	we don't want to go down
245800	251040	i'm just going off the plateau we hit last night when he said give me the
251040	255000	lawyer's number and perhaps you could call him if you come up with an idea so i thought
255000	258760	this would be a good chance
258760	262000	uh... i never got the lawyer's number
262000	266600	either i didn't write it down but usually if he tells me i write it maybe i said it and
266600	267320	he kind of like
267320	269120	oh no i never got it
269120	270520	i texted it to you
270520	272320	did you not receive the text yeah
272320	273320	oh no
273320	275320	let me take my text
275320	277000	i just picked my notes but i didn't see it
277000	279880	but uh... i'll double check my text again
279880	282960	yeah that would be a big problem if you're not getting these texts then they're going
282960	284960	to somebody else and that's not good i've got you
284960	287160	right here i'm talking to you now
287160	289000	and i've texted it to
289000	292000	uh... let me just double check
292000	293120	two eight one
293120	296400	two eight one four one four six two three three
296400	297400	yeah that's it
297400	298640	okay good
298640	302800	and by the way the uh...
302800	307920	congratulations on congressional medal of bravery that's amazing
307920	308920	it's very amazing
308920	311480	yeah unfortunately that's all out there yeah i know
311480	313480	pretty cool though man pretty cool
313480	315360	i felt a lot more confident when i read that
315360	316920	very good
316920	318800	top marks for you
318800	322680	that was something that we didn't really deserve to get we're just doing our job and there's
322680	323920	lots of other people who did
323920	326120	a lot more than i did i'll tell you that right now
326120	327280	yeah well said
327280	328760	good answer
328760	330000	good answer
330000	331960	um but yeah okay
331960	333760	yeah please let me know
333760	337080	yeah i'll double check some stuff i'm still doing some things so
337080	338080	like i said what
338080	340400	i'll probably come up with is
340400	345800	i'll have to find out what it is that we need to do to resolve the court situation
345800	348240	which unfortunately is not an easy list
348240	351240	just for my, i don't know, the day of
351240	353920	digging around and trying to figure things out
353920	356280	uh... it's not going to be something that's going to be resolved overnight
356280	357280	i know
357280	359240	i can only be honest with you
359240	362680	right i can't promise you the world if i can't give it to you
362680	365800	sure and i appreciate that
365800	369120	and uh... so right now i'm looking at things trying to figure out what
369120	371360	uh... what our best
371360	372880	get so to speak
372880	373720	uh...
373720	375160	did you know
375160	378640	did you know there's no due process in this court system this this dependency
378640	380400	court in this dcv
380400	384640	yeah it's a civil process which is different than a criminal process
384640	387040	uh... so criminal processes you know
387040	390320	it's beyond a reasonable doubt and that's the standard for conviction
390320	392560	civil court cases it's uh...
392560	395040	preponderance of the evidence i believe so
395040	396360	well but there was no evidence
396360	399640	you can go now you can actually go in with pure hearsay and this is what the
399640	404080	lawyer just just prove to us pure hearsay the neighbors can go say yes uh...
404080	408440	you know uh... these guys are these guys are shaving chipmunks every you know
408440	411000	that's what they do they shave chipmunks and they sell the hair
411000	415080	and then there's no proof for evidence but they have to accept that as fact
415080	417480	the judge has to accept it as fact
417480	418800	or as true
418800	419520	i don't think
419520	422440	well i don't think they have to accept it as fact but
422760	426440	the standard for evidence is a lot looser i know what you mean
426440	429800	in other words it just doesn't have to believe that that's true because obviously
429800	431240	you've got all sorts like
431240	433880	unfortunately like i said i've dealt with this before
433880	437320	you know crazy ex-spouses claim all sorts of stupid shit
437320	438280	and
438280	440440	luckily for the most part
440440	442680	uh... we can kind of cut through some of the bullshit
442680	444600	but
444600	448760	but what we'll talk about on wednesday is just trying to figure out if there's
448760	451400	you know anything else that we should know about
451400	453160	you know when we go and talk to them because
453160	455080	i don't want to look like a chapped ass if
455080	455560	you know
455560	457880	if we put a neck out on the line and say hey
457880	458600	you know
458600	460680	this is this is we know that valk
460680	463560	guy and he's not a serial killer and turns out you know okay i got
463560	465240	10 chopped up kids in the back truck you know
465240	467240	yeah yeah i got you
467240	468120	of course yeah
468120	471640	so uh but that's why on on wednesday we're gonna talk a little bit more
471640	472680	depth about that
472680	473480	about
473480	475000	what you can tell us because

645400	649400	different story though um i'm really bad at lying to her i can lie
649400	653160	really well to everyone else but not to her i so i have to figure out
653160	659400	half-truth

667000	673400	that'd be great
679400	683400	i was gonna even read my number as well okay

732120	735560	investigator assigned to our case and he's gonna investigate us
735560	739080	um they've already spoken with marlowe and marlowe loves me and he keeps telling
739080	743880	him how much they love me so that's the good news and then to steve chagrin he
743880	748280	does not like to hear that at all um but it's really nice it was really nice
748280	751720	to hear the psychiatrist say marlowe just loves val
751720	757000	um so that's really good and then and there's uh uh what else is there
757000	763240	so the so the judge i can't see or talk to marlowe until
763240	766920	i get special permission from the judge or the hearing that's pissing me off
767000	770680	that's like horrible and the thing that's five weeks from now
771240	775000	i'm not allowed to speak because of the allegations i'm not allowed to speak
775000	779000	to marlowe or even see him on the court well marie's allowed to see him three
779000	782680	times a week i can't even see him i can't even talk to him on the phone

788440	799960	terrible
809160	813960	and uh yeah she or he will deliver a report of some sort and uh the the report
813960	817880	will go to the judge and then the hearing will be based on that report the next
817960	831400	step yeah
838840	843400	okay
843400	846920	sure right

864840	869720	yeah it is yeah it's exactly what they told what the our lawyer told the judge
869720	873160	and but the judge i was so frustrated to hear the judge has to take that
873960	879640	by law has to accept that report and that's and they must have known that shaba and the
879640	883880	others must have known that which is why they made it so severe i mean i do you still do you
