[01:23.320 --> 01:28.040]  Tim: thank you for everything you gave us and my my response to them was hey can you
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.760]  Tim: guys manage what Val's giving and I'll manage the other aspects and I should
[01:32.760 --> 01:37.440]  Tim: have been on top of them or more I apologize 
Val: It's okay
Tim: one other thing that I mean
[01:37.440 --> 01:40.280]  Tim: now that now that the cat's out of the hat and that he sent that report the
[01:40.280 --> 01:44.760]  Tim: other thing I did mention to the gentleman was "hey listen I was in their
[01:44.760 --> 01:52.080]  Tim: house and I'm not at you know I'm not a an expert in you know in child services
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.720]  Tim: I think but you know he appears to be loved he had a dedicated you know nice
[01:58.720 --> 02:03.600]  Tim: child friendly living space I mean he has his bedroom up there"
[02:03.600 --> 02:06.840]  Val: yeah he loves it man and I'm so thank you thank you how come that does not come through on here
[02:06.840 --> 02:09.600]  Val: how come they changed your words perverted and
Tim:  I don't know 
Val: you said he
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.840]  Val: talked to a guy Sabah is a woman she says she's looking directly 
Tim: I spoke with
[02:14.840 --> 02:23.480]  Tim: I spoke with a gentleman 
Val: in the FBI or DCFS the DSF 
Tim: DCFS 
Val: she says 
Tim: you know what
[02:23.480 --> 02:29.280]  Tim: no I spoke I spoke to a gentleman but I think there was a woman conferenced in
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.200]  Tim: but she didn't do any of the talking with the gentleman that did that most of
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.760]  Tim: the talking 
Val: so that's completely taken out of context your words 
Tim: I mean yeah I
[02:38.760 --> 02:42.960]  Tim: think so and they certainly didn't say they were gonna generate a report and I
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.200]  Tim: would have liked to have read the report 
Val: she's a man I'll show if you want to
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.840]  Val: I'll send it to you man it is outrageously bizarre like our lawyer we
[02:51.840 --> 02:55.440]  Val: got a lawyer that's fucking expensive man for this and you look at this he's
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.560]  Val: done this 10,000 times at this district you've never seen anything like this
[02:59.560 --> 03:03.360]  Tim: I'll say I will take from the limited experience I've had I mean in New York I've
[03:03.360 --> 03:12.160]  Tim: made obviously I've made arrests and whatnot and the circumstances surrounding
[03:12.600 --> 03:17.320]  Tim: children in those situations were horrendous and nothing was done and in those
[03:17.320 --> 03:25.160]  Tim: circumstances I've made referrals I called I called an agent out of Los
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.720]  Tim: Angeles and an agent out of Houston that I know that deals with this sort of stuff
[03:29.720 --> 03:36.200]  Tim: and they asked if you would be okay if I forwarded you there forwarded them your
[03:36.200 --> 03:42.040]  Tim: information they might be able to help
Val: Sure absolutely
Tim:  okay all right one guy's name is one
[03:42.120 --> 03:48.160]  Tim: guy's name is Kevin

Tim: all right I'll do that now and then yeah I wanted to call you I
[04:15.120 --> 04:18.760]  Tim: couldn't but and I do think some of that was taken out of context and I'd be
[04:18.760 --> 04:23.440]  Tim: happy to 
Val: you know how you could fix it you know what you do we need witness
[04:23.440 --> 04:26.880]  Val: statements so people that have been if that have seen Marie and I and M-[Redacted]
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.400]  Val: together and just saying that we're normal good people you know from what I've

[05:20.320 --> 05:24.520]  Val: these people at DCFS are so incompetent they can't see tell
[05:24.520 --> 05:31.680]  Val: when they're talking to a crazy bipolar woman 
Tim: yeah it sounds like they're not credible yeah
Val: it escalates because Steve
[05:31.720 --> 05:36.760]  Val: feeds her and all this comes from Steve and two friends of Steve's that say
[05:36.760 --> 05:43.120]  Val: that we're drug addicts from 2018 18 right 
Tim: yeah is he in France where is he
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.280]  Val: Steve is here he won't go anywhere close to Marie he's from Australia but he's
[05:47.280 --> 05:50.880]  Val: still here in Los Feliz he's like 20 minutes away you cannot leave her sight
[05:50.880 --> 05:55.280]  Val: he hasn't had a girlfriend in 10 years like look the basic gist he had a
[05:55.280 --> 06:00.040]  Val: aneurysm in his back which left him paralyzed from the waist down in 2004 he
[06:00.040 --> 06:05.040]  Val: has a catheter to go to the bathroom he the guy has he can't no erection he has
[06:05.040 --> 06:11.200]  Val: not had sex in over 14 years right so that that will erode someone's brain and
[06:11.200 --> 06:16.660]  Val: Marie has seen it escalate lately so what she did during coronavirus because
[06:16.660 --> 06:20.320]  Val: he got so scary for her that she decided I'm not gonna give M-[Redacted] back for the
[06:20.320 --> 06:23.400]  Val: next three months so I'm gonna keep him now because they don't have a custody
[06:23.400 --> 06:28.720]  Val: arrangement so she kept him for the last five months and she's scared a lot
[06:28.720 --> 06:33.000]  Tim: Yeah and that's common a lot of people around here have done that too you know 
Val: good and that's good it's good to
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.720]  Val: hear because she was terrified what's gonna happen and this is his retaliation
[06:36.720 --> 06:42.560]  Val: calling DCFS four times in a row four times and they come in here and then at
[06:42.560 --> 06:45.600]  Val: first like if you read the report you'll see everything's great for the first 14
[06:45.600 --> 06:49.680]  Val: pages and all of a sudden we're the worst people in the world and there 
Tim: alright
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.320]  Val: but if you could write a witness statement Tim that would and that would
[06:53.320 --> 06:56.920]  Val: be a clincher that would be so fucking valuable and helpful for us from coming
[06:56.920 --> 07:00.680]  Val: from you especially 
Tim: all right yeah I don't see a problem with it I had to
[07:00.680 --> 07:03.680]  Tim: bounce it off of my legal folks I mean it's already it's already my concern would
[07:03.680 --> 07:08.000]  Tim: be disclosing our relationship but I think that's already out there I don't
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.400]  Tim: think that I don't think it would be a huge issue okay let me also send
[07:13.400 --> 07:16.960]  Tim: your information to the to the agents out there right now and if you don't
[07:16.960 --> 07:20.200]  Tim: hear from them in the next couple of days circle back to me

[07:31.000 --> 07:37.000]  Marie: these people are not abusing the child
Val: yeah our relationship
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.600]  Val: doesn't matter as much as what your your perception of our the relationship is
