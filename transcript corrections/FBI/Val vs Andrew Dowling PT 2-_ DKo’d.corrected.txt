[00:00.000 --> 00:07.480]  Val: Say that again, but say again you you you I sorry I got write this down now because now you lost me
[00:07.480 --> 00:09.480]  Val: Hold on. Let me get a pen. Oh
[00:12.480 --> 00:14.480]  Val: There's the band-aids. Found 'em.
[00:24.640 --> 00:26.640]  Val: By the way, that's an old check of mine
[00:30.680 --> 00:34.040]  Val: Make people feel more comfortable when I say oh
[00:35.040 --> 00:38.520]  Val: Hold on. Let me just get a pen and piece of paper so I can write this down
[00:39.120 --> 00:41.640]  Val: So that way you don't think that I'm recording you [laughter]
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.240]  Val: All right, what do I say what do I say? I did I actually do have a pen and paper now you said ask him what?
[00:52.160 --> 00:57.800]  ??: So initially ask him like why can't you proactively take
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.800]  ??: Information from me?,
Val:okay, why can't you proactively pro does proactive have a hyphen?
[01:05.080 --> 01:10.000]  Overlaping: Proactively no retain retain information from me
[01:11.160 --> 01:15.080]  Val: Okay, I'll obtain obtain. Oh not retain
[01:16.680 --> 01:20.000]  Val: Well, you can retain it. No, you can retain anything
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.420]  Val: You know, anally you can retain a lot anal retentive information
[01:26.420 --> 01:31.420]  Val: Why can't you? 
???: anyway proactively you figure out how you want to phrase that okay?
[01:31.420 --> 01:36.260]  ??: And then if you tap the answers and doesn't give you a direct answer, okay?
[01:37.220 --> 01:39.220]  ??: ask him if
[01:42.860 --> 01:45.700]  ??: The information that he could receive from you
[01:46.300 --> 01:51.820]  ??: Have privileged information which tainted him off a case. 
Val: Oh
[01:52.460 --> 01:58.860]  Val: Okay, so any info he received for me could contain may contain
[01:59.900 --> 02:01.900]  Val: Privileged information
??: Privileged
[02:02.300 --> 02:04.300]  Val: That would take him off the case
[02:05.660 --> 02:09.500]  ??: Yeah, and then if he doesn't answer there say
[02:10.020 --> 02:16.620]  ??: Did information that you provided get him in trouble or did he just get himself in trouble on
[02:17.340 --> 02:18.860]  ??: the Russia stuff
[02:18.860 --> 02:20.860]  ??: Like
[02:21.180 --> 02:23.180]  ??: Like
[02:24.180 --> 02:30.700]  ??: Is it something that it's specific to you where like if you go and you give information to David
[02:30.780 --> 02:35.180]  ??: Is that obstruction gonna go to David or is that just sticking with Tim?
[02:36.380 --> 02:43.820]  ??: Because Tim misbehaved himself and fucked up somewhere along. 
Val: Oh, no Tim is saying if I give data to him to not to not to
[02:44.460 --> 02:50.260]  Val: Ko but to him it would be obstruction or if he asked asked me
??: So chances are Tim fucked up somewhere along the way and put himself in a corner
[02:55.300 --> 03:00.940] Val: Yeah, and I think that was by trusting me because the next thing everything's on the New York Times
[03:03.740 --> 03:07.740]  Val: Right, yeah, but David Ko is calling me back right now. Hold on. Let me turn on the word
[03:09.260 --> 03:11.260]  Val: Let me call you right back. Okay
??: Bye
[03:12.220 --> 03:14.220]  Val: Hello
[03:14.380 --> 03:16.380]  Val: David, what's up? What happened?
[03:16.780 --> 03:20.620]  Ko: Well, I told you I had a meeting. 
Val: Okay. I thought you were hanging up on me
[03:21.900 --> 03:26.380]  Ko: Now, sorry. Okay. Good. I told you when remember when I first called you I said hey
[03:26.380 --> 03:30.380]  Ko: I gotta go to meeting in five minutes and then 15 minutes later. I said, okay. I gotta go to the meeting
[03:30.620 --> 03:33.740]  Ko: Hey, what did I say? I'm like, dude, I told you I had to go to the meeting. What are you?
[03:34.140 --> 03:38.540]  Val: Sorry, I missed that five minutes thing. I didn't hear that one. Sorry. I just maybe the phone died
[03:38.620 --> 03:42.940]  Val: But uh, okay. Sorry. So what do you think?
[03:44.300 --> 03:49.580]  Ko: Um, like I said the stuff with Rick Cohen and Kurt Weldon, I mean
[03:51.020 --> 03:56.540]  Ko: I mean, I'll add the Kurt Weldon stuff in see if that interests anyone. 
Val: Um, I can get you a dossier
[03:57.340 --> 03:58.460]  Val: like a
[03:58.460 --> 04:01.260]  Val: Dossier like I'm sort of a so you understand it
[04:01.660 --> 04:07.740]  Val: Andrew, I think would be happy to provide one or maybe he's already got one like an outline of the basic gist of the whole story
[04:09.020 --> 04:11.260]  Val: And the players yeah, and the names and players involved
[04:12.300 --> 04:14.700]  Val: Okay, I'll do that. Let me write that down. Actually, hold on
[04:15.660 --> 04:22.300]  Val: Because otherwise I am gonna forget this. Okay, so uh dossier on Weldon and Russian thing
[04:22.540 --> 04:26.620]  Val: But that's separate from FSB guy in LA so it's two
[04:27.340 --> 04:28.860]  Ko: Okay
[04:28.860 --> 04:33.260]  Ko: Did you do you text me the FSB guy's name yet or 
Val: I have not no
[04:33.900 --> 04:35.900]  Val: Oh, I'm still writing this down dossier and Weldon
[04:36.860 --> 04:38.860]  Val: Okay, um
[04:39.900 --> 04:45.820]  Val: You know what could we use Signal from now on or I mean are you that secure with your with your iMessages?
[04:47.260 --> 04:54.060]  Ko: I mean, well, I don't have Signal when we can install signal on our work phone. I mean, I just buy a drop phone and use it
[04:54.140 --> 05:00.540]  Ko: But are you worried about people like hacking in and stealing stuff? 
Val: Yeah, you know, it's pretty
[05:01.100 --> 05:02.700]  Val: It
[05:02.700 --> 05:06.860]  Val: I mean if I can do it be someone else will do it to me, you know, so I'm pretty sure people
[05:07.740 --> 05:12.220]  Val: Uh, just iMessage. I don't know. I mean, it's encrypted end to end. So I don't know why maybe I'm just being
[05:12.780 --> 05:16.380]  Val: paranoid, but let me just check my text. So I I'll have it right here
[05:16.540 --> 05:18.620]  Val: It's better to tell it to you than to text it is what I mean
[05:19.340 --> 05:21.340]  Val: For that in-lessons Signal
[05:21.500 --> 05:23.500]  Val: Um, we think this woman's number
[05:24.460 --> 05:26.460]  Val: Um
[05:26.540 --> 05:28.860]  Val: Are you still in Houston in Houston?
[05:29.740 --> 05:31.740]  Ko: Mm-hmm. 
Val: Let me see this thing
[05:35.900 --> 05:37.900]  Val: Oh, here we go. Okay, um
[05:39.500 --> 05:45.180]  Val: This name is k r b o y a n. That's the family name
[05:46.300 --> 05:48.060]  Ko: Sorry [could you] say that name again
[05:48.060 --> 05:50.060]  Val: k r b
[05:51.340 --> 05:53.340]  Val: O y a n
[05:54.300 --> 05:56.300]  Ko: [Repeats name in phonetic alphabet]
[05:59.900 --> 06:06.060]  K Like uh Ko david Ko. Okay R like ricochet B like uh bonanza
[06:06.620 --> 06:12.860]  Val: O like orient Y like yandex A antelope N neuro
[06:15.180 --> 06:17.180]  Ko: Okay, sounds good. Is that last name?
[06:18.060 --> 06:22.780]  Val: Sorry, that's the last name. Yeah, that's a family name. Um the number
[06:23.340 --> 06:26.540]  Val: Wait, wait, uh, okay number four two four
[06:27.340 --> 06:31.900]  Val: Three four six four nine zero four. That's one of his main. That's his main number
[06:35.020 --> 06:39.900]  Val: Three four six four nine zed four
[06:42.940 --> 06:44.940]  Val: Oh, sorry, wait, wait, sorry, that's that's
[06:45.900 --> 06:49.900]  Val: Sorry, that's the wrong one. Sorry. It's eight seven zero across that out. That's a different number
[06:50.380 --> 06:52.380]  Val: Actually, I don't know what the hell is that number? Wait
[06:53.820 --> 06:55.820]  Val: Yeah, you know what keep that number. That's the second number
[06:56.540 --> 06:59.260]  Val: Try this. This is the other one. I think this is a fake. Um
[06:59.820 --> 07:03.180]  Val: This is an internet number though because it has a it's the eight seven zero
[07:03.980 --> 07:07.100]  Val: eight zero zero eight zero eight zero
[07:09.900 --> 07:13.260]  Val: Oh, yeah, yeah d o b, uh
[07:14.380 --> 07:20.460]  Val: January 13th 1983 first name Arman A r m a n
[07:23.580 --> 07:31.980]  Ko: Okay, so what is our FSB officer up to? 
Val: Yes. Why is he in LA? And why is he uh,
[07:32.940 --> 07:34.940]  Val: Why is he so close to me now?
[07:37.820 --> 07:39.820]  Val: And am I being paranoid
[07:39.820 --> 07:45.040]  Val: Because this woman she came into my life very strangely I hired a private investigator
[07:46.060 --> 07:51.340]  Val: And the private investigator, uh, really good guy worked under the police force for a long time
[07:51.340 --> 07:53.100]  Val: I might have told you this already
[07:53.100 --> 07:59.340]  Val: 30 years on the force and then deputy sheriff and then he was a detective for many of those years and
[08:00.220 --> 08:06.940]  Val: Um instead of going to politics and becoming a sheriff he went became p. I and he's a very renowned well-known p. I
[08:07.740 --> 08:09.740]  Val: He's introduced me to her
[08:09.900 --> 08:14.300]  Val: And said that she's very interested in these little cords. I have these things
[08:15.820 --> 08:17.020]  Val: I kind of
[08:17.100 --> 08:22.460]  Val: I don't make them, but I sort of have like a it's like a hobby. You know the OMG cords
[08:24.940 --> 08:28.620]  Ko: I can't say I do 
Val: oh come on. You're a hacker. I thought you're a hacker
[08:29.740 --> 08:33.020]  Ko: OMG card 
Val: code no cord OMG
[08:34.460 --> 08:38.940]  Val: Oh, uh, so a guy named is a really good hacker named MG
[08:40.860 --> 08:45.260]  Val: Um, you developed a really good demon seed is this sort of company he goes by demon seed
[08:45.980 --> 08:52.540]  Val: and he uh great really good with encryption actually that's how I got to know him in 2016 I I heard is uh
[08:53.340 --> 08:54.700]  um
[08:54.700 --> 08:59.420]  Val: He gave like a lecture on his encryption. They was developing for he's trying to get people into it
[08:59.420 --> 09:03.740]  Val: But he was pretty good. It was like a Signal before Signal or around the same time Signal. What's going on?
[09:04.300 --> 09:06.780]  Val: but was he was really good at making these sort of
[09:07.740 --> 09:10.700]  Val: So what do you call him like a USB killers or USB hacks?
[09:11.500 --> 09:16.780]  Val: So if someone comes over hey, David, can I can I use your uh charger to charge up my iPhone?
[09:16.860 --> 09:20.220]  Val: And you're like, oh, yeah, here you go and you give him one of the chargers the cords
[09:20.860 --> 09:24.540]  Val: And he plugs it in and the cord just sort of uh
[09:26.060 --> 09:28.060]  Val: It does a um, it doesn't acquisition
[09:28.620 --> 09:32.780]  Val: Immediately of all the data on your phone. Well, not all the data, but the high-value data
[09:33.420 --> 09:37.980]  Val: Important stuff and the best part about about it is that it's it's a web server
[09:38.620 --> 09:43.900]  Val: So you can log in to the damn cord and you can deliver payloads. You can do whatever, you know
[09:45.180 --> 09:51.180]  Ko: There's a USB cable that will automatically dump an entire phone. 
Val: Yeah. Yeah, it's cool, huh?
[09:51.820 --> 09:54.220]  Ko: It's actually well, it's interesting. I
[09:55.260 --> 09:57.260]  Ko: Based on what I
[09:57.980 --> 09:59.980]  Ko: know of most phones
[10:02.140 --> 10:06.060]  Ko: I would say that the claim sounds a little bit excessive. I mean, there's some stuff you can
[10:06.220 --> 10:10.540]  Val: Well, I'll tell you what come over come over to my house and charge your phone and I'll show you
Ko: Well I'd probably bring a dummy phone to charge it
[10:15.420 --> 10:19.180]  Val: It's a I know it's a joke. I'm saying I'll show you that I'll show you I'll do it
[10:19.180 --> 10:21.420]  Val: I'll show you a thing for it, but I have to
[10:22.460 --> 10:24.460]  Val: I have
[10:26.140 --> 10:31.420]  Val: Yes, yes, it's called uh because oh MG is the the guy's name and he just put it o in front of it
[10:31.500 --> 10:33.500]  Val: So it's like, oh my god, you know OMG
[10:34.460 --> 10:38.780]  Val: Yeah, but I have to tweak it because the way it's sort of sold
[10:39.420 --> 10:44.220]  Val: Honestly, it's there's some like, uh, it's a little like a miss uh miss not miss no
[10:44.220 --> 10:45.420]  Val: It's a miss uh
[10:45.420 --> 10:50.860]  Val: It's bad advertising because it sort of alludes to the fact that it will dump the whole fucking thing from the phone
[10:51.660 --> 10:57.820]  Val: But really when you get it and you're like, what is this you unbox it? It's really the opposite. It's for the computer
[10:58.780 --> 11:02.780]  Ko: So, uh, computer's a little different than a phone. That's what I'm saying
[11:03.260 --> 11:07.500]  Ko: Yeah, I know the claim that you can just plug a phone in and it'll dump everything
[11:07.740 --> 11:12.460]  Ko:But that's where I went there something I really I'm like, I really got a loot which
[11:13.100 --> 11:14.780]  Ko: Is possible
[11:14.780 --> 11:19.740]  Ko: I would I'll be very suspicious if it actually worked. 
Val: Well, that's what I'm telling you. That's where I come in
[11:20.780 --> 11:24.140]  Val: And I did my a little tweak on it. So I make it work like it's supposed to work
[11:24.220 --> 11:26.220]  Val: Look, I thought it was going to work
[11:26.220 --> 11:31.180]  Val: And it's not as hard as you think because uh one you always do is get by the passcode and remember
[11:31.180 --> 11:33.660]  Val: These are for Macs mostly and for iphone's
[11:34.380 --> 11:39.580]  Val: So the passcode once you can get past that it's easy because you just trick it into thinking it's an iphone
[11:40.220 --> 11:45.260]  Val: It's not that hard. It's if it thinks if it thinks it's itunes passcode, but sorry
[11:47.100 --> 11:50.780]  Ko: Again, like that's what I mean is like there's there's a lot of other steps that need to happen
[11:50.780 --> 11:55.660]  Ko: Like the passcode is the very first hurdle you have to right get past exactly
[11:56.780 --> 12:00.140]  Ko: Well, you what what idiot is gonna put their passcode in after they plug it into
[12:00.540 --> 12:02.540]  Val: No, no, no, no
[12:02.780 --> 12:08.700]  Val: Of course, but no, no what the thing is you nowadays you have to hit trust this computer or trust this phone, right?
[12:09.340 --> 12:09.820]  Ko: right
[12:09.820 --> 12:15.900]  Val: So if you can already if the if the if you can emulate emulate the itunes software
[12:16.220 --> 12:23.580]  Val: Okay, which is just itunes and it's already pretty public you can find that that it's you emulate that and so the
[12:24.060 --> 12:27.660]  Val: Computer believes that you've already accepted this handshake. This handshake has been
[12:29.500 --> 12:34.380]  Val: Stored in somewhere in a cookie somewhere in there or a token or whatever the fuck it sees they do
[12:35.180 --> 12:37.180]  Val: It's actually a token
[12:38.060 --> 12:42.220]  Val: Then it's then it's okay, then you can get bypass the passcode, you know
[12:43.020 --> 12:46.860]  Val: And what you can get from another payload called lock scream
[12:47.660 --> 12:49.900]  Val: But somebody developed a while ago is very good
[12:50.540 --> 12:56.140]  Val: Is you can get the actual passcode so it'll it'll give you the passcode it gets into that little
[12:56.700 --> 13:01.660]  Val: You know, what's that thing every iphone has it's like a it's like a it's just a little file. I can't remember name
Ko: Lock file
[13:02.620 --> 13:05.740]  Val: Yeah, I think there you go lock file. So you just basically gets a lock file
[13:06.460 --> 13:08.460]  Val: Which is why it's called lock scream, you know
[13:09.340 --> 13:15.100]  Val: And so you incorporate that is payload number one and then the second one you get the credentials with the
[13:15.660 --> 13:19.900]  Val: You know, what's beautiful is I don't have to write anything. You just copy paste other people's scripts. So
[13:20.700 --> 13:22.700]  Val: And there's 12 different
[13:22.700 --> 13:24.700]  Val: Slots and banks for payloads
[13:25.340 --> 13:27.340]  Val: It's really quite a cool thing
[13:27.580 --> 13:30.540]  Val: So anyway, I'm trying to I told this to my private investigator
[13:31.020 --> 13:36.140]  Val: He's like really I said, yeah, he's like, okay Val. You know what I got I'll tell you what I'll do
[13:36.700 --> 13:41.340]  Val: I'm gonna work for you guys and you don't have to pay me. I just want a one painting from Marie
[13:41.820 --> 13:46.540]  Val: You know, and I want you to hook me up with one of these cords and a phone
[13:47.260 --> 13:51.980]  Val: Uh, you know, you know the phones that what do you call them the you can I can with blue dirt via bluetooth
[13:52.060 --> 13:57.500]  Val: Or via the RFID chip or both I put my phone next to yours and it pulls all the data
[13:59.420 --> 14:01.420]  Val: What do you call that?
[14:01.580 --> 14:04.540]  Ko: Well, I mean to get that claim is also very
[14:05.260 --> 14:07.260]  Ko: Uh
[14:07.660 --> 14:13.420]  Ko: I've heard and I've seen some stuff, but it's not as simple as like I put my phone next to yours and it steals everything
[14:13.820 --> 14:18.060]  Val: Well, you then you are buddy you're you are out of the loop because I have seen those and they are
[14:18.620 --> 14:23.580]  Val: Available and they do work and funny enough the only the last time I saw it was my friend Sydney
[14:23.580 --> 14:27.980]  Val: It was getting divorced and her husband had that had that phone and he uh,
[14:28.540 --> 14:33.660]  Val: He pulled all her data out and it was really quite amazing and that was in 2015
[14:35.340 --> 14:38.460]  Val: But at that time it took 30 minutes, so he had to leave
[14:39.020 --> 14:41.100]  Val: His phone on top of hers for 30 minutes
[14:41.180 --> 14:43.660]  Val: So that was the only problem was getting that to happen for 30 minutes
[14:43.660 --> 14:49.740]  Val: But nowadays you don't have to have it on top of the other phone. It can be within about one the six half a foot radius
[14:50.780 --> 14:54.620]  Val: So that's why I suspect RFID is the new way it's going in not bluetooth
[14:55.260 --> 15:00.780]  Val: Because you know, that's the only you can bluetooth you can go you know pretty far, but RFID you've got to be right there, you know
[15:01.740 --> 15:06.140]  Val: Still it's a lot of there's still a lot of data to pull over um that channel
[15:08.220 --> 15:11.740]  Val: I mean that handshake you can't handle much. That's why they only send out like a couple numbers
[15:11.980 --> 15:16.780]  Val: You know, it's like call and response with something and then decrypt it on RFID
[15:17.580 --> 15:22.460]  Val: So that's why you can only get the numbers and you can get um the messages are too big
[15:23.100 --> 15:28.380]  Ko: You're not getting the full dump for the phone. Well, you're getting call logs or maybe messages or something
[15:28.620 --> 15:33.980]  Val: Well, no, no, that's the thing at first you're not getting the full dump, but then you can turn on the bluetooth
[15:34.460 --> 15:36.460]  Val: Okay, and from the bluetooth you'll get the full dump
[15:37.420 --> 15:43.020]  Val: So the malware will will do will have a two-step basically two prong attack
[15:44.140 --> 15:48.620]  Ko: How does it uh download the malware onto the victim phone 
Val: from the bluetooth connection
[15:49.660 --> 15:52.940]  Ko: But how does it initiate a bluetooth connection without a handshake?
[15:53.260 --> 15:57.980]  Val: Well, it's remember how you it's you know how like a vpn won't let you turn off the wi-fi
[15:58.380 --> 16:01.260]  Val: There's a little trick in in apple that just has that stupid
[16:01.420 --> 16:07.660]  Val: Some there's the bluetooth the vpn people figured out first. It's a little hack. It's not even a hack. It's just built into the code
[16:08.220 --> 16:10.220]  Val: um, so if you have a
[16:10.460 --> 16:13.820]  Val: Every time the user turns it off it goes the root turns it back on
[16:15.100 --> 16:20.540]  Val: So and you can do that for the for that toggle that button which means you can do it for every other toggle button
[16:21.820 --> 16:23.100]  Ko: Wait, so
[16:23.100 --> 16:26.300]  Ko: How does so there's a signal that sends to the victim phone?
[16:27.020 --> 16:28.620]  Ko: Victim phone
[16:28.620 --> 16:36.300]  Ko: Then accepts this bluetooth connection without validation.
Val: No. No. No. No the the signal the signal is sent through rfid chip
[16:36.780 --> 16:38.780]  Val: or for the rfid frequency
[16:39.180 --> 16:45.100]  Val: um, and there's a second frequency which is not rfid, but it's like ic or is uh our
[16:46.140 --> 16:49.020]  Val: There's a third one in there too. That's involved and those two
[16:49.740 --> 16:51.740]  Val: Uh
[16:51.740 --> 16:54.140]  Val: Shit, it's it's the credit card. What do credit cards use again?
Ko: NFC
[16:55.260 --> 16:58.700]  Val: Yes, nfc. You're right. nfc rfid and fc
[16:58.780 --> 17:01.500]  Val: So I think it's nfc that does the initial handshake. Sorry
[17:01.900 --> 17:04.300]  Val: Then rfid and then bluetooth
[17:04.380 --> 17:08.940]  Val: But at the end of the day it's always bluetooth that pulls the data because that is the fastest way to do it
[17:09.420 --> 17:12.460]  Val: And the way it tricks the into the authentication
[17:13.020 --> 17:17.980]  Val: Is that it deauths first everything around it and then reauth on the uh
[17:18.460 --> 17:22.940]  Val: On the up on the reauth. There's somehow is uh, I don't I'm not sure exactly
[17:23.100 --> 17:27.260]  Val: I'm like, I'm not a coder, but I can take a look at it and see what it is, but I don't know
[17:27.980 --> 17:30.220]  Val: Like that's where I can tell you I don't know but it just does it
[17:31.260 --> 17:35.100]  Val: And I think it has to do with the root if you if you can root it
[17:35.740 --> 17:37.740]  Val: um, you can
[17:38.860 --> 17:40.860]  Val: Via bluetooth
[17:40.860 --> 17:42.860]  Ko: [unintelligible] always on Android because uh, ios
[17:44.300 --> 17:46.300]  Val: Yeah, no
Ko: I dunno Val, you're trying some pretty wide claims here
[17:52.300 --> 17:57.500]  Val: Dude you got to get in the field more man. I'm telling you, Sydney would never use anything but an iphone
[17:57.820 --> 17:59.820]  Val: She's one of those people, you know
[17:59.980 --> 18:02.940]  Val: Um, since whatever whatever iphone's became a status symbol
[18:02.940 --> 18:06.780]  Val: She's she's one of those in the in the husband is a billionaire. So he has no
[18:07.340 --> 18:09.820]  Val: He has unlimited access to RND
[18:11.420 --> 18:13.420]  Ko: Okay, 
Val: so remember that too. Yeah
[18:14.940 --> 18:16.940]  Ko: I don't anyway, I don't know whatever
[18:17.820 --> 18:19.820]  Val: The reason I say that is because um
[18:20.300 --> 18:23.900]  Val: With unlimited access you can hire a team of hackers to do this for you
[18:23.900 --> 18:29.100]  Val: But he didn't need to do that you can you can buy one 
Ko: you realize that I I do pen testing like I
[18:29.980 --> 18:32.700]  Ko: Whatever it doesn't 
Val: no, no. I'm not tell me you do pen testing
[18:33.580 --> 18:39.420]  Ko: But whatever it is. 
Val: Tell me 
Ko: it's not it's not worth like trying to figure out like how this has worked
[18:40.140 --> 18:43.580]  Val: I'd like to know. No, I like the questions because you're making me think it's good
[18:43.820 --> 18:46.620]  Val: Usually I just do stuff by instinct and then
[18:49.980 --> 18:51.980]  Ko: "You gotta get in the field." Yeah, whatever man, what
[18:52.780 --> 18:58.300]  Ko: What i'm saying is like I think the claim that you're making might be conflated with other data that might also be present
[18:58.300 --> 19:00.780]  Ko: There might be a lot of other things that also have to happen
[19:01.340 --> 19:06.380]  Ko: In order for this thing to work. 
Val: Well, he's not gonna look. We're not getting we're not getting photos. That's not happening
[19:06.540 --> 19:09.020]  Val: All right, we're not getting photos and videos. We're getting messages
[19:09.420 --> 19:15.900]  Ko: You get a full full everything on the phone. 
Val: That's a clone. 
Ko: That's a lot. That's different a lot of information
[19:16.060 --> 19:21.980]  Val: Sorry, I misspoke. I misspoke. That's a that's a clone like a complete clone 
Ko: the reason why I know that that's not true
[19:21.980 --> 19:25.340]  Ko: Is because just based on data throughput alone
[19:26.060 --> 19:29.100]  Ko: Like you say you have a regular iPhone that's like 64 gigs
[19:29.580 --> 19:34.780]  Ko: You know like 64 gigs with the data just transfer that data alone
[19:35.180 --> 19:37.180]  Ko: Not via either type wirelessly
[19:37.500 --> 19:42.140]  Ko: I mean at best at best you're gonna get like 10 15 megabytes per second
[19:42.380 --> 19:45.580]  Ko: And that's if you're like burning through it and you're like phone to phone
[19:46.300 --> 19:50.700]  Ko: 10 to 15 megabytes per second think about that it takes forever to get 64 gigs
[19:51.180 --> 19:53.180]  Ko: So if you thought that someone's just gonna like
[19:53.340 --> 19:54.380]  Val: Oh
[19:54.380 --> 19:59.740]  KO: And I'm gonna grab everything that's what I mean. It's like yeah, 
Val: what if it's the wi-fi that's almost impossible
[19:59.900 --> 20:01.660]  Val: It must be the wi-fi
[20:01.660 --> 20:05.660]  Val: No, it's not it would be the wi-fi because if you can turn on the wi-fi and hotspot
[20:06.220 --> 20:09.420]  Val: Hotspot the phone. 
Ko: Yeah, but like the phone can't
[20:10.220 --> 20:15.020]  Ko: A phone doesn't have the native ability to transfer something wi-fi to wi-fi right like
[20:15.260 --> 20:18.220]  Ko: Think if you have that you have an iPhone right how many ways can you transfer data?
[20:18.460 --> 20:21.500]  Ko: You can airdrop it you can bluetooth it which is the same thing
[20:21.900 --> 20:27.740]  Ko: You can transfer via wi-fi, but it has to have a specific protocol that allows it to transfer that data. So like
[20:28.460 --> 20:30.460]  Ko: Anyway, 
Val: no, no
[20:31.340 --> 20:34.620]  Ko: But that's what I'm saying. It's like when you make this claim like oh, I have enough to hold on like
[20:34.700 --> 20:38.860]  Val: No, no, but it verifies if you what you just said was the missing the link
[20:39.420 --> 20:42.060]  Val: Because it just it verifies what I was telling you before it is
[20:42.620 --> 20:46.700]  Val: It has to be bluetooth because it is the airdrop the airdrop is the fastest way to do it
[20:46.780 --> 20:48.780]  Val: It's actually faster than wi-fi close differences
[20:49.260 --> 20:55.340]  Val: That's gotta be it 
Ko: airdropping something also has a bunch of other security protocols that hey, if someone's cracked it
[20:55.420 --> 20:59.020]  Ko: Maybe they have I mean there's always new things every day that I know I learned about
Val: Mm-hmm
[20:59.580 --> 21:01.580]  Ko: But it seems
[21:02.780 --> 21:07.740]  Ko: Here's the other thing is we get a lot of these claims and then we go look at it and it's fucking bullshit
[21:07.900 --> 21:09.900]  Ko: And then total bullshit where some
[21:10.460 --> 21:15.420]  Ko: Is just scamming other pretend hackers. 
Val: I'm not telling you something I heard from somebody. This isn't like a
[21:16.140 --> 21:19.340]  Val: Gossipy thing. I'm telling you something that I that I've seen and I know
[21:19.980 --> 21:23.180]  Val: You know, maybe I got scammed. Maybe someone pulled the wool over from my eyes or something
[21:23.260 --> 21:25.980]  Val: They use some other, you know, it's a good parlor trick. It's possible
[21:26.620 --> 21:29.820]  Val: But I don't I don't know. I'll just I look into it. I mean I will look at
[21:30.700 --> 21:32.700]  Ko: Here's the other thing too is like
[21:33.260 --> 21:38.700]  Ko: Like I am interested in this stuff and the reason is because you know, we need to keep abreast of like what's the latest hack
[21:38.700 --> 21:41.980]  Ko: What's the latest vulnerability and it's always changing but
[21:42.940 --> 21:45.500]  Ko: You're realistically like this type of information
[21:46.940 --> 21:51.660]  Ko: If from an investigative standpoint isn't valuable to us unless someone's using it to do something bad something illegal
[21:52.140 --> 21:54.700]  Ko: Like breaking into someone's phone is already illegal
[21:54.860 --> 21:59.500]  Ko: But you know, it's like if a proof of concept is you're just like a white hacker
[21:59.900 --> 22:03.580]  Ko: You're trying to find vulnerabilities. Yeah, they do it all the time. They publish white papers and
[22:04.140 --> 22:07.340]  Ko: You know, we read them and we go to you know, trainings on them and things like that
[22:07.740 --> 22:11.580]  Ko: But there's nothing illegal about that, right? So it's right while it's interesting. It's not
[22:12.540 --> 22:14.540]  Val: It's only illegal if you use it
[22:14.540 --> 22:18.300]  Val: And by the way, I'm just this is a side adage for the main story I was telling you
[22:18.300 --> 22:21.820]  Val: We just got stuck here because it's fun to talk shop for some for once in a while
[22:22.620 --> 22:28.940]  Val: But yeah, the main gist is that they wanted they they were interested in developing these things as a mass production kind of thing
[22:29.580 --> 22:33.420]  Val: so, um, I got called into this meeting and uh
[22:34.140 --> 22:40.060]  Val: And the lawyer was there. She wants to uh, either fund it. I wasn't quite sure what she wanted
[22:40.700 --> 22:42.700]  Val: Other than
Ko: [unintelligible] investigator's name?
[22:44.940 --> 22:51.100]  Val: Um, yeah, why he's a good guy. Okay. Yeah porter p o r t e r
[22:52.380 --> 22:58.700]  Val: Order that last name. Yes, uh, uh, john. I don't know if it's an h or an n. I think it's I think it's john with an h
[22:59.660 --> 23:01.660]  Val: But he's a he's a good dude
[23:01.660 --> 23:05.020]  Val: Yeah, he has he owned a uh, he was sorry. He's the the warden
[23:06.060 --> 23:08.300]  Val: He was the warden of a of a prison out here
[23:09.420 --> 23:12.700]  Val: After that for a while too. No, he's an interesting guy. Very clever
[23:13.660 --> 23:16.940]  Val: He's a former Los Angeles county sheriff's officer
[23:17.100 --> 23:20.060]  Val: Bakersfield Bakersfield deputy deputy sheriff
[23:20.780 --> 23:24.940]  Val: And there was a time when there was constables in california. Is that correct? There's a constable
[23:26.140 --> 23:32.540]  Val: And so back then he used to work in the constables office or something. I'm not exactly sure. I'll ask him. He's coming by today
[23:33.500 --> 23:34.780]  Val: um
[23:34.780 --> 23:37.500]  Val: And so he was interested. He knows nothing about technology
[23:38.220 --> 23:41.740]  Val: So he was very interested in this. He said val if you can actually deliver these things
[23:41.820 --> 23:45.180]  Val: I know a thousand people that will spend a thousand dollars right now. I'm like, really?
[23:45.980 --> 23:48.140]  Val: It's like, yeah, and like well, you can buy these online
[23:48.700 --> 23:54.540]  Val: I mean, if it was that there's that much of an audience for it. I mean, you think there'd be something. I'm like hotcakes in July
[23:55.420 --> 23:57.420]  Val: But they're not so
[23:57.580 --> 23:59.580]  Ko: Okay, so John Porter
[23:59.740 --> 24:05.980]  Ko: Uh, you said John Porter somehow introduced you to the lawyer, right? The Russian Armenian lawyer
[24:06.860 --> 24:09.100]  Val: No, yes, he introduced me to the lawyer. Yes
[24:10.060 --> 24:12.060]  Ko: Okay, and what's what's the lawyer's name?
[24:12.540 --> 24:14.540]  Val: The lawyer's name is Diana
[24:15.420 --> 24:16.620]  Val: Uh
[24:16.620 --> 24:18.620]  Val: with a really
[24:18.620 --> 24:21.020]  Val: I don't I don't know her last name actually. I never asked
[24:21.660 --> 24:27.980]  Val: But let me see but the because she says here in the text the first message I have from her is Diana
[24:28.700 --> 24:32.140]  Val: The second one is hey it's Val and here's my number blah blah. So it was the introduction
[24:32.700 --> 24:35.020]  Val: Text and she never put give me her last name, but I will ask
[24:35.740 --> 24:37.740]  Val: John today for the last name
[24:38.460 --> 24:40.540]  Ko: What's her phone number I guess
[24:41.420 --> 24:46.380]  Val: Um, again, I'm getting the same bullshit phone number. I'm getting a 310 400 4000
[24:48.380 --> 24:50.700]  Ko:Okay, 
Val: yeah, it's a fake number
[24:51.660 --> 24:59.020]  Val: She's somewhat of a prodigy. She was she skipped ahead and she went to college at USC at age 16
[24:59.740 --> 25:03.500]  Val: And in ninth grade they skipped her up a few classes three grades
[25:04.220 --> 25:06.860]  Val: And she was uh, she's a prodigy of some sort
[25:07.500 --> 25:09.500]  Val: Very
Ko: Diana went to USC
[25:10.780 --> 25:12.780]  Val: She's 31
[25:12.780 --> 25:15.900]  Val: Uh, that's another interesting thing. She was it was all international
[25:16.700 --> 25:22.140]  Val: Uh, kind of you know, when you're spying, what do you do? What are those courses called international?
[25:23.100 --> 25:24.700]  Val: communication is
[25:24.700 --> 25:26.700]  Val: You know the one every
Ko: So Diana is also a spy, is that?
[25:28.380 --> 25:33.100]  Val: No, no, I'm not I'm just saying that what I heard from her when we went to the meeting
[25:33.180 --> 25:35.180]  Val: She told us a bit of her about her life story
[25:35.420 --> 25:39.420]  Val: And um, it was actually John that brought up the she jumped ahead
[25:40.140 --> 25:45.660]  Val: She's a prodigy and then she's filled it in by saying that she studied international communication international relations. Thank you
[25:45.820 --> 25:48.060]  Val: And I'm the one that said, oh, that's what you know
[25:48.300 --> 25:51.180]  Val: All the CIA guys study first and she could laugh and he was haha
[25:51.500 --> 25:56.140]  Val: And she's actually I was approached by them and they wrote me a letter and I said, oh, can I see it?
[25:56.140 --> 25:58.140]  Val: And she did not show me the letter
[25:58.860 --> 26:03.820]  Val: Um asking me to work for them, but I said my real love was with the FBI. I really wanted to work with the FBI
[26:03.900 --> 26:08.140]  Val: I said, oh, that's interesting. And she said, yeah, but um, you know, I just went into law
[26:08.220 --> 26:11.180]  Val: because it was easier or something like I don't know. It's a weird story
[26:11.900 --> 26:12.940]  Val: so
[26:12.940 --> 26:15.020]  Val: Um, anyway, you asked I told you
[26:16.460 --> 26:18.460]  Val: That's all I I don't have a last name
[26:19.260 --> 26:21.660]  Ko: Diana, no last name
[26:22.540 --> 26:24.780]  Ko: 31 years old, went to USC number
[26:25.500 --> 26:27.500]  Ko: 310400 4000
[26:27.660 --> 26:28.860]  Val: Yeah
[26:28.860 --> 26:30.860]  Ko: introduces you to
[26:31.420 --> 26:33.020]  Ko: uh, Arman
[26:33.020 --> 26:35.020]  Ko: Krboyan?
[26:35.020 --> 26:40.060]  Val: Incorrect incorrect asks if I can help um ask if I can help her
[26:41.260 --> 26:43.260]  Val: um
[26:43.420 --> 26:47.660]  Val: But I don't can't tell you too much. I don't want to tell you too much here because I don't want to get you in trouble
[26:48.860 --> 26:55.020]  Val: So I was asked to help on a totally different thing because I believe this guy has some compromising
[26:55.660 --> 26:56.860]  Val: videos
[26:56.860 --> 27:00.380]  Val: of her, uh, you know doing uh things that people do
[27:01.260 --> 27:02.060]  Val: um
[27:02.060 --> 27:06.300]  Ko: And Krboyan has compromising videos of Diana. 
Val: Yeah
[27:07.180 --> 27:09.180]  Ko: okay
[27:09.260 --> 27:11.260]  Ko: Okay,

[27:52.860 --> 27:54.380]  Ko: Yeah, so
[27:54.380 --> 27:57.180]  Ko: But then she wants them to delete it. So she called you
[27:57.820 --> 28:01.660]  Val: No, no, she's not calling me. She's not calling me. No, I was introduced
[28:02.220 --> 28:08.380]  Val: For by Porter because Porter. Yeah, we went to meet him in a park where he was working a different case
[28:09.100 --> 28:11.100]  Val: He was protecting these this
[28:12.140 --> 28:14.860]  Val: Uh, a woman and her children in the park
[28:15.420 --> 28:17.420]  Val: um, some sort of gang thing
[28:18.220 --> 28:22.220]  Val: So it was a whole thing and then he said, you know what you guys why don't you come and have lunch with me
[28:22.540 --> 28:26.060]  Val: And my friend and you should really get know her because she's someone you should know, you know
[28:26.140 --> 28:29.100]  Val: And this is called networking. It's like, oh, thanks John. He's a funny guy
[28:29.420 --> 28:34.700]  Val: And you know, she's a criminal defense lawyer and she's very interested in these cords that you were telling me about
[28:34.860 --> 28:36.220]  Val: I said, oh, okay
[28:36.220 --> 28:39.580]  Val: So Marie and I go over there for lunch and she does not cook lunch
[28:39.980 --> 28:42.620]  Val: But she did give us coffee, but we were there for hours talking
[28:43.420 --> 28:49.020]  Val: And she was very interested in financing these cords, but I have to deliver a working cord very soon
[28:49.660 --> 28:52.380]  Val: And uh, then she told me what she wanted from me
[28:54.380 --> 28:56.380]  Val: Right
[28:58.460 --> 29:00.860]  Ko: Okay, which is to delete these
[29:01.420 --> 29:05.100]  Ko: But uh, of her that Krboyan has 
Val: videos. Yeah
[29:08.540 --> 29:10.540]  Ko: Okay, and
[29:10.540 --> 29:12.540]  Ko: So Krboyan is
[29:12.620 --> 29:16.700]  Ko: But she and she says he's an FSB officer. 
Val: She alluded to that
[29:17.500 --> 29:21.660]  Val: Yes, she did not again. I told you earlier. She did not come out and say FSB officer
[29:22.460 --> 29:24.460]  Ko: How did she
[29:25.340 --> 29:27.340]  Val: Um, because I asked
[29:28.060 --> 29:33.340]  Val: Um, when we spoke about because everything she said, um with the 16 phone calls
[29:33.980 --> 29:36.220]  Val: And I'm looking at everything. Oh, she's just your basic
[29:37.180 --> 29:39.980]  Val: Criminal defense attorney defending drug dealers, right?
[29:40.700 --> 29:46.060]  Val: But then the guys said she says that he doesn't use drugs and doesn't doesn't uh, he's not a drug dealer
[29:46.620 --> 29:51.420]  Val: And then I'm like, well, why would he have 16 phones? I said, oh and I just sort of sometimes I can't really control what I say
[29:51.660 --> 29:54.300]  Val: Like a Tourette's but I don't have Tourette's and I said, oh FSB
[29:55.100 --> 29:58.780]  Val: And then everyone sort of laughs and suddenly I was like, who's what's FSB?
[29:58.860 --> 30:01.900]  Val: Because he's a little too old to understand that they changed KGB to FSB
[30:02.620 --> 30:08.460]  Val: And then I'm like, oh, uh, and I started then she starts explaining, you know, she fills in my senses and then
[30:09.180 --> 30:11.180]  Val: Uh, she said something
[30:12.860 --> 30:14.860]  Val: That made it sort of click
[30:14.940 --> 30:16.940]  Val: With me that it was FSB
[30:17.100 --> 30:21.020]  Val: And it was something that she so there's a hacker named Ruslan, you know Ruslan

[30:34.700 --> 30:36.700]  Ko: You want me to hang up man? Like every time
[30:37.260 --> 30:42.140]  Ko: I can't know everything in the fucking world, man.
Val: I'm busting your balls. Relax. I'm busting your balls, man
[30:42.220 --> 30:45.500]  Ko: Like every time you know about OMG Cords, man, I don't know about fucking on
[30:45.580 --> 30:50.300]  Val: Ah, dude, I'm busting your balls. Relax. Relax. You don't have a partner to bust balls with it's fun
[30:51.260 --> 30:56.380]  Val: Yes, look, you got this guy Ruslan. He's a russian hacker and he's a pretty fucking good by the way
[30:56.380 --> 31:00.060]  Val: He's one of the best and he uh, I don't know exactly
[31:00.620 --> 31:05.900]  Val: I'll fan but if I get my computer pull it off. He was working. She was handling his case
[31:06.940 --> 31:08.780]  Val: and uh
[31:08.780 --> 31:10.140]  Val: Shit, where's my computer here?
[31:10.140 --> 31:13.580]  Val: If she was handling his case and she was working out a deal over he was going to hand himself
[31:14.380 --> 31:16.380]  Val: over to the FBI
[31:16.380 --> 31:19.740]  Val: And because this is your specialty. So that's what I'm telling you
[31:20.700 --> 31:22.700]  Val: and at the very last day
[31:23.420 --> 31:28.540]  Val: Uh, he's supposed to show up to court and turn himself in and get some sort of uh suspended sentence or something
[31:29.020 --> 31:30.460]  Val: some sort of deal
[31:30.460 --> 31:34.700]  Val: He got on it was well, we don't she didn't say for sure
[31:34.780 --> 31:39.260]  Val: It was a plane but he left the country and went to Kiev on that very same day
[31:39.900 --> 31:43.660]  Val: And everyone went to court and we're waiting for him for a while a long time
[31:44.540 --> 31:48.220]  Val: When he uh, I think called from a some either a plane or a boat or something
[31:48.460 --> 31:50.460]  Val: Somehow somehow he got to the Ukraine
