[00:00.000]  Val: But uh... I don't know maybe we just have a bad lawyer but I don't know that means being that made me think of you know because if you can get this thing just to go away drop whatever you can save us some money with this lawyer in the in the energy and misery I don't like lawyers
[00:18.880]  Ko: right uh... neither do I if that makes you feel any better
[00:21.440]  Val: it doesn't
Ko: I've had to deal with the fair amount of them unfortunately
[00:24.000]  Val: yeah it's no fun
[00:26.240]  Ko: I hear you man I am looking into a couple things uh... so uh... to answer your question uh... you said you wanted to talk to uh... your lawyer Mike
[00:38.400]  Val: yeah
[00:40.080]  Ko: what would it be that you'd want to tell them
[00:42.640]  Val: well I think it would be great to tell him that like he says that basically what we decided after speaking with you is that  and you know what I fucked up after so all my life I thought erroneous meant uh... arbitrary I guess erroneous means wrong, inaccurate so uh... so Saba's uh... this woman's testimony this ridiculous thing she put together uh... it's very bizarre as everyone is said including the judge
[01:10.120]  Ko: uh... you there
[01:11.240]  Val: yeah oh no can you hear me now? How about this?
[01:16.240]  Ko: uh... about the Saba's erroneous uh... report
[01:19.040]  Val: right right she's saying that now the erroneous uh... the fbis uh... report was erroneous. This is what he said and he we need so he needs uh... Tim and Jammy. and you since you spoke to uh... you know Tim and Jammy could I guess verify or vouch uh... is you are not the guy uh... you did not speak to Saba
[01:42.160]  Ko: Sorry this is a little bit maybe, I'm not sure it's my connection or
[01:46.400]  Val: I don't know
[01:47.400]  Ko: mine I'm driving so
[01:48.680]  Val: oh you're driving
[01:50.000]  Ko: uh... you were saying Tim and Jammy's
[01:54.600]  Val: yes so Tim so as we figured out last night uh... Tim never spoke to Saba, okay. So she wrote and she wrote down that she directly spoke to Tim. So that's a problem that's erroneous and that's it. That's it
[02:07.440]  Ko: I don't know if she did or not. I don't know if she talked to Tim. I know that i've never talked to him
[02:15.000]  Val: that you never... right you're the one that. right this is as long as you tell him you never speak spoke to any of these people that'd be great. uh... maybe ask him what you could, if there's what does he need what could he do to help to have this go away now. uh... and suss him out I mean you've spoken with more lawyers and I probably have. does this guy want money is this guy trying to drag this thing out to get more money
[02:36.560]  Val: or is he uh... a good lawyer I don't know what do you think uh... and then also like he's trying to call Tim and Tammy to get them to say we never spoke with Saba this is uh... someone made this shit up and had he done that I think this morning and Tim and Tammy had picked up the phone I don't think there'd be a case
[02:59.840]  Ko: Ok let me say this remember what we talked about at first was that we need to keep specifically my involvement
[03:09.320]  Val: and I haven't told anybody
[03:12.560]  Ko: and I didn't think you would but the thing is if I tell your lawyer, your lawyer is also under no obligation to not put my name everywhere and put in court documents that are publicly available and things like that. so that's what we have to be careful on how we want to address it uh... more than likely what I would do since he already talked to Tim. I may have Tim talk to him on my behalf or something like that or clarify something. because Tim's investigation is already what it is and there's articles written about it in New York Times or whatever right now. so there's nothing covert about what Tim's doing if I call him and I say hey my name is David and i've never talked to this lady Saba and he's gonna be like well who the hell are you I'll say well I'm the agent of houston and like well why is he talking, why are you talking about? and then he's like well you know it leads down a lot of
[04:03.400]  Val: of course
[04:04.400]  Ko: roads we don't want to go down
[04:05.800]  Val: I'm just going off the plateau we hit last night when he said give me the lawyer's number and perhaps you could call him if you come up with an idea so I thought this would be a good chance
[04:18.760]  Ko: uh... also I never got the lawyer's number either I didn't write it down but usually if he tells me I write it maybe I said it and
[04:26.600]  Ko: he kind of like
[04:27.320]  Val: oh no 
Ko: I never got it
[04:29.120]  Val: I texted it to you did you not receive the text yeah oh no
[04:33.320]  Ko: let me check my text I just picked my notes but I didn't see it but uh... I'll double check my text again
[04:39.880]  Val: yeah that would be a big problem if you're not getting these texts then they're going to somebody else and that's not good i've got you right here I'm talking to you now and i've texted it to uh... let me just double check two eight one two eight one four one four six two three three
[04:56.400]  Ko: yeah that's it
[04:57.400]  Val: okay good and by the way the uh... congratulations on congressional medal of bravery that's amazing it's very amazing
[05:08.920]  Ko: yeah unfortunately that's all out there yeah I know
[05:11.480]  Val: pretty cool though man pretty cool I felt a lot more confident when I read that very good top marks for you
[05:18.800]  Ko: that was something that we didn't really deserve to get we're just doing our job and there's lots of other people who did a lot more than I did I'll tell you that right now
[05:26.120]  Val: yeah well said good answer good answer um but yeah okay yeah please let me know
[05:33.760]  Ko: yeah I'll double check some stuff I'm still doing some things so like I said what I'll probably come up with is I'll have to find out what it is that we need to do to resolve the court situation which unfortunately is not an easy list just from my, I don't know, the day of digging around and trying to figure things out uh... it's not going to be something that's going to be resolved overnight
[05:56.280]  Val: I know
[05:57.280]  Ko: I can only be honest with you right I can't promise you the world if I can't give it to you
[06:02.680]  Val: sure and I appreciate that
[06:05.800]  Ko: and uh... so right now I'm looking at things trying to figure out what uh... what our best get so to speak
[06:13.720]  Val: did you know, did you know there's no due process in this court system this this dependency court in this dcv
[06:20.400]  Ko: yeah it's a civil process which is different than a criminal process uh... so criminal processes you know it's beyond a reasonable doubt and that's the standard for conviction civil court cases it's uh... preponderance of the evidence I believe so
[06:35.040]  Val: well but there was no evidence. you can go now you can actually go in with pure hearsay and this is what the lawyer just just prove to us pure hearsay the neighbors can go say yes uh... you know uh... these guys are these guys are shaving chipmunks every you know, that's what they do they shave chipmunks and they sell the hair. and then there's no proof for evidence but they have to accept that as fact. the judge has to accept it as fact. or as true
[06:58.800]  Ko: I don't think, well I don't think they have to accept it as fact but, the standard for evidence is a lot looser I know what you mean. in other words it just doesn't have to believe that that's true because obviously you've got all sorts like unfortunately like I said i've dealt with this before. you know crazy ex-spouses claim all sorts of stupid shit
[07:17.320]  Ko: and luckily for the most part uh... we can kind of cut through some of the bullshit but but what we'll talk about on Wednesday is just trying to figure out if there's you know anything else that we should know about you know when we go and talk to them because I don't want to look like a chapped ass if you know if we put our neck out on the line and say hey you know this is this is we know that Val guy and he's not a serial killer and turns out you know okay I got 10 chopped up kids in the back truck you know
[07:45.240]  Val: yeah yeah I got you of course yeah
[07:48.120]  Ko: so uh but that's why on on Wednesday we're gonna talk a little bit more depth about that about what you can tell us because you know the thing the other reason I uh is Marie room right now
[07:57.960]  Val: uh yes
[07:59.960]  Ko: okay can she hear me? uh Marie can you hear
[08:03.160]  Marie: hi yes I'm gonna half asleep
Val: sorry she's half asleep though
[08:06.040]  Val: it's been like we were up all night we're just about to go to bed now and take a nap but I'll go for a cigarette can you can you give me I can go I'll go first you're right here hold on I'll just give me a minute let me go outside
[08:18.840]  Val: Do you have a lighter uh Marie? okay hold on one second oh the sunlight not good. oh man. okay let me take you off speaker. uh how do I do that? uh speaker speaker... damn uh that's not a speaker. can you hear me? are you on speaker? you're still on speaker. 
[08:58.680]  Ko: I'm still here 
Val: yeah I saw I don't know how to take you off out speaker now on the
[09:02.120]  Val: stupid phone. oh I'll get there, I'll get there, okay well I just want to do this right. um don't want to risk anyone hearing me talk to you either.
[09:12.200]  Ko: yeah of course
[09:17.240]  Val: ah there we go okay here we go how's that? what you better yeah further okay. oh okay what. I'm sure sure well to be to be to be honest with you I, we talk about everything I mean I know she knows every every inch of my life, and I know every inch of her life and it becomes familiarity breeds contempt as you know.
[09:59.880]  Val: so
Fed: [Unheard]
[10:10.040]  Val: yeah sure
Fed: [Unheard]
[10:20.120]  Val: you you're right and I should have told you sorry I should have told you that
[10:25.000]  Val: and uh that's my bad that's my bad
Fed: [Unheard]
[10:35.560]  Val: yeah
Fed: [Unheard]
[10:41.800]  Val: that's what I figured yeah that's what I figured I'll have to give her a different story though um I'm really bad at lying to her I can lie really well to everyone else but not to her I so I have to figure out half-truth
[10:59.400]  yeah
Fed: [Unheard]
[11:07.000]  that'd be great
[11:19.400]  Ko: I'm gonna even give Marie my number as well
[11:36.840]  Ko: ...eliminate any mistrust between you and her.... 
Val: sure that's great that's very polite yes let's do that
[11:41.080]  Val: that's a good idea
Fed: [Unheard]
[11:49.880]  Val: understood completely yes
Fed: [Unheard]
[11:58.840]  Val: okay
Fed: [Unheard]
[12:03.640]  Val: yeah well
Fed: [Unheard]
[12:07.560]  Val: September 29th is the next hearing um there's gonna be an investigator assigned to our case and he's gonna investigate us. um they've already spoken with M-[Redacted] and M-[Redacted]e loves me and he keeps telling him how much they love me so that's the good news and then to Steve's chagrin he does not like to hear that at all um but it's really nice it was really nice to hear the psychiatrist say M-[Redacted] just loves Val um so that's really good and then and there's uh uh what else is there so the so the judge I can't see or talk to M-[Redacted] until I get special permission from the judge or the hearing that's pissing me off that's like horrible and the thing that's five weeks from now  I'm not allowed to speak because of the allegations I'm not allowed to speak to Marlowe or even see him on the court well Marie's allowed to see him three times a week I can't even see him I can't even talk to him on the phone
[13:02.680]  Val: I know I know it's not nice it's we're crying it was terrible it was just terrible
Ko: We'll do our best to see what we can do ... resolving that.
[13:29.160]  Val: and uh yeah she or he will deliver a report of some sort and uh the the report will go to the judge and then the hearing will be based on that report the next step yeah
[13:58.840]  Ko: okay
[14:03.400]  Val: sure right
Ko: Best bet is to work with the investigator to show responsible parents... report... nothing derogatory....
[14:24.840]  Val: yeah it is yeah it's exactly what they told what the our lawyer told the judge and but the judge I was so frustrated to hear the judge has to take that by law has to accept that report and that's and they must have known that Saba and the others must have known that which is why they made it so severe I mean I do you still do you mean to send I was I'm happy to send it to you but keep in mind it is ridiculous okay I just worry I'm gonna be judged by this report that's why I'm afraid to show it to anyone because it's so absurd um like like it's yeah it's it's yeah because you you seem like a clever guy and you have that clever look on your face I saw in that photo and I said to Marie "oh shit he's smart" [laughs] when I saw your photo I getting the medal and I saw versus well compared to the other guys the other three guys and I said the Marie oh shit "this guy's smart" yeah no no no no I can tell you no I can tell you are sorry but I just want you so you can you can read between the lines and you'll see that the you'll see I won't taint it for you by telling you anything but you'll see for yourself um I'll send you that anything else you'd like me to send you just let me know I have a surveillance tapes I have uh no sorry security camera tapes and I have recordings of everybody so everything that i've refuted everything in there it's 90% of the lies I can actually have documentary evidence to um to hand in which for some reason they would not accept today but uh yeah so I'll send you that if you need to need as well
[16:08.760]  Ko: okay
