[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Val: Hello? Hello? Uh, hello?
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Ko: Hello, this is David.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  Val: Uh, hello? Oh, let me just turn this off. Hello?
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Val: Uh, David, uh, David Ho?
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Ko: Uh, David Ko, yeah.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Val: Oh, Ko, the K, sorry.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  Val: Hold on, let me just turn this thing off.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  Val: Okay. Hi, how's it going?
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  Val: Uh, you're Tim's, uh, you're the FBI LA, right?
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  Ko: Right, right.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  Val: Okay, cool. Great. Um, so did Tim tell you what was going on?
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  Ko: Not much. He just said that, uh, he has some issues.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  Ko: And, um, we're like, we've done some stuff with other people.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  Ko: Um, and it sounds like some of the same issues
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  Ko: with, um, child care and things like that.
Val: Yeah. 
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  Ko: Um, so anyway, I'm going to get a little bit more
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Ko: information from you and see what we can do to help.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Val: Sure. Sure, absolutely.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  Val: Uh, so David, are you, um, are you like an attorney
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  Val: or with the FBI? What's your, what's your role?
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  Ko: No, I'm an agent just like Tim is.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  Val: Oh, a special agent. Okay. Cool.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  Val: Are you guys in the same, are you like, is there any difference
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  Val: or did I, you could tell me DC three?
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Ko: Uh, I'm sorry, say that one more time.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Val: Are you in DC three?
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  Ko: So he's, he's out in New York and I'm, well, I'm actually
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  Ko: based out of another office, but, uh, I'm working with the FBI LA.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  Ko: So, um, I'll actually be in LA, um, actually on Tuesday,
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  Ko: Tuesday night and then, um, 
Val: are you the agent from Houston?
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  Ko: Yeah. Yeah.
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.000]  Val: Okay. So what happened then?
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  Val: So Tim told me he got a call from you.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  Val: I didn't know that you were the agent Houston till just now.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  Val: And then you were interviewing him with a third party on the
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  Val: line and what woman named Sabah Hapta.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  Ko: I don't know anything about that.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Ko: Oh, wow. Okay.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Ko: He's talking about something else.
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  Ko: He didn't tell me anything about who's Shabah Hapta.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  Ko: Should I know what Shabah Hapta is?
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  Val: Uh, yeah, yeah. She's the evil DCS DCFS woman.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  Ko: Oh, okay.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  Ko: So I, I don't know who, so I know, I know there was some DCFS person.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  Ko: I didn't realize that.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  Ko: Okay.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  Ko: So Shabah Hapta is the DCFS agent.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  Val: Yeah.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  Val: Sabah.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  Val: It's a, it's S-A-B-A-H-A.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  Val: It's like hate, but with a B, H-A-B-T-E.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  Ko: Okay. S-A-B-A-H-A-B-T-E.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  Val: That's correct. Yeah.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  Val: She's with DCFS and she, um, well, look, I'll give you the quick version.
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.000]  Val: Um, my girlfriend Marie, which, um, uh, Jam, you know, Jammy, Jammy Tam?
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  Ko: I can't, can't say I do. Who's jammy tam?
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  Val: Uh, he's also agent out in New York, SDNY.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  Ko: Oh, that's right.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Val: Yeah.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Ko: So I, I've heard of the name. I actually have never talked to jammy.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  Ko: I talked with Tim just once.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Val: Oh, okay. Well, they're both, they're all good people.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  Val: And Carmen, you probably, you probably don't know Carmen either.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  Val: But, you know, I've been working with them on, they told you what I've been doing, right?
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  Ko: Right. Some stuff in Deutsche Bank?
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.000]  Val: Yes. There you go.
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  Val: Deutsche Bank.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  Ko: Uh-huh.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Val: Just, you know, catching the bad guys basically.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  Val: Um, so, and they did a favor for me a while ago where, uh, Marie and her son, uh, M
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  Val: who's 8 years old. Um, they need to get their--
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  Val: Well, see, Marie's going through this very contentious divorce.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  Val: Um, the ex-husband's not a good guy kind of divorce, you know.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  Val: And, uh, and, uh, so she needed to divorce him.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  Val: And she, the only way she could was to get off his visa.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Val: Um, and he tried everything he could to not allow that to happen.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  Val: But fortunately Jammy and Tim and Carmen made it happen.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  Val: So she, she got off his visa.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  Val: She has her own visa with M on it.
[03:43.000 --> 03:50.000]  Val: Um, but, uh, now that divorce proceedings has started, have started, he has escalated
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Val: dramatically, dramatically so.
[03:52.000 --> 04:01.000]  Val: Um, including his escalation, now the short version is he's launched a full on attack
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  Val: on myself as the boyfriend.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  Val: And Marie obviously is the, uh, is the ex-wife.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  Val: He's the kind of guy that would rather see the world burn than lose Marie's attention.
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  Val: Does that make sense?
[04:15.000 --> 04:16.000]  Val: You know the types?
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  Ko: Sure.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  Val: Okay.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Ko: Unfortunately, I know a couple, but.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  Ko: You know how it is.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  Val: Yeah, I do.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  Val: I do.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  Val: It's unfortunate, especially when, uh, especially here in this case, because there's an eight
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  Val: year old, like he, the sort of person doesn't, uh, put the child first.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  Val: His needs first.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  Val: And then the child, right? M.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  Val: So I keep saying the child, like he's like, I'm just saying, but it's M.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  Val: He's an eight year old.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  Val: So it puts.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  Ko: I mean, he's Marie's child.
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  Val: Yeah.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  Ko: No matter how old he is, he's always going to be Marie's child.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Ko: I get you.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  Val: Exactly.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Val: I don't know, but I, I come from, and my, my language has gotten colder as I've talked
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  Val: with lawyers.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  Val: Cause now I say the child.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  Val: It's, you know, it's very terrible.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  Val: But, um, anyway.
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  Val: So, uh, M, uh, in, uh, you had, you see his, his, he has a problem.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  Val: Um, not only has he gone, the reason he's gone mad is 11 years ago.
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  Val: He had a spinal aneurysm, which left him paralyzed for about a year.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  Val: And Marie was married to him at the time and nursed him back to health.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  Val: He was able to walk again, but he did not regain all his functions.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  Val: So, uh, his bladder, his stomach, all this stuff.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  Val: He has to use a catheter, et cetera, et cetera.
[05:24.000 --> 05:31.000]  Val: Um, and of course the impotent, and that's one of the poor guys, you know, for 10 years
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  Val: can't have sex or have a hard on.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  Val: So, uh, oh, Marie's here by the Marie.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  Val: This is cat, er
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  Val: Mr. Ho.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  Val: Ko.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  Val: David Ko.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  Val: Okay.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Marie: Hello.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  Marie: Thank you for calling on a Sunday night.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  Val: Yeah.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Val: Marie's here, is it okay.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  Val: Is it okay.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  Val: if she listens.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  Ko: Sure.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  Ko: Sure.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  Ko: No problem at all.
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  Val: Okay.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  Marie: Thank you.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  Val: Thanks.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Val: Uh, so, um, 16 years.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  Val: Sorry.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  Val: 16 years, he says.
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  Val: And, uh, so when she, uh, they've been separated for a while because he would not allow a divorce.
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  Val: Um, but his brain and like his body has deteriorated, but so is the brain.
[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  Val: I mean, if you can imagine 16 years without any, I guess, sexual release or, uh, friendship.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  Val: He hasn't had a girlfriend also in 16 years.
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  Val: So you can, this is the type of person I'm telling you about.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  Val: So you know this type, right?
[06:21.000 --> 06:22.000]  Val: Not even a girlfriend.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  Val: So the obsession with Marie is very, very severe.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  Val: And, um, uh, so M and Marie's and I both noticed that is the deterioration has escalated
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  Val: dramatically.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  Val: So, so Marie took it upon herself to not, they've had a, not a shared custody agreement, but
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  Val: since they're married, they've had a, um, verbal agreement where Marie pretty much has
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  Val: M, I'd say 75 to 80% of the time and Steve sees him on the weekends.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  Val: But at this point, Marie decided that she could not trust him alone with M.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  Val: So she kept him when COVID started.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  Val: She said, I'm going to keep him.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  Val: I mean, I've got him for school and we can sit here and we can talk to him.
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  Val: And cause he changed a little bit around February.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Val: We still don't know why M has.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Val: We don't know what's happened.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  Val: So Marie kept him and that escalated things even further for the divorce proceedings.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  Val: Right.
[07:12.000 --> 07:19.000]  Val: So fast forward till very recent, about a month ago, uh, we have, we're not very well liked
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  Val: in our, um, building area.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  Val: We live in the Brewery Artist Lofts.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  Val: It's, you know where the brewery is?
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  Ko: Yeah.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  Ko: I've heard of it, uh, kind of a nice, uh, kind of artsy place.
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  Val: Yeah.
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.000]  Val: Exactly.
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  Ko: Yeah.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  Val: Yeah.
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.000]  Ko Yeah. I've heard about it.
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.000]  Val: It's, it's a lot.
[Marie whispers indistinctly]
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.000]  Val: I know, I know.
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.000]  Val: Don't worry.
[07:40.000 --> 07:41.000]  Val: I'm going to explain.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  Val: I say we're not well liked here because the building management has been fighting us for
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  Val: some time because of, of another crazy incident.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  Val: Um, but we have to talk.
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.000]  Val: You see, I don't want to bore David with all the details of that, but it's just a whole
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  Val: another thing.
[07:55.000 --> 08:07.000]  Val: So there's a woman here named Patille, uh, S-A-A-J-T-I-A-N and she lives two doors down.
[08:07.000 --> 08:13.000]  Val: Now she recently moved into that, this flat and we didn't, we never heard of her or saw her
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  Val: but, uh, we thought she was harmless at first.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  Val: Just like typical normal art,
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  Val: Well, she's like a really bad artist.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  Val: She makes crystal jewelry just to get to the point.
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  Val: Like no one wants to buy a crystal jewelry.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  Val: Um, but M, he's eight years old and he's very inquisitive.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  Val: He's very talkative.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  Val: And he was like, Oh my God, crystal jewelry.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  Val: And she, she met him in the park and she talked to him and, um, convinced him to become her
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  Val: apprentice for crystal jewelry.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  Val: And remember this is COVID.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  Val: So everyone's living with each other for the last four months.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  Val: So everyone's going crazy.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  Val: You know, it's, uh, what's the word?
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  Val: Uh, you know, Jack Nicholson, the shining sort of worldwide.
[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  Ko: Yeah.
[08:50.000 --> 08:51.000]  Val: Cabin fever.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  Val: Cabin fever.
[08:52.000 --> 08:53.000]  Val: Yeah.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  Val: Cabin fever in the whole country and probably the world because everyone's living together.
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  Val: So, uh, we figured, wow.
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.000]  Val: Okay.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  Val: She's, she wants M to come to her place to do, to make crystal jewelry for two hours
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  Val: of the day.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  Val: And we're like, Oh, that's great idea for us.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  Val: We can finally be alone for two hours.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  Val: You know.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  Val: So, and we, so Serrat [sic], we think she's fairly sane.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  Val: And, uh, Marie goes to introduce herself and we talk about a housekeeper.
