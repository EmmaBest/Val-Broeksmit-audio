[00:00.000 --> 00:10.660]  Val: Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? 
Ko: Yep, I can hear you. 
Val: Okay, good.
[00:10.740 --> 00:15.660]  Val: Hold on a second. Yep, I got you. Let me just find a cigarette. That's the guy I was telling
[00:15.660 --> 00:24.240]  Val: you about. 
Ko: About what? Give me some context. 
Val: So, remember I called and told you about this
[00:24.240 --> 00:29.980]  Val: guy that, for instance, for a very long time has been doing this credit card scam, this
[00:29.980 --> 00:36.720]  Val: fraud thing he's been doing with people's, like, I'm not sure exactly how it works, but
[00:36.720 --> 00:40.720]  Val: remember I was like, I couldn't get his last name and I couldn't figure out his first name
[00:40.720 --> 00:46.880]  Val: either, but I just got it today, found my notes. He wants me to work for him again. But
[00:46.880 --> 00:57.700]  Val: of course, I said no again. But it's a scam where he adds credit card numbers to existing
[00:57.700 --> 01:04.100]  Val: accounts or dead accounts that still exist on paper somewhere. The people could have been
[01:04.100 --> 01:09.100]  Val: dead for years or canceled their accounts for years, but he still has the card and he charges
[01:09.100 --> 01:14.380]  Val: them, I don't know, $16 a month or he jacks it up to $32. And no one really does anything,
[01:14.380 --> 01:18.660]  Val: but the bank, it's something where the bank sees it and it's only when the bank spots it
[01:18.660 --> 01:23.400]  Val: does he stop the, close the card. But when people complain, he says, oh yes, I'm sorry,
[01:23.520 --> 01:27.080]  Val: we'll take it off right away. But then they never take it off. And generally people don't
[01:27.080 --> 01:36.920]  Val: notice $15, you know, scattered off through, with a no name, some, you know, ubiquitous thing
[01:36.920 --> 01:42.280]  Val: attached to it, like global systems, you know, something like that. That's the guy's name.
[01:42.280 --> 01:49.440]  Val: So he does $300,000 a month is at his peak, but I don't think he's doing that now. I think
[01:49.440 --> 01:53.580]  Val: he's doing less because he couldn't really, because numbers he was offering were like really
[01:53.580 --> 01:57.880]  Val: low for something like this anyway. So I figured he just wasn't trying to lowball people.
[01:57.880 --> 02:01.420]  Val: What? 
Ko: How do you know he was doing $300,000 a month?
[02:01.540 --> 02:06.640]  Val: Oh God, he came in here and like, because he wanted Marie to paint something for him,
[02:06.680 --> 02:12.240]  Val: I remember. And that's how we got started on his thing. It was, he started just going,
[02:12.380 --> 02:17.420]  Val: man, he's like one of those people that will speak for an hour straight and you'll try to
[02:17.420 --> 02:21.240]  Val: get something into the conversation, but he'll just like talk over you and get, because he
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.100]  Val: wants to direct the whole conversation for himself. He doesn't realize that you're exasperated
[02:25.100 --> 02:30.320]  Val: after 45 minutes and you want him to leave. He doesn't pick up on that. One of those types,
[02:30.580 --> 02:37.980]  Val: you know? So that's how I learned, because he did that to me for about, I mean, 45 minutes,
[02:38.040 --> 02:41.860]  Val: I would be lucky if I got out 45 minutes. It was closer to two hours.
[02:44.100 --> 02:48.500]  Ko: Okay. So, and so he obviously lives in LA, I guess?
[02:48.500 --> 02:54.400]  Val: Yeah, he's in LA. He's somewhere out here. He's, uh, uh, they call him the baby mama.
[02:54.560 --> 03:00.980]  Val: So that means it's his girlfriend's. So his daughter's girlfriend is a woman named Brooke.
[03:00.980 --> 03:04.600]  Ko: All right. What about his daughter's girlfriend?
[03:04.860 --> 03:08.040]  Val: His baby mama. I just don't know baby mama. I always thought that was the other, I don't
[03:08.040 --> 03:14.460]  Val: really know the lingo, but his girlfriend, his wife, sorry, no, his daughter's wife, and
[03:14.460 --> 03:19.120]  Val: they're not married is, uh, I don't know what she is now, but she used to be some kind of
[03:19.120 --> 03:25.400]  Val: porn star or something. Her name is Brooke. Um, fuck. I want to say Brooke Barnes, but that's,
[03:25.460 --> 03:28.140]  Val: that's a New York times writer. Um,
[03:28.140 --> 03:29.280]  Ko: His wife
[03:29.780 --> 03:30.420]  Val: No, what?
[03:32.020 --> 03:34.580]  Ko: She's his daughter's wife, Brooke, is a porn star.
[03:34.580 --> 03:40.200]  Val: Uh, was a porn star, but now she's just sort of like a junkie that doesn't, uh, that's kind
[03:40.200 --> 03:44.040]  Val: of crazy. And she's talks a lot of strange things and says,
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.680]  Val: I never met her, but, uh, I got secondhand information from someone else that did meet
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.680]  Val: her. And she said a whole bunch of stuff about, about the, uh, she mentioned, mentioned the
[03:53.680 --> 03:58.840]  Val: Russian, uh, pay, pay loan, payday loaning thing. I don't know how good her information
[03:58.840 --> 04:02.720]  Val: is. Cause she's kind of, I mean, apparently what I've heard again, I'm shouldn't be quick
[04:02.720 --> 04:08.820]  Val: to judge, but, um, especially just someone else's judgment. So I don't know. I, uh, maybe
[04:08.820 --> 04:13.040]  Val: it's worth digging into later from my own, but she's the one that brought up the fact
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.880]  Val: that there was, uh, which verified my suspicions that it was something to do with the Russian
[04:17.880 --> 04:24.460]  Val: payday loaning scam that Andrew actually had figured out years ago. Um, and that's where
[04:24.460 --> 04:30.460]  Val: they, they'll call you and say, David, uh, or David Ko, you owe us, uh, $2,000 from
[04:30.460 --> 04:35.740]  Val: a copy machine or printer that you bought, um, in 1999 and you never paid it. Could you
[04:35.740 --> 04:40.340]  Val: please pay back this, uh, loan we gave you? And of course you never, you never did this
[04:40.340 --> 04:44.520]  Val: and it doesn't exist except for something that a guy created on paper. And then they
[04:44.520 --> 04:52.300]  Val: found that 65-70% of people will pay this, this, uh, phantom fine. Right. And that it's
[04:52.300 --> 04:56.860]  Val: a billion dollar business today in America. Um, and that's kind of why I put you in touch
[04:56.860 --> 05:00.700]  Val: with Andrew too, because he's one of his life's goals is to take down these, these people.
[05:01.000 --> 05:07.260]  Val: And I thought you guys would get along. Um, but it's interesting because, uh, if he's involved
[05:07.260 --> 05:13.340]  Val: with that, that makes it even bigger, an even bigger thing. I don't know if it's true, but
[05:13.340 --> 05:18.480]  Val: it's what I heard. Plus it's a problem for you because it's going to make, it's a political
[05:18.480 --> 05:24.660]  Val: at the end of the, of the, um, at the end of the rainbow. No, at the end of the, uh, what's
[05:24.660 --> 05:30.020]  Val: the word where you, the food chain is a politician. So that's not going to be good for you.
[05:31.280 --> 05:36.360]  Ko: Um, like an American politician. 
Val: Yes. American politician. So that's going to make you guys
[05:36.360 --> 05:42.780]  Val: look bad. Uh, Curt Weldon? Weldon? 
Ko: Curt Weldon. 
Val: Yeah. Curt Weldon? Okay. I think
[05:42.780 --> 05:47.680]  Val: Curt might be wrong. 
Ko: Curt Weldon is behind? 
Val: Curt might be, Curt might be wrong, but Weldon
[05:47.680 --> 05:52.820]  Val: is, is correct. The first name I'm not sure. I'll have to look, uh, ask Andrew or just look
[05:52.820 --> 06:01.220]  Val: online. 
Ko: What is his, uh, I don't know. 
Val: Oh dude, it's bad. He's a bad guy. So yeah. Like
[06:01.220 --> 06:10.460]  Ko: What is his participation in this payday loan or the credit card scheme? 
Val: Well, he, he brings
[06:10.460 --> 06:14.980]  Val: in, he gets permission, uh, permits, not permits. He gets, what's the word where you sort of
[06:14.980 --> 06:22.300]  Val: allow a Russian to work if you're sanctioned? Um, he gets sanctioned Russians. 
Ko: Like a visa?
Val: Yeah, not quite
[06:22.300 --> 06:26.700]  Val: a visa though. It's something else. He gets the, he's, they're allowed to work, uh, in the
[06:26.700 --> 06:36.380]  Val: States. Um, but only under the, uh, auspices of the, uh, like a, it gets a little convoluted
[06:36.380 --> 06:44.860]  Val: here because if you are on a, um, Indian territory, um, Indian, uh, reservation territory, you have
[06:44.860 --> 06:50.080]  Val: different laws. So you can operate on that reservation under those reservation laws. If
[06:50.080 --> 06:55.200]  Val: you can claim that you are, uh, uh, you know, American Indian or you can't say Indian anymore.
[06:55.280 --> 06:59.980]  Val: What's the word? Native American. Yes. Native American. So if you're Native American, uh, and
[06:59.980 --> 07:04.240]  Val: they somehow got Russians to be, you know, to say that the Russian Native American. So
[07:04.240 --> 07:12.180]  Val: that's what his thing, he also was able to go to Congress and lobby for, um, looser controls
[07:12.180 --> 07:19.160]  Val: to, for these companies. And he is so brazen. Like it's, it's, it's, he's got balls, like a
[07:19.160 --> 07:22.560]  Val: silver set of balls, man. He's brazen. He just goes right there in Congress and just
[07:22.560 --> 07:27.200]  Val: says, yes, we need less restrictions on payday loaning and payday lenders and in the, and
[07:27.200 --> 07:31.120]  Val: the weight in their, uh, the, or the opposite of the lending, the, the collection of it as
[07:31.120 --> 07:37.740]  Val: well. And, uh, basically just, uh, allowing violence, you know, and terrible things happen
[07:37.740 --> 07:43.500]  Val: to people. 
Ko: Um, so how do you know Weldon is behind all this? 
Val: Well, it's no secret. That's
[07:43.500 --> 07:50.240]  Val: not the secret. Uh, the secret is, is who is Weldon also infronting? Um, Weldon does,
[07:50.320 --> 07:56.280]  Val: does not, he's not shy about saying he's, you know, Andrew's the one to speak to. He's
[07:56.280 --> 08:03.200]  Val: the expert. I'll ask him. Um, but it's the, it's a Russian he's working in, in, in partnership
[08:03.200 --> 08:08.420]  Val: with a few, uh, really nasty Russians and the Russians are nasty because they can, they
[08:08.420 --> 08:14.500]  Val: come from a very specific crime family. Um, and there was a recent, um, there was a
[08:14.500 --> 08:19.380]  Val: recent, uh, there's a recent, uh, something in New York with this. Let me see. I wrote
[08:19.380 --> 08:26.020]  Val: it down, you know, I didn't want to forget this. So hold on. Um, where do I write it
[08:26.020 --> 08:32.140]  Val: down? You know what? I wasn't that prepared. So I just, I'll get it for you later. But I
[08:32.140 --> 08:36.420]  Val: wrote down the name of the family, the Russian family. Uh, it's not McGill, McGilluvocih [SP],
[08:36.420 --> 08:43.660]  Val: it's a different Russian, uh, gangster family that was very hooked into this, but, uh, Weldon
[08:43.660 --> 08:50.700]  Val: helps them make billions of dollars. And Weldon himself is now a billionaire, um, through
[08:50.700 --> 08:56.100]  Val: this, through this exact, uh, this thing. And the people that get hurt are just the everyday
[08:56.100 --> 09:01.080]  Val: people that don't want to get in trouble. And they believe that they owe someone a thousand
[09:01.080 --> 09:04.220]  Val: dollars. Cause they said, someone calls them on the phone and says, you owe us a thousand
[09:04.220 --> 09:06.280]  Val: dollars. They're like, Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. And we pay you back.
[09:06.420 --> 09:11.340]  Val: Um, and those that don't and say, no, I don't, um, I don't owe you money. They get,
[09:11.340 --> 09:17.040]  Val: um, stalked up to the point where they're like, what happened to Andrew and say, well,
[09:17.040 --> 09:21.800]  Val: we're going to come over and rape your wife. Shit like that. Right. And it gets bad. It's
[09:21.800 --> 09:24.080]  Val: really bad. And it's rampant.
[09:24.080 --> 09:30.680]  Ko: If I, if I, if I understand it correctly, um, Curt Weldon, who's a congressman, is he
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.540]  Ko: a, uh, past Representative?
[09:33.040 --> 09:38.360]  Val: Uh, do you have a computer? Hold on. Let me just load up my computer. Um, again,
[09:38.460 --> 09:41.160]  Val: Curt might not be the right, Curt could be the wrong name.
[09:41.200 --> 09:45.380]  Ko: Oh, I can look them. I can look them up later. If you don't, I'm just trying to get as many
[09:45.380 --> 09:50.040]  Ko: details as I can. 
Val: That's okay. I got my computer. So it's okay. It's working on her. I mean,
[09:50.040 --> 09:54.320]  Val: I'm, I'm looking at futures tanking right now, so I just don't want to go on this computer
[09:54.320 --> 09:59.440]  Val: cause I want to watch myself lose more money today. But hold on a second. It was a really
[09:59.440 --> 10:05.300]  Val: bad idea. The fucking Dow Jones just went through the roof. Um, right after Trump's COVID thing,
[10:05.380 --> 10:12.600]  Val: I thought it was going to go down. So that was bad. Um, let me see here. Weldon. Um, I have
[10:12.600 --> 10:20.380]  Val: notes on it. Welding and machine money laundering. Oh man. Oh, can you guys, if I, if I ever
[10:20.380 --> 10:27.280]  Val: do work for you guys, can you give me a new computer? 
Ko: I mean, we're, we're talking about
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.280]  a lot of you. 
Val: No, I'm sorry. Just the damn thing to shut down on me. Hold on. I need a
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.380]  Val: new battery. Um, yeah, there's a lot here. There's a lot here. Um, and it's, this is, I've,
[10:37.480 --> 10:41.780]  Val: I got the bottom of the food chain. Well, actually more of a middle manager guy. Uh, the bottom
[10:41.780 --> 10:46.260]  Val: of the food chain would be the guys that collect the money. But this, uh, the guy I just met,
[10:46.260 --> 10:52.960]  Val: um, well, not just met, but, uh, just, uh, in talking about now, Rick Cohen is a middle
[10:52.960 --> 11:01.440]  Val: manager. Um, so the higher up guys would be the Russian, um, the Russian sort of on paper,
[11:01.520 --> 11:04.840]  Val: the owners of the different companies. And it's all actually at the end of the day, it
[11:04.840 --> 11:09.860]  Val: all goes to one company, one, but it looks like there's a lot of different companies. So
[11:09.860 --> 11:15.520]  Val: they have a monopoly on it as well. And Weldon is the guy that allows this to happen. Weldon
[11:15.520 --> 11:22.280]  Val: and, and, so, is he Weldon in Congress? He might be Congressman. I think he's not a
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.700]  Val: Senator, but I could be wrong. Oh, Congressman Weldon, Florida. Curt, it is Curt. I was right.
[11:27.840 --> 11:35.880]  Val: Curt Weldon. Okay. Curt, Wayne Curtis Weldon. Yeah. Um, wait, there's a Senator, Senate
[11:35.880 --> 11:39.760]  Val: Judiciary Committee investigating Curt Weldon. Okay. So they started investigating him in
[11:39.760 --> 11:46.260]  Val: 2018, but that never went anywhere with an FBI probe. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, that's right.
[11:46.300 --> 11:50.860]  Val: And the Atlantic, I'm going to forward you this article from the Atlantic. It's good. Um,
[11:50.860 --> 11:58.660]  Val: but the guy you want to talk to, who's got extensive notes is Andrew. He is the man on this
[11:58.660 --> 12:03.520]  Val: and he, I don't know if he wants to tell you though. Um, but I will ask him. I'll ask him
[12:03.520 --> 12:11.460]  Val: first. Um, are you still there? Oh, I just got a missed call from you. What the hell? Oh, my phone
[12:11.460 --> 12:15.980]  Val: died. Shit. I'm talking to myself now. Hold on. I mean, why am I telling you to hold on? You're not
[12:15.980 --> 12:18.980]  Val: even on the phone? All right.
