[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Val: Right now. Good.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  Val: Okay. Yeah.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Val: Where are my phones?
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  Val: Uh-huh. Where am I?
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Val: Deployed.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Val: Deployed.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Val: Oh, why don't you take these out for a second?
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  Val: One, two, three.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  Val: I don't think I like these jeans.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Marie: They're really great.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  Val: Yeah, very.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  Marie: Yeah, especially when we run the run.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Val: Thank you, baby.
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  Val: You're kind of...
[00:43.000 --> 00:44.000]  Marie: Normal guy.
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  Val: Normal guy?
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  Val: Oh, good.
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.000]  Marie: Cool.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  Val: Cool style.
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.000]  Marie: Like, very stylish.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  Val: Nice.
[00:51.000 --> 00:52.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  Marie: I don't...
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  Val: I don't wear this stuff.
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  Marie: Huh?
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Val: Oh, my cigarette.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  Val: Oh, yeah, my check.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  Val: I need that mask.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  Marie: Okay.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  Val: And my cigarette loaves.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  Marie: What are you using now?
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  Val: Uh, lighter.
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  Val: Like a small one.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  Val: Oh, I think I have one in my bag, actually.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.000]  Val: Oh, perfect.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  Val: No, no, no. Wait, wait.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  Val:  This one scares me.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.000]  Val: No.
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.000]  Val: That's not good.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  Val: You can put that somewhere else.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  Val: One, two, three.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  Marie: Courage, huh?
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  Val: Do you want to give me back all the other stuff?
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.000]  Val: The, um...
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  Val: The bad greeners?
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  Val: Do you want that back?
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  Marie: Yeah, this one.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  Val: Okay.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.000]  ??: I can't do this one.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  Val: Okay.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  Val: Is it bad?
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.000]  Val: Yeah.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.000]  I can't do this.
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  I don't know if it's...
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  It's good.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  It's good?
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  Yeah.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's beautiful.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  You...
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  Val: I'm gonna picture you in your beauty.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  Val: Okay.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  Val: Wow.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.000]  Val: Okay.
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  Val: That's all.
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  Val: That's all.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  Marie: Um...
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Val: Maybe you can meet me if you come downstairs now.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  Val: Why don't you go by the building?
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  Val: Come here.
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.000]  Val: Come here.
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.000]  Val: No, no, in front of the building.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  Val: Just get in there.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  Val: Just...
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  Val: Just get your best friend in the building, please.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  Val: Why are you both doing that with your top?
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  Val: That would be that, no.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Val: This is not France in 1992.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Val: Both shoulders off.
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000]  Val: That's better.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  Val: That's what I'm talking about.
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  Val: What?
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  Val: I'm telling you to come down and meet me.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  Val: See, he's supposed to come down and meet me.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Val: You have to sneak me in, remember?
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  Val: He's heading down now.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  Val: Okay.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  Val: So, I'll say Marie wants me...
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  ???: Do you do well?
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  ???: Do you need to do well?
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  Val: Yes, I do.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  Val: I'm saying you just want to briefly meet him and say hi.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  Val: Sure.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  Marie: Okay.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  Marie: Sure.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  Val: I'll miss you beaucoup.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  ???: You want me to put some of this on this guy?
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.000]  ???: Yeah.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Marie: He's covered in this.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  ???: Okay.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Val: I'm going to tell him we're outside in the parking lot.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Val: You said it's cool to meet him, you can meet him.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Val: We're outside in the parking lot.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  Val: Drop off your air. [sic]
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Marie: Yeah, too.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  Val: Drop off your air.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Val: Red Mini, you can't do this here.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000]  Val: Where is it?
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  Marie: Here.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  Val: What's up?
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  Val: Okay.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  Val: Where is that?
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  Val: I'm worried.
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  Val: Aw, thank you.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  Val: Perfect.
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  Val: Oh, yes.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Val: Good idea, baby.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.000]  Marie: What?
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.000]  Val: That's a good one.
[05:04.000 --> 05:05.000]  Val: I like the pie.
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.000]  Val: Nice.
[05:06.000 --> 05:07.000]  Marie: Okay.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  Marie: You're not switching too much.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  Val: I am so hot.
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  Val: There will be air con inside.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.000]  Val: My story.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  Marie: It's a cool thing because it's like an internet joint.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  Val: Yeah?
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  Marie: Look.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  Marie: Super elegant.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  Marie: You look super cool.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  Val: Super stylish.
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  Val: Super fashionable.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Val: I like it.
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.000]  Marie: I need you.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  Val: It's the best thing.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  Val: Not as bad as me.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  Val: Do you want one of these or do you have another one?
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  Val: Yes, good.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  Val: Well done.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  Val: Perfect.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Val: Good, good, good.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  Val: That's what I'm talking about.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  Val: Smart.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Val: See you again.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  Marie: Thank you so much.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  Marie: Thank you.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  Val: I'll give myself a bit.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  Val: Pipe.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  Val: That's what you can't use.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  Marie: You have a band on your arm.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  Val: Is it your boyfriend?
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Val: Is it your husband?
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  Val: Is it your boyfriend?
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  Marie: No, no, no.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.000]  Val: Is it your controlling boyfriend?
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.000]  Marie: They looked at me.
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.000]  Marie: They were like...
[06:04.000 --> 06:05.000]  Val: Who?
[06:05.000 --> 06:06.000]  Marie: Nothing.
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.000]  Val: What was the thing?
[06:07.000 --> 06:08.000]  Val: You have a band.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.000]  Marie: I just...
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  Marie: I did not know what it was to me.
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  Val: Look, what did they...
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  Val: Is it like...
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  Marie: No, I was cooking and...
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.000]  Val: They mean anything about it?
[06:14.000 --> 06:15.000]  Marie: No, no.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  Marie: They just looked at me and looked at me and looked at me.
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.000]  Val: Okay.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.000]  Val: Hello.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.000]  Val: How's my hair?
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  Marie: It's okay.
[06:24.000 --> 06:25.000]  Val: What's it?
[06:25.000 --> 06:26.000]  Val: It's okay.
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.000]  Val: Don't worry about it.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  Val: It just makes my hair look a little stupid.
[06:29.000 --> 06:30.000]  Val: It's okay.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  Val: It's weird.
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  Val: It's okay?
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  Marie: We need some sun.
[06:33.000 --> 06:34.000]  Val: I know.
[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000]  Val: We need some sunglasses.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  Marie: Oh my God, yeah.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  Val: Maybe we can do that today.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Val: Oh, can you make appointments at the Apple Store for us?
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  Val: Soon after your...
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  Val: Your thing, we can go directly to the Apple Store.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  Val: You get a new pair of glasses.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  Val: We can go directly to the Apple Store.
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.000]  Val: You get a new phone.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  Marie: So we're not being hacked by everybody.
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  Val: Yes, you do, because you're hacked by everybody.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  Val: Okay.
[06:57.000 --> 06:58.000]  Marie: No, but in your ear.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  Val: Oh, yeah?
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  Val: Did you get them?
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Val: I don't...
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Marie: I'm sorry.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  Val: What are you doing?
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Marie: No, but they're in there.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.000]  Val: Oh, okay.
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  Marie: I know, it's annoying, but...
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  Val: Not helpful.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  Val: It's really loud.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  Val: It's really, really super loud, baby.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  Val: I'm sorry.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Val: You just can't blow my ears like that.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  Val: All right, so where are the plans today?
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  Val: Today's plans.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.000]  Val: Okay.
[07:25.000 --> 07:26.000]  Val: You're gonna do this.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  Val: See how long it goes.
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  Val: You might pick me up.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.000]  Val: You might not.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  Val: So I'll take Uber and then go to...
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  Val: Oh, shit.
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  Val: I left it inside.
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.000]  Val: Yeah, I need my keys.
[07:41.000 --> 07:42.000]  Val: Oh, there's the Fanta.
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  Val: The pineapple Fanta?
[07:43.000 --> 07:44.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  Val: Ah.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  Val: Wonderful.
[07:46.000 --> 07:47.000]  Val: Thank you.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  Val: Perfect.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  Val: One, two, three.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  Val: I got it.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  Marie: Do you have to go?
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.000]  Val: Yeah, well, he's gonna come.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  Val: All right?
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  Val: I told him Red Mini, you can't miss us.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.000]  Marie: Good night.
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  Val: Yeah, just leave it here.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  Val: Yeah.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  Val: Put on the hazards.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  Val: Put the hazards on.
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  Val: Nice.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  Val: Lock it, yeah.

[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  Val: It's going right now.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  Val: What about this back?
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.000]  Val: See the back?
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  Val: It sticks out?

[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  Marie: I got it.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  Val: Oh, careful.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Val: Remember to shake on my back.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.000]  Val: Thank you.

[09:28.000 --> 09:29.000]  Val: Thanks.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  Val: How's it going?
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  Val: Good, good.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  Val: Boeing.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  Val: Is that your name, is that it?
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  Val: Like the...
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.000]  Val: Oh, where's my mask?
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  Val: Yeah.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  Val: The company, right?
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  Fed: Look at it.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  Val: Do your parents...
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  Fed: Is that the one staff that comes down?
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  Val: Oh, my God.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  Val: There was some, but not for LA.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  Fed: Okay.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  Val: Really weird.
[09:48.000 --> 09:49.000]  Val: So easy.
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.000]  Cool.
[09:50.000 --> 09:51.000]  Yeah.
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.000]  Fed: Yeah, it was part of our strategy.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.000]  Fed: Lightened up a little bit.
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  Val: Sorry I'm late, though.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  Fed: Oh, come on.
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.000]  Val: It's like LA.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  Val: You're from here.
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.000]  Val: It's...
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.000]  Val: You're not from here.
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.000]  Fed: No, no, no.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  Fed: Not me.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  Fed: Not from here.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  Fed: We're going to get you a visitor, guys.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  Fed: What?
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  Fed: Is there a visitor?
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  Fed: Come on in, sir.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  Val: I have a photo of it.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  Fed: I need a physical ID, unless you guys are okay with that.
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  Val: This is actually my fault because I lost my drivers license a few days ago.
[10:16.000 --> 10:17.000]  Val: I don't know where it is.
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  Val: It's in a book.
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.000]  Val: It's on my bookshelf.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  Fed: It's okay.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  Val: You guys are okay with that?
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  Fed: Okay.
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  Fed: Just go ahead and place all your items here in the bin for me.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  Fed: Okay, now do you want to let you know you were entering the federal facility?
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  Fed: Okay, we are conducting.
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  Fed: Sir, one second.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  Fed: Okay, listen to me.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  Fed: I'm not done with this inspection, okay?
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  Fed: We are inspecting for weapons and explosives.
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  Fed: You have nothing like that on you?
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.000]  Val: No, I don't.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  Fed: You can still carry any tools, knives, pepper spray, nothing like that?
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Fed: Let's do your belt off.
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.000]  Val: Oh, great.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  Fed: I'm going to have you take off your coat.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  Val: Sure.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  Val: Sure.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  Val: No problem.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  You guys, what are you doing?
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  Fed: Do you have any electronics?
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  Val: No, they're all in here.
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  Fed: Okay, put them separately, boss.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  Fed: Separately from your bag.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  Fed: You can put them right here with your document.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  Fed: Put your document here.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  Fed: Put your document right there, okay?
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  Val: I'll leave them in the bag.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  Val: You want to take them out of there?
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  Fed: Take them out of there.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  Val: I brought some stuff.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  Val: He said don't bring anything.
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.000]  Val: I thought you marked it.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.000]  Val: I thought you were just being polite.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  Val: I brought a little stuff for you.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  Fed: Okay.

[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  Val: Oh, wait.
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  Val: I don't mean anything.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  Fed: Yeah, everything out of your pocket.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  Fed: Okay?
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  Fed: So you have nothing with your name on it?
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  Val: I do.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  Fed: Okay.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  Val: But I'll show it to you on my phone.

[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  Val: And I think she – uh, Chinese.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  Fed: I apologize, I think because of like pandemic stuff, usually they're coming here.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  Val: Oh, oh really? In the break room upstairs to the floor?
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  Fed: Yeah, you know what there is.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  Val: Oh, perfect, okay.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  Fed: Good morning gentlemen.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Fed: Good morning. We have a visitor here, and he's from...
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000]  Fed: Thank you.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  Fed: Cheers.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  Fed: Can you see my partner?
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  Val: Thanks.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Val: You guys want to do this again?
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Val: Oh, okay.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  Val: Thank you.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  Fed: Thank you.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  Val: Cool.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  Val: Does everyone make fun?
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  Fed: Um...
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  Val: Really, huh?
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  Fed: Yeah, usually you'll feel comfortable here because of your game console.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  Val: Oh, dang it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  Fed: You know, I get to meet about a fun man or two different people.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  Val: I remember this tenth floor.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Val: I handed my stuff, we go to another one over there.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Fed: Exactly, same thing.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  Fed: And then what we just handled over there used to be handled on the tenth floor.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  Val: Yeah.
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  Val: So that girl's no longer working here?
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  Val: It's a floor lady?
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  Fed: Oh, it's always changing.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  Val: She's so nice.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  Val: Super nice.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  Fed: Oh, that could be it.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  Val: Yeah.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  Val: Still not.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  Val: Are you guys there?
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  Val: So, some of you are special agents?
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  Fed: Yep.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  Val: And you are DC3?
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  Fed: Uh, I'm not...
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  Fed: I'm not in LA
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  Fed: You know, I'm not part of their...
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  Fed: Their hierarchy.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  Fed: No, I'm not.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  Val: It's not the...
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  Val: It's the general hierarchy.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  Val: In New York.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  Val: It's everything but Russia.
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  Fed: DC3.
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  Fed: Yeah, so it usually doesn't work in the same way.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  Val: Oh.
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Fed: So different...
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  Fed: Different to a lot of different things.
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.000]  Val: Cool.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  Val: Oh, there.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.000]  Val: I see what you're saying.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  Fed: You remember that?
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  Val: I do.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  Val: Oh, wait.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  Val: It's my natural that's supposed to...
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  Fed: Oh, right.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  Val: Thanks.
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  Val: Okay.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  What's going to do with it?
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  Fed: I wonder if we're all thoroughly...
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Fed: What's going on?
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  Val: Did you get a chance to...
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  Val: There were four lights.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  Val: Clever.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  Val: I liked it.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.000]  Val: I liked it.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Fed: I'd love you get the reference.
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  Val: Oh, I got it.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.000]  Val: I got it.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  Fed: That's what it is.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  Fed: That's supposed to make a random number.
[17:03.000 --> 17:04.000]  Val: Yeah, that's good.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  Fed: One, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  Val: I was surprised you spelled out four, though.
[17:08.000 --> 17:09.000]  Fed: Oh, I think...
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  Fed: Because I never thought we'd take anything.
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  Val: Oh, it was?
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  Val: Oh, okay.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  Fed: Yeah, that's how it is.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  Val: It's good.
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  Val: Well, you read the call of Winston.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  Val: It's from Winston.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  Val: And he's being tortured.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.000]  Fed: Right.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  Val: Writing in the floor.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  Val: It's a portless floor.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  Val: A two-plus-two-plus-four.
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.000]  Fed: Interesting.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  Fed: No.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Fed: That's the one where there are five lights.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  Fed: And he makes Picard saying that there are four.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  Fed: He makes them say that there are five lights.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  Val: I know, but that's...
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  Val: But it's taken from 1984?
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  Fed: Yes.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  Right after the record.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Right after the record.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  Val: Nice.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  Val: Cool.
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  Fed: He probably grabbed all the stuff.
[17:59.000 --> 18:00.000]  Fed: Okay.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  Fed: Is there another room?
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  Val: I think I might have a bigger...
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  Fed: No, it's okay.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  I like the other side of the room.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  Sorry, this side.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  That's a big one.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  It's gonna be good.
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.000]  Hang on there.
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.000]  Val: I don't...
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  Val: Cool.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  Fed: Well, this is...
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  Fed: This is Patty
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  Val: Patty?
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  Val: How do you do it?
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  Val: Nice to meet you.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  Fed: Can I take a hand?
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.000]  Fed: Yeah, I know, it's a...
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  Val: The virtual way, right?
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  Fed: Sure, sure.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  Val: Patty, are you from Houston as well?
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  Fed: No.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.000]  Val: LA?
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  Val: From LA.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  Val: Okay.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  Fed: How do you like your coffee?
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Val: Lots of milk sugar.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  Fed: Milk sugar?
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  Val: Yes, please.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  Val: Can I take off my mask?
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  Fed: Good.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  Val: We casual here?
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  Fed: Okay.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  Fed: I have one.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  Fed: Take it really.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Val: I just can't get the frogs up my glasses.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  Val: You do it with your fogger.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  Fed: I know.
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  Val: You know?
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  Fed: I've got some people with a mask.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.000]  Fed: I've got a clear one.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  Fed: Yeah, like a face shield.
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  Fed: But now they're saying,
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.000]  oh, are you in the mask?
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  Right, right.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  It's very, really.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Val: Do you need both of them?
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Fed: I don't know.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  There are some.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  There are some.
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  Yeah, that's a lot.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  I can't wait for the last time.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  I'm just gonna leave this.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  Val: Believe it or not,
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  Val: Russia just did the other vaccine yesterday.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  Fed: Of course they did.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  Fed: I saw that.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  Fed: I saw that too, right?
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  Val: It's propaganda.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  Val: It's propaganda.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  Fed: Oh, I'm sure.
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  Fed: I saw that too.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  Fed: Thank you.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  Val: Good to [unintelligible]
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  Val: So I'm so excited to hear what this is about.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  Fed: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  Val: I don't think I can take it anymore.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  Val: It's like so thrilling.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  Val: I've got four guesses.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  Val: Can I guess?
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  Fed: Sure, you can guess it.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  Val: Okay.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  Val: Does it have to do...
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  Val: I don't think it has to do with things.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  Fed: It [unintelligible] have to tell you.
[20:01.000 --> 20:02.000]  Fed: If that makes you feel any better.
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.000]  Val: That's not helpful.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  Val: All right, let me see if I can read you.
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  Val: Based on my guesses.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  Val: I don't think it's related to banking.
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.000]  Val: Okay.
[20:12.000 --> 20:13.000]  Val: I think it's related to hacking.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  Val: I think it has something to do with Emma.
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  Val: How am I?
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  Val: I'm close?
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  Val: I couldn't read you.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  Val: Well, no, you're getting a different one the first time.
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.000]  Val: Your eyes went to the right.
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.000]  Val: Usually, eyes up to the right,
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  Val: you're creating something.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Val: Down to the left, it acts as a memory.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  Fed: So, everything I've read and studied about that
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  Fed: is actually bullshit.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  Val: It is bullshit.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  Val: You've got to know the person who does that.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  Val: It is true.
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  Val: You've got to get a baseline with the person first.
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Fed: Whatever.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  Val: It's not like global.
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.000]  Fed: Because you think about it,
[20:41.000 --> 20:42.000]  Fed: if that was true.
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  Val: Yeah.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  Fed: Every poker tournament
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  Fed: you'd be able to find out immediately
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.000]  Fed: who's blocking the business.
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.000]  Val: That's true.
[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  Val: That's true.
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.000]  Fed: Because detection of deception
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  Fed: is incredibly difficult, unfortunately.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  Val: Well, do you think so?
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.000]  Val: I think it's pretty easy.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Fed: It's a research issue.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  Val: If you know how you are deceptive,
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  Val: then you will know how someone else is deceptive.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  Val: Except for certain type.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  Fed: I would have to see.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  ???: Lisa?
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  Fed: So, there's different types of liars, too.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  Fed: There's Machiavellian liars,
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Fed: who will lie just a lot.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  Fed: They'll lie because that's just what they did
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  Fed: every single day of their life.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  Val: Trump.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  Fed: Then, on the other side of the world,
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  Fed: there's what you can call the Catholic school
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  Fed: boy or girl.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  Fed: They've grown up with a fear of lying,
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  Fed: where anytime they lie,
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  Fed: they're like,
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  Fed: I just said that my name is David.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  Fed: What does he think my name is?
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.000]  Val: The shame associated with guilt.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  Fed: So, those are, yeah, exactly.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  Fed: So, those are two very distinctly different types of liars
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  Fed: who lie very distinctly different.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  Fed: So, for example, the Machiavellian liars
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  Fed: is harder to detect on the line.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  Val: Because it's constant lines.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  Val: There's no baseline.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  Fed: And the opposite would be the Catholic school boy or girl
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  Fed: is harder to detect because they're constantly triggering.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  Fed: Well, they honestly think that they're lying about something
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  Fed: even when they're not.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  Val: What about the sort of desperate liars
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  Val: that are trying to stay alive?
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  Fed: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  Fed: That's what it means.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  Fed: I've read a couple books on it,
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  Fed: and we've taken a couple classes.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  Val: Yeah, that's what I was curious about in your classes.
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.000]  Val: Do they teach that?
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Val: Do they teach at Quantico or something?
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Fed: Like, that's a thing that I'm sure
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  Fed: can be used to see someone's life
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  Fed: and there are things that we'll do.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  Fed: And there's things that I do
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Fed: as part of my normal daily life.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  Val: Yeah.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  Val: Well, what I do is I ask you questions.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  I know. I'll ask you what's your name
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.000]  Val: when it's your birthday,
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  Val: because they're at low.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Val: And then I'll see how you react to the honest question.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Val: And then I'll ask you something I know you don't know,
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  Val: and I'll see how you react to that.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  Val: And that's how I establish a baseline.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  Val: That's my method, though.
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.000]  Fed: That's a good thing.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  Val: That's how I do it.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.000]  Val: What about you?
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  Fed: You had polygraph, huh?
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Val: What's a polygraph?
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  Val: No, no, I'm not.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  Val: I'm not.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  Val: I'm never taking polygraph.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  Val: I would like to if you guys [hook me up]
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  Val: It'd be fun.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  Val: But no, I just, you know,
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  Val: I like people.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  Val: Well, actually, I hate people, but I like...
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  Val: I love and I hate people,
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.000]  Val: but I like to study things.
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.000]  Val: I don't know.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  Fed: Very cool.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Fed: Very cool.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  Fed: That was nice of you,
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  Fed:we're going to bring you down here.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  Yeah.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  [unintelligible]
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Fed: if you want to head back out or something.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  Val: I'm sorry?
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  Fed: Do you have to give her a call?
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  Val: No, it's just got to work at one.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  Val: So she said,
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  Val: is you going to go out
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  Val: and just to write this letter
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  Val: to the judge?
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  Val: Yeah.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  Val: Well, he got screwed over by his fucking lawyer.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  Val: It's got to be Mike Kretzmer.
[23:13.000 --> 23:14.000]  Fed: Mm-hmm.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  Val: He went so far as to...
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  Val: He emailed Jim and Tammy
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  Val: saying,
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  Val: I am Val's counsel.
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.000]  Val: I am Val's attorney.
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  Fed: Interesting.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  Fed: Yeah, because I saw your text this morning.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  Val: I saw that.
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  Fed: You know, he said he'd like to represent you,
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  Fed: but he's not, so...
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  Val: Yeah, we had to fire him.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  Val: Yeah.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  Val: He was very condescending.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  Val: And there's something really wrong.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Val: You see, I thought it was in L.A.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  Val: I mean, it's like a mafia.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  Val: They know each other
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  Val: and they do whatever
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  Val: the other person says.
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  Val: It's very disturbing.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  Val: They don't want to mess it up however you want,
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  Val: but you have to have it.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  Val: That's perfect.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  Val: Thank you.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  Val: Wonderful.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.000]  All Val: right.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  Val: Well, I tried to guess what this is all about.
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  Val: It's
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  Val: nothing to do with banking.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  Fed: Okay.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  Val: And I think that's something to do with hacking.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  Val: And her name is Emma.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  Fed: Oh, look.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  Fed: I think I got the honor of being here.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  Fed: Well, I mean, to the third guess.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  Okay.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  No, no, no.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  Fed: Another guest.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  Interesting.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  Fed: Who's the third guest?
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  Fed: I thought you said he had four guesses.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  Val: No, no, no.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Okay.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  Yes.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  Oh, there's a guest.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  Val: It's a match.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  Val: It's a match.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  Val: It's a problem.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  Fed: Cool.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Fed: I guess, so,
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  Fed: what we're here for is mainly to see
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  Fed: how we can help you, right?
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  Fed: Because we need to find out.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  Fed: So, you and I have talked,
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Fed: I've talked with Patty and Bowling
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  Fed: about it lately,
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  Fed: but you should probably
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  Fed: rehash a little bit about
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Fed: what the situation is right now,
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  Fed: how the hearing went,
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.000]  Fed: and everything else.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  Fed: Just make sure that we're all on the same page.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Fed: Because like I told you,
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  Fed: like, if we are going to be able to help,
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  Fed: we have to know how we can help
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  Fed: and how best to help you.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  Val: Okay.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  Fed: That way, we can go forward.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  Fed: But at the same time,
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  Fed: if you're going to help us,
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  Fed: you also have to know,
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  Fed: okay, well, is this going to be
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  Fed: dependent on something else?
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  Val: Right.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  Val: Well, that's why,
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  Val: why don't you just tell me
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  Val: first what you want.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  Val: And then I'll go from there.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Fed: Well, I mean,
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  Fed: the thing is like,
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  Fed: I'm not going to tell you
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  Fed: what exactly we want.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  Fed: I'm telling you that right now.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  Val: I've already told you,
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  Val: on the phone,
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  Val: I'm giving you my word,
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  Val: because you, Tim and Jami,
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  Val: recommended you.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  Val: I said,
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  Val: I'll help you if you need my help.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  Val: No matter what.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  Val: Even if it's,
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  Val: even if it's not anything related
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  Val: to you helping me,
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  Val: I will help you the best
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  Val: in my ability.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  Val: Okay.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  Val: Just because of Tim and Jami,
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  Val: because I take,
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  Val: their word is very,
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  Val: they carry a lot with me.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  Val: It goes far with me.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  Val: So I've already told you that,
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  Val: so I'll stick with that.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  Val: You don't have to worry about
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  Val: anything too transactional with me
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  Val: right now.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  Val: Okay.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  Val: If you guys are coming out here
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  Val: to help me,
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  Val: that's great.
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.000]  Fed: Okay.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  Val: I'll tell you,
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  Val: what do you need to know?
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  Val: The whole story from the beginning?
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  Fed: Yep.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000] Fed: [unintelligible]
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  Okay.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  Go.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  Um.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  Um.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  Val: I don't even know where to start
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  Fed: from the beginning.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  Uh.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  Okay.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  Val: So,
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  Val: you don't know my story though.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  It Val: doesn't really matter, does it?
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  Um.
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  Val: You can't even trust it.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  Val: You can't even trust it.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  Val: Oh, please don't read it.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  Val: David Enrich's article.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  Val: It's terrible.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  Val: Um.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  Val: Okay.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  Val: Marie and I met,
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  Val: uh,
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  Val: because I thought she was a spy for my mom,
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  Val: and I thought she was spying on me.
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  Val: So I,
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  Val: uh,
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  Val: confronted her,
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  Val: and she was,
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  Val: uh,
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.000]  Val: had a show in Australia
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  Val: doing,
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  Val: selling a bunch of,
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.000]  Val: uh,
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  Val: she had a personal,
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Val: like her first cool show in Adeline,
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  Val: I think,
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  Val: Or
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  Val: Sydney.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  Val: I don't remember.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  Val: So,
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  Val: um,
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  Val: she ends up,
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  Val: she knows my mother,
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  Val: because my father,
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  Val: committed suicide
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Val: you know that story, right?
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  Val: So he killed himself,
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  Val: and my mother needs something to do,
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  Val: after she,
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  Val: uh,
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  Val: robbed me and everyone else in the family
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  Val: of all our money.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  Val: Um,
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  Val: went to,
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  Val: back to,
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  Val: uh, art school in New York,
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  Val: and,
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  Val: uh,
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  Val: Marie was just about to leave her husband,
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  Val: and she went to art school in New York at the same time.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  Val: So my mom's like 64,
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Val: Marie was like 34 at the same time,
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  Val: but they hit it off,
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  Val: became friends.
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  Val: You know,
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  Val: Marie actually stayed on my mom's house,
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  Val: she knows my sisters,
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  Val: she did like cocaine with my mother,
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  Val: which is weird.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  Val: You could imagine,
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  Val: with stories,
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  Val: it's very weird.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  Val: Um,
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  Val: anyway,
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  Val: so,
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  Val: and not to incriminate me.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  Val: It's a joke,
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  Val: you guys say.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  Fed: Having coffee with friends.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  Val: Right, right.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  Val: So,
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  Val: um,
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  Val: and then we hit it off,
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  Val: and she came back to LA,
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  Val: and she lived in LA fortunately,
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  Val: and,
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  Val: uh,
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  Val: and David needed somebody to,
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  Val: um,
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  Val: and my mother's side was not talking to me,
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  Val: and at this point,
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  Val: I was still friends with David,
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  Val: David Enrich,
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  Val: and he needed someone in my mom's camp,
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  Val: and so I said,
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  Val: you know what,
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  Val: I think I got the perfect person,
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  Val: I'm gonna,
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  Val: I'm gonna flip her,
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  Val: and take her from my mom's side,
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  Val: bring her to our side,
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  Val: it's a good side of the force,
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  Val: right,
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.000]  Val: and I did,
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  Val: you know,
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  Val: and I did,
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  Val: and she became a source of the book,
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  Val: and she filled in David with
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  Val: all the blanks he,
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  Val: uh,
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  Val: was missing,
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  Val: and we moved in together,
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  Val: you know,
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  Val: all my life,
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  Val: I've been like a bachelor,
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  Val: you know,
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  Val: kind of spoiled brat,
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  Val: mostly too,
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  Val: and my dad,
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  Val: kind of financed my life,
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  so I,
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  I made music,
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  I had 36 albums in a single,
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  I had a lot of girlfriends,
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  I fucked around,
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  I went on tour,
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  I had fun,
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  you know,
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  and that all,
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  went to zero,
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  and it all stopped,
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  immediately,
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  and January 26, 2014,
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  and I learned,
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  I learned a lot since then,
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  a lot of things have changed for me,
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  and I've never dated a girl
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  with a kid,
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  and I was like,
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  you know what,
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  I really love her,
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  and I really like this kid,
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  so why the fuck not?
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  I mean,
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  my father,
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  my mom,
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  when I was a kid,
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  you know, when I was just Marlowe's age
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  and,
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  he's a good kid,
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  and it's not that,
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  I mean,
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  it's hard to raise a kid,
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  believe me,
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was gonna be,
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  you know,
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  especially when he's a good kid,
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  you know,
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  he's really happy,
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  but, you know,
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  and like,
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  Val: most of that's really from me.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  Fed: They say it's a much stronger love.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  Val: That you'll ever love,
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  yeah,
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  it's true,
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  it's true,
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  but I also have like,
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  I'm also not,
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  I mean,
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  I'm like the boyfriend,
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  so I mean,
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.000]  I'm the father figure,
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  as well,
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  but I guess I don't have the burden
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  that Marie has,
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  and that's,
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  like I could see hers,
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  she is really upset
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  over little things all the time.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  I'm like,
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  why are you getting so upset?
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  She'll "fuck you."
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  Anyway,
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  we,
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  we,
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  everything was sort of going fine.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  I got a bit depressed
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  when Pegi died,
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  a very close friend of mine
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  died January 1st.
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  And now,
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  Fed: Is it?
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  Val: No,
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  Val: it's 2019,
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  you know,
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  but,
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  that's another story.
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  It's a good story,
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  but a long story.
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  Neil Young,
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  his wife,
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  Peggy,
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  Neil Young is a real dickhead,
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  a real fucking asshole.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  When I was at the funeral,
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  he stood up there on stage,
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  it looked like he had won,
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  like Peggy had died,
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  and he got his girl,
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  his wife and daughter back,
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  who was,
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  he was,
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  this,
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  estranged from,
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.000]  and all the money that Pegi took in divorce,
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  and he said,
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.000]  there's like,
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.000]  I won,
[30:01.000 --> 30:02.000]  I got it all back.
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  I had to leave early,
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.000]  I don't know,
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  about what I said.
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.000]  The point of that story is
[30:09.000 --> 30:10.000]  because you need to know
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.000]  about Steve,
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  so Steve Toltz,
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  okay,
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  he's an Australian,
[30:14.000 --> 30:15.000]  and he is a writer.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  He won like a second prize
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.000]  in a beauty contest,
[30:18.000 --> 30:19.000]  you know,
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.000]  like a runner-up
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  for the Booker Prize,
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.000]  but not even
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.000]  win the Booker Prize,
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  and he only did it
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.000]  because his father
[30:25.000 --> 30:26.000]  is a very well-placed guy
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  in Sydney,
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.000]  and a very wealthy family
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  of lawyers,
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.000]  and they did
[30:32.000 --> 30:33.000]  whatever they could.
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.000]  So,
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  he's sort of like,
[30:35.000 --> 30:36.000]  and I don't say
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  it's just a little bit
[30:37.000 --> 30:38.000]  of the angry boyfriend,
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  he's kind of,
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  he's limited capacity,
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  he's running sort of like,
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  he's not the brightest guy around,
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  but he can fool you
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  into believing he is,
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  you know,
[30:47.000 --> 30:48.000]  and I think he did that
[30:48.000 --> 30:49.000]  to Marie for a long time,
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  and when she sort of caught on
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  to what was really happening,
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.000]  she left.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  But,
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  when I met her,
[30:55.000 --> 30:56.000]  he was still emailing her
[30:56.000 --> 30:57.000]  20, 30 times a day,
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.000]  texting her,
[30:58.000 --> 30:59.000]  sorry,
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.000]  the equivalent,
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  and she thought she
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.000]  had to respond,
[31:02.000 --> 31:03.000]  and I remember
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  being in a car in like,
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.000]  2018,
[31:05.000 --> 31:06.000]  I'm like,
[31:06.000 --> 31:07.000]  why are you responding to this?
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.000]  Why are you doing this?
[31:08.000 --> 31:09.000]  Like, every time he has
[31:09.000 --> 31:10.000]  an issue why do you have to
[31:10.000 --> 31:11.000]  say, oh, you're going to be fine,
[31:11.000 --> 31:12.000]  she's like,
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  I don't know,
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.000]  I just feel guilty if I don't.
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  I'm like,
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.000]  well, okay,
[31:16.000 --> 31:17.000]  we don't have to,
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  and then she was
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.000]  like, you're right,
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  I don't,
[31:20.000 --> 31:21.000]  and then she stopped,
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.000]  and that's when it all started.
[31:22.000 --> 31:23.000]  So,
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  he's a kind of guy,
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  I was telling Kim, [Tim? Ken?]
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.000]  would rather burn
[31:26.000 --> 31:27.000]  the world down
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.000]  than to
[31:28.000 --> 31:29.000]  allow her to leave him.
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  Okay,
[31:30.000 --> 31:31.000]  and I never met these
[31:31.000 --> 31:32.000]  types of people before.
[31:32.000 --> 31:33.000]  This is new to me,
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.000]  right?
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  Like,
[31:35.000 --> 31:36.000]  first of all,
[31:36.000 --> 31:37.000]  I'm dating a girl with a kid,
[31:37.000 --> 31:38.000]  and now there's a boyfriend,
[31:38.000 --> 31:39.000]  like,
[31:39.000 --> 31:40.000]  the kind you see in
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.000]  freaking television shows,
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  you know,
[31:42.000 --> 31:43.000]  it exists.
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  I didn't know.
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  I didn't know.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  I thought she was like,
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  I thought Marie was over exaggerating.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  I'm like,
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.000]  come on,
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.000]  can it be that obsessive?
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.000]  She shows me the texts.
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  I'm like,
[31:52.000 --> 31:53.000]  wow,
[31:53.000 --> 31:54.000]  you know,
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  you have to really be crazy.
[31:55.000 --> 31:56.000]  So again,
[31:56.000 --> 31:57.000]  the reason,
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.000]  what you don't know,
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  is that when they first met,
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  he was sort of normal.
[32:01.000 --> 32:03.000]  She was waiting for him to leave,
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.000]  but he stayed
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  and moved into her house.
[32:05.000 --> 32:06.000]  Then he got sick,
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  and aneurysm in his back.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  It did something to the spinal nerve,
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.000]  and L4,
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.000]  I don't know,
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  I'm not a physician,
[32:13.000 --> 32:14.000]  so I don't know exactly,
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  but it severed the nerve,
[32:16.000 --> 32:17.000]  pinched the nerve.
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  It was something where it paralyzed.
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.000]  Neck down,
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  fully paralyzed.
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  She,
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  Marie is such the type where,
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  she actually wrote a letter to
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  Sarkozy saying,
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  I need your help,
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  He's an Australian,
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  and he can't pay for his medical bills.
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  And Sarkozy fucking responded,
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  and said,
[32:35.000 --> 32:36.000]  okay.
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.000]  Yeah,
[32:37.000 --> 32:38.000]  Val: that's Marie.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  Fed: So Sarkozy actually paid for his bills?
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  Val: Sarkozy paid for his bills.
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.000]  Fed: Probably start to write
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  Fed: Sarkozy for health and planning.
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.000]  Val: Right?
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.000]  Val: Yeah,
[32:45.000 --> 32:46.000]  Val: what am I doing here
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.000]  when I could talk to Sarkozy?
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.000]  No.
[32:48.000 --> 32:49.000]  But
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  what's really weird
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  is that Steve's father
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  could have paid for it,
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  but they didn't,
[32:53.000 --> 32:54.000]  because they were that type of people.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  They can get it for free,
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  then they'll take it, right?
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  It doesn't matter that they're taking someone else's
[33:01.000 --> 33:02.000]  scholarship,
[33:02.000 --> 33:03.000]  someone else's
[33:03.000 --> 33:04.000]  fund for their thing,
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  they don't care.
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  So Marie nursed him back to health
[33:08.000 --> 33:09.000]  after a couple years,
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  and he could walk with him.
[33:10.000 --> 33:11.000]  Miracle,
[33:11.000 --> 33:12.000]  it was a 4% chance of walking,
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.000]  you walk.
[33:13.000 --> 33:14.000]  Oh no,
[33:14.000 --> 33:15.000]  sorry,
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.000]  not 4% chance.
[33:16.000 --> 33:17.000]  That was,
[33:17.000 --> 33:18.000]  that was having Marlowe's 4% chance.
[33:18.000 --> 33:19.000]  It was like a very low
[33:19.000 --> 33:20.000]  percent chance of walking,
[33:20.000 --> 33:21.000]  but he was up and walking.
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.000]  But
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  he would forever have to wear a catheter.
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  I think a colostomy bag,
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.000]  I'm not sure how long that lasted,
[33:27.000 --> 33:28.000]  but of course,
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  the guy,
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  no hard on,
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.000]  cannot get it up,
[33:31.000 --> 33:32.000]  no sex.
[33:32.000 --> 33:33.000]  So Marie
[33:33.000 --> 33:34.000]  just was in her,
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.000]  she's very loyal,
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  and she was 22,
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  when she met him,
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  very young and naive.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  So,
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  what am I doing?
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  I guess,
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  can't,
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  you know,
[33:43.000 --> 33:44.000]  I have to stick with this guy.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  You know,
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.000]  she did last as long as she could,
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.000]  and his mind
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  and body deteriorated further and further,
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  and then she just left.
[33:50.000 --> 33:51.000]  She couldn't take it much,
[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  she left.
[33:52.000 --> 33:53.000]  Now,
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.000]  between us,
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.000]  they separated in,
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.000]  I think 2013,
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  but for the lawyers,
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  it's 2018.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  Just so you know,
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  because she's,
[34:01.000 --> 34:02.000]  you know,
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.000]  for the,
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  you know,
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.000]  I don't know any about divorce either,
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.000]  but the lawyer said,
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.000]  let's just say 2018.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  Okay,
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  so I don't know.
[34:09.000 --> 34:10.000]  So,
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  when,
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  I met him for the first time,
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  he seemed,
[34:14.000 --> 34:15.000]  I mean,
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  I was like,
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000]  "oh, hello,
[34:17.000 --> 34:18.000]  my name's Val,
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  I'm the guy that's fucking your wife."
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  He's like,
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  "ah, ha, ha,
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  very funny."
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  It was a joke,
[34:23.000 --> 34:24.000]  and he laughed,
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  and he took it well.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  Val: And then he didn't
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  Fed: He took a chance.
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.000]  Val: I did,
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  I did.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  Everyone else laughed,
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  you know,
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  but,
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  he became more obsessive.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  The text increased
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  tremendously.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  I mean,
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  we're talking like 50 to 60,
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  "answer me,"
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  "what are you doing?"
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  "I don't understand."
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  And they were like,
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  really negative.
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  It's all designed to make her hurt,
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  feel like shit,
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  feel guilty,
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  you know,
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  or feel sorry for him.
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  Every single one is designed for that.
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.000]  I printed them all out,
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  gave them to the lawyer.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.000]  It's,
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  just to read them,
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  it's like weird.
[34:57.000 --> 34:58.000]  You guys,
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  it's a fun read,
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  if you ever want to,
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  if you're bored.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  I'll send it to you if you want.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  But it's disturbing,
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  too,
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  because it's a sign of obsession,
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  and that's never going to end well,
[35:07.000 --> 35:08.000]  you know.
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  So,
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  fast forward to a bunch of stuff,
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  on April 10th,
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.000]  or,
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  sorry,
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  before April 10th,
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.000]  COVID hit,
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  and Marlowe had to be
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  taught home,
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.000]  homeschooled now,
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  so he had the logins
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  to the computer,
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  you know,
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  such a nightmare at first.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  It was such a nightmare.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  Oh, man, yeah.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  Trying to get him to do homework,
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  and he's lying,
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  now he's lying all the time.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  And this kid,
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  he never lied.
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  He like,
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.000]  was so honest and happy,
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  you could put him anywhere,
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  and he would start talking to everybody,
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  and everyone would be
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  entranced by his conversation.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  He is a smart kid,
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  he's so smart.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  But now,
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  he's lying.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  I mean,
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  why is he lying?
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  Is he trying to hide something?
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  He's depressed,
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  is something's wrong,
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  he doesn't either,
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  but Marie always blames Steve,
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  no matter what,
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  it's always Steve.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  And I kind of learned
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.000]  that she's,
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.000]  you know,
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  almost always right too,
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  you know,
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  because he comes,
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  it's a 50-50 custody at this point.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Sorry,
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  for a year,
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  it was 50-50 custody.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  Before that,
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  it was 80-20,
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  Marie, okay?
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  But for the last year,
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  they tried 50-50.
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.000]  Steve says,
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.000]  and I have a lot of records,
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  saying I cannot take care
[36:15.000 --> 36:16.000]  of Marlowe for more than a week
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  at a time.
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  All he does
[36:18.000 --> 36:19.000]  is he sits in the little office,
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  and he writes the books.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  He works for screenwriting
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  for some comedy TV show,
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  it's not very funny.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  Two police officers
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  are detectives in a car
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  the whole time.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  Security?
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  Something security?
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  I don't know.
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.000]  It's not that good.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's not that good.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  So that's why he's in the country.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  Now Tim and Jammy.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  I needed,
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  Marie wanted to divorce him,
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  she's been wanting him
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  for so long,
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  but she can't,
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  because,
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  but because of the visa
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  that she was on,
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  she was tied to it,
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  she could not work in America,
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  and she was trying to do,
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  you know,
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  she would still
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  do some cash jobs,
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  or she'd teach French,
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  or art,
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  to the mothers,
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.000]  to go to a school called Lila, [sic]
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  it's a French,
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  for French people.
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.000]  And there's something
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  we were going on about that
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  school too,
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  you guys should be aware of.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  Very,
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  something's off.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  But,
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  what was I saying?
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  Sorry,
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  you know that Lila,
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  French school,
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  Val: and it brought up,
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  Fed: 80, 20, 50, 50.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  Val: Yeah, the custody,
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  that's right.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  Yeah.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  And then COVID.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  That's right.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  Yeah, she's,
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  well, now Marie works in rehab.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  She works at arts,
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  which is another crazy thing
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  about DCFS.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  She works in rehab,
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  which is randomly drug tested
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  every week, right?
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  So,
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  but I'll get to that.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  She teaches art therapy
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  to all these drug addicts.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  She's able to work,
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  and Marlowe's able to work,
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  and everything's going fine,
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  and then Steve,
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  one day, comes over,
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  because we're a day late,
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  or there was some misinterpretation,
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.000]  and this,
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  something happened,
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  someone didn't communicate
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  with someone about Marlowe,
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  when he was supposed to be picked up.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  Steve knows to never come
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  by our loft.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  He knows to never come by,
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  and we don't go to his place either.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  It's an unspoken rule.
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  He comes over,
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  and he,
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  he's wearing a mask
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  that was white,
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  but he drew,
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  and this was really weird,
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  I thought, he drew teeth.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  He's a 50 year old man,
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  okay, and he drew teeth
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  on the mask.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  He came over,
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  and I had a security camera,
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  so I had the whole thing on tape.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  It was wonderful,
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  this is fucking hilarious.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  But,
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  he goes,
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  he comes over,
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  and you know,
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  you see pedestrians stroll by,
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  and they're just normal people,
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  when you can see someone going for a run,
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  and someone just walking the dog,
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  but then you see a slow,
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  perambling,
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  what the hell is this?
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  And it's, of course, Steve.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  I mean, I don't know if he's high,
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  But he makes it to the front door,
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  he knocks,
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  he rolls up his one sleeve,
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  he's preparing for something, obviously.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  And,
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  now, I don't,
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  I only see this in retrospect.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  At the time,
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  I'm upstairs having a joke
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  and laughing with Marlowe and Marie.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Like, we're like on the floor laughing
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  about Weird Al Yankovic,
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  because Yoda,
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  you know what I'm saying, Yoda?
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Y-O-D-A Yoda?
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Yoda is great.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  But Marlowe just learned it,
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  so he was laughing.
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  And then the door is,
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  someone's knocking the door,
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  and it's around five o'clock, I remember,
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  because that's when Steve's always on time,
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  perfectly.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  And I'm like,
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  what the fuck?
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  So I said,
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  I'll go check,
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  and I open the door,
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  and I see Steve,
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  and Steve goes,
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  Marlowe,
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  Marlowe,
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  he starts screaming for Marlowe.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  Marie is so freaked out,
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  she takes Marlowe,
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  and she hides in the bathroom.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  It's the only door in the loft as a lock,
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  and it's like,
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  just the furthest,
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  it's the furthest from the front door,
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  actually, too.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  And I was like,
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  wow,
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  like she really,
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  she was fucking scared.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  And I don't know she's scared,
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  it's just like a little,
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  you know,
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  puny guy can barely walk,
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  so I,
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  but he starts,
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  he says,
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.000]  I want him to,
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  I'm here to pick up Marlowe,
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  and I say,
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  no, you're not,
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  you cannot be here,
[40:03.000 --> 40:04.000]  you're not supposed to be here.
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  What are you doing here?
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  You gotta go.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  No, I'm picking up Marlowe,
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  it's five o'clock,
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  look, just,
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  let me put on some shoes,
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  and some socks,
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  and a jacket,
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  and I was,
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  I wasn't fully dressed,
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  I was like,
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  sweatpants,
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  and shirt.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  Let me come outside,
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  and I'll,
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  and I'll talk to you about it.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  He said,
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  well,
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  there's not much to talk about,
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  but okay,
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  so he goes back,
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  I close the door,
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  and now,
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  what I learned later,
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  is when I closed the door,
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  he whipped out his cell phone,
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  and he opened up an app,
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  and he starts flipping through porn.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Normal, right?
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  No, not,
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  very odd behavior.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  I was like,
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  what the fuck,
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  but it wasn't like porn porn,
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  it was like dating site porn,
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  with the couples.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  It was fucking weird,
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  right?
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  To come over to the house,
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  knock on the door, be angry at me,
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  because he was kind of like,
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  his voice was raised,
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  I'm telling you,
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  like a really brief version,
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  but then just like,
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  not chill out,
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  like,
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  it was very strange.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  I tell him,
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  look, it's okay,
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  I'm gonna handle it,
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  and Marlowe says,
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  you know what,
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  my dad,
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  he just needs to be reassured,
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  and Marie's like,
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  no, no, no,
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  no reassuring,
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  just stay here with me in the bathtub,
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  and like,
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  you guys are just gonna be fine,
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  I'm just gonna talk to him,
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  and you'll leave.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  So I get dressed,
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  I open the door,
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  and the door opens up this way,
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  and then as my door,
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  as the door's open,
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  he comes in,
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  shoulder,
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  right here,
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  to break my,
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  my,
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  my grip,
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  on the door,
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  but I,
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  he's not that strong,
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  so I,
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  he doesn't break my grip,
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  he just makes me upset,
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  so I grab,
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  and I pull him out,
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  and he doesn't quite hit the car,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  his first reaction is,
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  oh, my back,
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  right,
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  like a,
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  sort of like a,
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  childish thing,
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  very strange,
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  for a 50-year-old man,
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.000]  and I said,
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  oh, shut the fuck up,
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  and I know you can hear me,
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  the profanity's [taken] out,
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  I'm like,
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  are you stupid,
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  are you that stupid,
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  I mean,
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  to fight a,
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  you know,
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  and I said,
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  this is California,
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  this is,
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  you know,
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  good thing I'm not like California,
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  because,
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  you know,
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  they carry guns,
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  like,
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  people can have guns,
You can be shot here. Fucking moron. He said are you threatening to shoot me? I said No I'm not threatening to shoot
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  I don't even have a gun,
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  you know,
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  things like this,
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  and then he,
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  he,
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  I said,
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  look,
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  this is on camera,
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.000]  then he's like,
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  you just lost,
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  you just lost the divorce,
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  you just lost everything,
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  you fucked up man,
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  you gotta go now,
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  he's like,
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  I'm not leaving,
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  so,
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  short version is,
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  I throw him out to the sidewalk,
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  I push him until he's in the,
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  it's still private property,
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  but I just sort of say,
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  now you're in the streets,
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  you can leave us alone now,
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  and I tell you,
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  I will,
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  and I made him a promise,
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  I will bring Marlowe out,
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  you can say hello to Marlowe,
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  I will bring him out,
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  and you have my word on that,
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  but you have to be by your car,
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  you cannot be on our property,
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  and he agrees to it,
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  goes to his car,
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  I said Marlowe,
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  please do me a favor,
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  can you come out with me,
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  but just don't let go of my hand,
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  and Marlowe says,
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  okay,
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  and he does not let go of my hand
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  the whole time,
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  because I know he's gonna try and steal him,
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  and he tried twice,
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  the whole time,
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  I recorded everything on my phone,
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  it's all,
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  it's all there,
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  and the video camera,
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  so when that incident occurred,
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.000]  Marie and I sat down and talked,
[43:05.000 --> 43:06.000]  and she said,
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  the deterioration has gone severe,
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  this is a line that's crossed,
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  and Marie's in the middle of divorce,
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  and to cross this line,
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  in the middle of divorce,
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  is very stupid,
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  okay,
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  so that means the brain has deteriorated
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  further than we even imagined,
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  so Marie is very concerned,
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  and she's like,
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  I'm not giving Marlowe back now,
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  so she holds on to Marlowe
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  for the last five months,
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  so we had Marlowe,
[43:35.000 --> 43:36.000]  and we were like,
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  it's fun to have like,
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  now we're like a family,
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  for five months,
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  we had fun,
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  you know,
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  we all got to know each other,
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  and Marlowe,
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  you know,
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.000]  it's really funny,
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  Val: it was nice.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  Fed: How long have you been living with Marlowe?
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  Val: Two and a half years now,
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  Val: but you know,
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  Val: you see Marlowe every other week.
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  Fed: Like five months?
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  Val: Yeah, yeah,
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  it was a lot at first,
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.000]  especially for me,
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.000]  but I got used to it,
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.000]  it wasn't,
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  it wasn't so,
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  you know,
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  I thought it was going to be even worse for me,
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.000]  but you know,
[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  expect the worst.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.000]  Val: It's a good day,
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  Fed: it could go any way.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  Val: Yeah, it's true, it's true,
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.000]  but you know,
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.000]  and we'd see Steven,
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  and the fear,
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  see the fear and the lying,
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  and we'd try to teach him to not lie,
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  like he starts lying,
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  like he talks,
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  I said,
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  Marlowe,
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.000]  why are these lies?
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  And we know where they come from,
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  because Steve,
[44:26.000 --> 44:27.000]  this is how Steve talks,
[44:27.000 --> 44:28.000]  he lies constantly,
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  he's always,
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  he's always,
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  and we felt like we made some progress,
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  you know,
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.000]  he was,
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  he had more self-confidence,
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  like he was afraid of dancing,
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  an eight year old,
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  afraid of dancing,
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.000]  because he's self-conscious,
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.000]  he's fucking silly,
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  so we started dancing more
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  to make him less self-conscious,
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  and we did these kung fu outfits,
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  so we pretended we were kung fu fighting,
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  you know,
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  the song kung fu fighting,
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  he loves it,
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  so his confidence is back,
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  he's happy,
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  and he fucking said to me,
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  three days before this,
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  all went to shit,
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  he said,
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  Val,
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  I wish you were my father,
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  he said to me,
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  and it broke my heart,
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  it broke my heart,
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  I mean,
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  I felt great and warm,
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.000]  but it also broke my heart,
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  you know,
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  and I know that feeling,
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  because I grew up in foster care,
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  you know,
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  I know that feeling,
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  I've been to two different,
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  different families,
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  and different mothers,
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.000]  and different fathers,
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.000]  I had two brothers once in foster care,
[45:16.000 --> 45:17.000]  you know,
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.000]  Val: you know, home.
[45:18.000 --> 45:19.000]  Fed: You remember it pretty well?
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  Val: Yeah, yeah,
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  and one I don't,
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  two I remember pretty well,
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  the last one I remember very well,
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  because there was,
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  there wasn't the horrible system
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  that you hear about,
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  this is a nice happy Jewish family,
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  a loving family,
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  they're like good people,
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  you know,
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  even in Chicago,
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  in Cook County,
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  Carol and Larry Paless,
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  I remember,
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  it's not like the shoe store,
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.000]  Val: it's Paless,
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  Fed: oh,
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.000]  Fed: sometimes if it a different time, [??]
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  Fed: it's a lot like a crap shoot, [??]
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.000]  Val: I see.
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  Val: Yeah,
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  I got lucky,
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.000]  I got lucky,
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  because I heard the stories,
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  Val: you know,
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.000]  Fed: Is Marie divorced, or is that still ongoing?
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  Val: it's still,
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  it's still in the middle, yeah.
Fed: [unintelligible question]
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  Val: No, nothing,
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  there's fighting,
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  and Steve is using this now,
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  as a tool in the divorce,
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  everything that just happened is,
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  weaponizing DCFS,
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  he just did it,
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  and for a guy with limited capacity,
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  I know that it wasn't him,
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  it's gotta be the lawyers,
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  his lawyers are pretty smart,
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  because he's got money,
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  he's got like seven lawyers,
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  you know,
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  you have one guy
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  that barely leaves his office,
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  we do most of the work,
[46:28.000 --> 46:29.000]  Marie and I.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  Anyway,
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  so Marie and I are like,
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  we've gone through two cleaning ladies,
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  one live in the brewery,
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  and one girl,
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  she's great,
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  she was like too cute for me,
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  because,
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  Marie,
[46:46.000 --> 46:47.000]  why are you staring at her?
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  I'm not staring at her,
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  leave me alone, why does she have to worry
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.000]  about these tight pants?
[46:50.000 --> 46:51.000]  I'm like,
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  I don't know, I didn't ask her,
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  it's not my fault,
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.000]  and then one day,
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  she's like,
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.000]  you know what,
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  I don't want to clean,
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  I want to sing,
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.000]  I want to make music,
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.000]  I'm like, okay,
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.000]  go make some music,
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  so she quit,
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  so we start cleaning,
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.000]  and we try,
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.000]  you know,
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  Marlowe gets in trouble,
[47:06.000 --> 47:07.000]  we're like,
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  oh,
[47:08.000 --> 47:09.000]  you gotta do the dishes,
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  you know,
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.000]  you have to wipe and clean,
[47:11.000 --> 47:12.000]  and he doesn't like that either,
[47:12.000 --> 47:13.000]  so we thought,
[47:13.000 --> 47:14.000]  why not do,
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  get a nanny slash,
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  a housekeeper,
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  okay,
[47:17.000 --> 47:18.000]  somebody can do both,
[47:18.000 --> 47:19.000]  watch Marlowe,
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  we can have some time alone,
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  and they can clean the fucking house.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  So we do put the feelers out,
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  Marie puts them out
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  on Nextdoor,
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  a couple other websites.
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  I ask everybody,
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  I know,
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  oh,
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  sorry,
[47:34.000 --> 47:35.000]  I forgot,
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.000]  I almost forgot Pattil.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  Pattil is a neighbor,
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  one,
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  two,
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  three,
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  three doors down,
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  four doors down,
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  I thought she'd just moved in,
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  in like July,
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  or sorry,
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  mid June,
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  I'd never seen her before,
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.000]  but all of a sudden,
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.000]  she's there,
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  everywhere,
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  very loud and boisterous,
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  and she,
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  outside,
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  look,
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  at our place,
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.000]  there's a little park
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  across the way,
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  and Marlowe always hangs out there,
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  and so everyone,
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.000]  sort of,
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  the brewery,
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  the brewery,
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  artist loft,
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  it's like an artist community,
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  so it's a campus,
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  more or less,
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  and it's just 300 lofts,
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  with a whole bunch of it,
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  with six or 900 people in it,
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  it's a different spot,
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  so everyone hangs out
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.000]  in the sort of park areas,
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  where we are,
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  because it's closest to us.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  She says,
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  she saw him in the park,
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  and she showed him his jewelry,
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  and he said,
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  oh, I want to make this,
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  crystal jewelry,
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  and I was like,
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  you want to make crystal jewelry?
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  He's like,
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  yes,
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  I want to make crystal jewelry.
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  Like, okay, Marlowe,
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  you can make some crystal jewelry.
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  So we take him over there,
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  and she seems sane, right?
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  I know something's off,
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  you know,
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  I mean,
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  I can sense it,
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  I know something's wrong,
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  but I figure maybe this is like,
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  she's in a,
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  just got outta her parents' house,
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  or she's moving,
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  trying to make her life,
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  or start a new world.
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  I mean,
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  there's no way she's making money
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  selling crystal jewelry, okay?
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  It's,
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  first of all,
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  it's shitty jewelry,
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  no one's buying it,
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  and it's way too expensive.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  It's not $4,500 a month,
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  on that place.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  I know what she's paying too.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  So,
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  I figure there's some parents
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  paying for it,
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  or something,
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  or maybe a brother,
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  definitely not a sugar daddy type,
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  because she's the most unattractive
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  woman I've ever seen.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  Like,
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  you see her,
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  and you're like,
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  whoa,
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  okay,
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  and it's unfortunate for her,
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  but it is true.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  So,
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  anyway,
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.000]  she,
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  we brought her over,
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  and we approved
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  for like two hours a day.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  We thought that couldn't be,
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  literally,
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  you can walk in 10 seconds
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  and get to her house,
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  or something.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  It's like,
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  there's no danger,
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  you know?
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  And Marlowes said,
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  please, please,
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  can I have that crystal jewelry, please?
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  Okay,
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  yes,
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  and we get two hours to ourselves now.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  So,
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  we're happy.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  So,
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  for five days,
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  and he makes crystal jewelry.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  He comes back for lunch.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  He eats with us.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  Sometimes,
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  Marie brings them lunch.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  Sometimes,
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  I'll go over there
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  and just see what's going on.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  Everything's friendly and copacetic.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  You can always,
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  she's no problem.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  She's a talker.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  She likes to jab her
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  about herself.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  She will not ask you anything
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  about how you are,
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  where you're from,
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  or anything.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  She'll just tell you everything
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  she knows about everybody.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  Gossip,
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  Val: gossip, gossip.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  Fed: People are like that.
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  Val: Yeah,
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  yeah.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  It's,
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  well,
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  it's because that's what she thinks
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  her value is, what her information is
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  and that's why we're,
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  you know,
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.000]  it's very,
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  Fed: I understand it,
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  Fed: but,
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  Fed: but when I met him,
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  Fed: Marlowe,
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  Fed: liked,
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  Fed: making crafts.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  Val: Anything,
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.000]  and we found someone,
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  like,
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  I'll talk to him, too.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  And that was like,
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  you know,
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  it was so,
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  it was interesting,
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  but he loved it.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  And he even said,
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  Val,
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  Val you know,
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  I realized my whole,
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  my whole life?
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  I've wanted to make crystal jewelry.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Your whole life,
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  figures out.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  He's like,
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  it's a huge revelation,
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  yeah.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  All right, Marlowe,
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  you go for it.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  Of course,
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  he got bored with it,
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  you know,
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  four days later.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  But on Saturday,
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  Pattil decided to sell the jewelry
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  that she had been making with Marlowe.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  So,
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  they go and they set up
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  a thing in the park,
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  like,
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  just a table,
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  and all the people from
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  the community come over
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  and they see Marlowe,
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.000]  and he's fucking adorable,
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  selling jewelry,
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  so people buy jewelry.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  Of course,
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  I buy most of it,
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  you know,
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  so,
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  and I have to buy some Patil's jewelry, too,
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  because it looks bad,
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  but she's not really selling any.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  So,
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  I buy some of her,
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  so I spend like 250 bucks
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  on this useless jewelry
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  that's already broken,
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.000]  right?
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  Um,
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  Steve is
Fed: How many?
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  $250. I don't know.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  No,
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  no,
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.000]  I've not,
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  but it's like 30 pieces,
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  you know,
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  it's ridiculous.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  Yeah,
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  you don't need it,
[51:28.000 --> 51:29.000]  trust me.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  It's not necessary.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.000]  But,
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  but Steve,
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  I invite Steve,
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  because I'm a nice guy.
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  So,
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  I'm like,
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.000]  Steve would like to see this.
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  His son is making money
[51:38.000 --> 51:39.000]  on something he created
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  on his own.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  We have a picture of him with his first $20.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  he's ever earned.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  Steve would like to see this.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  I think it would be a good idea.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  And Marie's like,
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  no.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  I say,
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  come on,
[51:49.000 --> 51:50.000]  let him,
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.000]  he's got to,
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  he'll enjoy this.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  Because we give him visits every week
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.000]  or whenever he wants to,
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.000]  well,
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  not whenever,
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  basically once a week,
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  but whenever he wants to talk to Marlowe,
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  we let him talk,
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.000]  unless Marlowe does not want to talk
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  and not as often.
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  And he does not want to accept that.
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  Um,
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  so,
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  I invite him over
[52:05.000 --> 52:06.000]  and he comes over
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  and,
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  um,
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  and,
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  oh, shit.
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  Um,
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  I forgot I'm working today too,
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  but it's okay.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  I put on an option
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  because I don't have to worry about it
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  till next week.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  Um,
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  so,
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  he comes over
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.000]  and he's
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.000]  instantly in the mood changes.
[52:25.000 --> 52:26.000]  You'll,
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  if you ever meet him,
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  you'll see for yourself.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  You know,
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.000]  it's one of those people,
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  everything's sort of down,
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  depressing
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  and self-conscious.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  You know,
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  because that's what he,
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  that's what he emulates[???].
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  Um,
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  Marlowe seems somewhat immune
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  to it right now,
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  but he won't be in the future.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  I know it.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  I could see it happen.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  Um,
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  he asked Patille
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  for her number.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  Steve.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  Steve does.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  Which I thought was strange.
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  Um,
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  but not too strange.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  Marie said
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  he never asked people
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  for her number.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  This is not a good idea.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  Okay.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  And I said,
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  well,
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  I'll trust you.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  Um,
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  later that night,
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  Patille,
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  uh,
[53:06.000 --> 53:07.000]  Marie and I are,
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  uh, walking.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  For some reason,
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  we didn't walk to the,
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  now we weren't doing the laundry,
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  we had to walk past the park.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  I can't remember why.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  Um,
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  and we see Patille
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  and three other girls
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.000]  sitting in the park
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  by candlelight talking.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  And I go,
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  hey,
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  nice to see you guys.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  We're going back,
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  going to bed,
[53:23.000 --> 53:24.000]  cause I had to wake up early
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  for some reason.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  Um,
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  I can't remember why.
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  I had to wake up early.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  I was upset at Marie
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.000]  for making me stay up so late.
[53:30.000 --> 53:31.000]  You know,
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  I was like,
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  I had to,
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  he promised me
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  to get to bed before,
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  and I had to do extra shit
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.000]  for something.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  So she says,
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  okay,
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  don't worry,
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  let's just have a quick talk
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  with Patille
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  and talk about the day.
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  So,
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  you know,
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  okay,
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  fine.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  But that quick talk with Patille
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  means she's going to talk
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  to you at you for an hour.
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  You know,
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  and of course,
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  I'm,
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  and Marie never does it,
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  so I'm the one that says,
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  okay,
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  enough,
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  I've got to go to sleep.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  Right?
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  I'm going to have to be the asshole.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  So I say,
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  okay, fine.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  She comes into our place
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  for the first time. Said "oh cool what a great place you have, awesome"
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  In the living room, that's it. Patille. In our entrance living room, we have a loft, there's an upstairs, back room, there's a whole bunch of fucking space.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  And I'm like, okay, great, Marie let's just go outside and smoke a cigarette and have a go.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  She says, okay.
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.000]  Go outside and we're underneath now my surveillance camera, okay?
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  And I have a 30-day fucking break point.
[54:27.000 --> 54:36.000]  Marie is typing a letter now to send to LogiCircle to get this fucking tape because this will change everything.
[54:36.000 --> 54:43.000]  Patille and we're smoking a cigarette and Patille goes on a tirade about how much she sees evil in Steve.
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  I looked in his eyes and all I saw was pure evil.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  You know, like they're really dramatic.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  She's like really, she gets in my face like, I don't really, I got in his eyes and I saw nothing.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  It was blank. It was evil.
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  I said, no, Patille, what you saw was emptiness. There's just nothing in there.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  He's not very smart.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  She was, no, no, no, it was evil.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  This was our conversation for like a good 15 minutes, right?
[55:09.000 --> 55:17.000]  So not only are we confident that Patille hates Steve, you know, that she's not going to sell us out or do anything stupid.
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  We were like, okay, she's, you know, we believe her.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  But, you know, I don't realize and I'm stupid because I forgot this is classic bipolar.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  That's what I picked up on.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  This woman is fucking classic bipolar.
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.000]  And I've seen this so many times and I was dumb to not listen to my instinct that first day when I knew something was wrong.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  I didn't know what it was.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  I didn't think about it hard enough.
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  I think that's where I fucked up because that's what she is.
[55:42.000 --> 55:48.000]  And now I see it because they flip one extreme to the next and that's exactly what happened.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  Now in her report, she says she reached out to Steve via Instagram.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  Not true.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  They have, she's got a phone number.
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  Okay.
[55:56.000 --> 56:05.000]  She wrote a report because we stopped seeing her after this because also there was something she was fucking dancing naked with Marlowe, supposedly.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  Marlowe says she was dancing, but she may or may or not have been naked.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  Val: So Marlowe doesn't really understand.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  Fed: Could be either way.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  Val: Right.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  So I don't know what that means with Marlowe, but I don't like it.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  He said he felt uncomfortable.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  He tried not to look.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  All he said, all I wanted to do was finish making the jewelry and she wanted to dance.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  So that was enough for us to think this is enough of this.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  Okay.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  We put him in camp the next day.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  He goes to a beach day camp for the next two weeks.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  Now we don't hear from Pattil for a long time.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.000]  We think something's wrong.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  Why [isn't/doesn't] she, like, say hello?
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  We don't see because she's not boisterous and friendly.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  Then we get hit with Steve's lawyers.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  Like a dossier.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  They send like a thing saying here are the witness statements I have.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  Why you're such a terrible person.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  Here's why I'm great.
Fed: [Asks something]
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  Not quite a review.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  It's like an aggregate.
[57:01.000 --> 57:08.000]  Val: Yeah, summary of what she wanted and other people saying that Marie is a terrible person.
Fed: When was the statement?
[57:08.000 --> 57:20.000]  Val: I want to say July 30th approximately July 30th.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  So we see this and what we read is so fucking outrageously crazy.
[57:27.000 --> 57:37.000]  She said that Marlowe is walking around without a shirt barefoot and is combing through garbage for fucking food.
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  Seriously.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  He's going through dumpster for food.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  And he says Marie is doing the same thing.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  Or sorry, she says Marie is doing the same thing.
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.000]  And then she says that Marie is walking around itching and scratching with sores all over her body.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.000]  A classic junkie.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  She named every single drug in the world from fucking crystal meth to PCP to
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  Some exotic crazy shit.
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  You never even heard of, you know.
[58:00.000 --> 58:06.000]  She says that there is a secret hidden room in her loft where all the drugs are stored in the paraphernalia.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  Okay.
[58:07.000 --> 58:16.000]  She says I have 40, I'm not exaggerating, 40 to 50 cell phones scattered on the tables.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  Okay.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  Not fucking exaggerating.
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  And it's even worse.
[58:21.000 --> 58:22.000]  They're worse crazy shit.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  But those are the ones I remember right now.
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.000]  And we're like what the fuck.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  You know, and immediately I think that Steve paid her.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  Val: He had to pay her.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  Val: But this is before I figured out the bipolar thing.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  Fed: What is the lawyer asking for?
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  Val: They want nothing.
[58:40.000 --> 58:41.000]  Val: The lawyer said nothing.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  Val: This is like a tactic.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  Fed: At this point you guys are full custody.
[58:47.000 --> 58:51.000]  Val: Well, see the custody arrangement as far as I understand it.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  Val: Again, I'm not a lawyer and I've never been through it.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  But since they're still married they both have equal rights to Marlowe.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  But no one has any, there are no rules set.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  So it was a verbal agreement to say 50-50 for a year.
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  So when Marie said no 50-50 it was perfectly legal for her to do that.
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.000]  And then she felt bad and she thought well maybe I should give him to,
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  and also we could want it some time alone after a couple months or like,
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  maybe we should give him to Steve for like a month,
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  or sorry, for a week.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  And then our lawyer said no.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  Because there was no rule to stop him from keeping Marlowe.
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  You know, just as you did he can do the same.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  So we're like okay, so we keep him.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  So when we see this thing from Patille it just freaks us out.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  Like what the fuck.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  And then DCFS comes over.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  And I never heard of DCFS.
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  I don't know what the acronym stood for.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  I'm sure I was visited by them as a child.
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  Because it seems like I remember something.
[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  I did have a social worker I remember.
[59:50.000 --> 59:54.000]  But the first woman that came over was named Priscilla.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  And she was very nice.
[59:56.000 --> 59:59.000]  She came over and she, I let her in which is stupid.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  And I realized now you should never let them in if they ever come to your house.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  It's a thing you can take.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  They can never take away a child if you don't let them in.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  That's what I was told by Laura.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  But she came in.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  She viewed the house.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It was safe.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  It was loving.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  It was fun.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It was a good fucking home.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  And she reported that.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Okay.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Now Marie said to her in her interview that there was an incident that she was worried about.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  And I remember very well.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  We came home from shopping one day.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  And Marlowe just starts telling us like a confession.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  This crazy story about touching penises at the Mark and Bobax [sic] house.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  These people that sort of turned on Marie.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  They were friends of Marie.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  And then some reason they were not.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  They just turned and then chose Steve's side.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Because people when you divorce.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  People would pick sides.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  It's shitty.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  People are fucking shitty.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  You call someone a friend.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  I mean, it really hurt her.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  It really hurt her.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  And the things they said were so fucking ridiculous and stupid.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Anyway, it's the...
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  What was the point of that?
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Sorry.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  I need some more coffee.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  I'm talking too much about coffee.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Okay.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  So what was it just before that?
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Oh, DCFS.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Priscilla comes to the house
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  She says, are you willing to take drugs tests?
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  And we say, yes, you're willing to take drugs test.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Great.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  We don't hear back from her for about three or four days.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Actually, we've never heard back from her.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  That was the last we saw of Priscilla.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Next thing we know, police are at the door.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  This is actually the second time police came.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  They came before Priscilla came.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  And then they came.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Then Priscilla and then the police came again.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  And then...
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  No, this is Saba Habte.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  And Erasmo... [sic]
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Aguiler. [sic]
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Val: Aguiler.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Val: Not Aguiler, but Aguiler without the A.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Fed: Those are not the police?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Val: Those are not the police.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Val: These are more DCFS.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Fed: DCFS?
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Val: Yeah.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  Val: And now it's 10.30 at night and they're coming knocking door at 10:30 at night.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  And so, Marie's not home.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  She's at Amy's.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And it's all video camera.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  I'll put it on YouTube, I'll send you a link.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  And they are...
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  You know, first they wake up Marlowe.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  They're banging on the door.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  And Marlowe was asleep.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  I was asleep.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Because I woke up fucking early to the trade options.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  You know, like 6 o'clock, 6.30.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  The market's open at 6.30.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  I have to be awake and ready at 6.30 a.m.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  So, you know, I'm half asleep.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And Marlowe's like,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Someone's at the door.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Someone's at the door.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  I'm like, Marlowe, why aren't you asleep?
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  You're supposed to be asleep.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  They woke me up.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  They woke me up.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  It's okay.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  So I go out and I open the door.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And I see...
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  And they say, "we're DCFS
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Val: We're going to talk to you."
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  I'm like, I just spoke to you guys.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  You were just here, you know?
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  And he's like, well, you got another call.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  And I'm like, fucking...
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And I know it's Pattil calling every day.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Pattil and Steve's together calling every day.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Just to fuck with us.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  To see where they can get.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  I know it.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  You know?
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And they know it too.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  So I'm like, you know, I'm just sort of sick of it.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I don't really want to do this anymore.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  But I talk to them.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  We have a conversation.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  I'm very friendly.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  You know, I'm not...
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  I don't give them any shit.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And they just...
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  I don't remember legally if they...
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  If I invited them or they just walked in the house.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  So they ended up getting in the house.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  I don't remember saying, yeah, go ahead, please.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Come in for another round.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  But they did.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  And they did the rounds.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  And we joked and we laughed.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Now, here's...
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  No.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  This is where I...
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  We broke down.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  Marie and I have been doing this for three days.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Like, nonstop.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  Working on this thing that you guys sent.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  You know, breaking every single word by word,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  every line by line.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Where the lies are and what we can prove.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  We have documentary evidence for it when we don't.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Right?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  For example, she says, I knocked on the door
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  and took about ten minutes to come to the door.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  It took two minutes and thirty-two seconds.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  Okay?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  Two minutes and thirty-two fucking seconds.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  She says, we went through the house.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  There was no food in the refrigerator.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  It was scarce.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  We had just ordered about three hundred and fifty-four hundred dollars
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  from Amazon delivery.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Fresh, direct.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  To come fucking two guys full of...
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  car full of food.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  It was overflowing.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  We made jokes.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  I joked them.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  I said, look, ha!
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Guess you can't say
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  We're starving him.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  And we all laughed about it.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  In the report, it says, scarce.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Those are just, like, too little things.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  Val: No, I'm not even getting into the big ones.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  Fed: It was delivered the next day.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  Val: No, it was there.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  It was already there.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  The night before, we had got ordered it.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And we had packed up the fridge and the pantries.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  All right?
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  It was like, what the fuck?
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  We couldn't believe what we were reading.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  And if you read that thing, the first fourteen, fifteen pages are like,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  okay, fine.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  So it's normal.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  Nothing's wrong here.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  And then we become, like, the worst people you've ever heard.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  It's like fucking crazy shit.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  And somehow, I don't give her the number.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  She has Tim's number.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  How the fuck does she get Tim's number?
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  And she says, and there's a little note at the end,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  because she's trying to discredit me as much as she can.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  And you can see that it's really hard.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Worse than David Enrich did at The New York Times.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Like, really come after me.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  But I don't understand.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  I what I did to anger her.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  I have a recording, because I've learned to record pretty much everything.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  You know, it's smart, because no way people can fuck with you.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  And another question, why?
Fed: You're not, are you?
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  Like, I am.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  I'm joking.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  I'm just going to steal it from your cloud later.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  But what was I saying?
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  I recorded her saying, Val, obviously, you know, the house is great.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  Obviously, Marlowe loves you and you love Marlowe.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  It's not, you know, you guys are great.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Just, we want you to take a drug test, and that's it.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  And I'm like, okay, that's it.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  I agreed.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  And then I said, and then there's another phone call later,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  because the next day, four police officers came.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  And that's where I was just, I had enough.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  I'm like, look, more fucking police officers.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  Ed, this is the fourth day in a row, and you're still doing this.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  At what point is this harassment?
Fed: This is August?
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  This is like a few weeks ago.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Yeah.
Fed: July or August?
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  Oh, this is, what's today the 12th?
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  So today, yeah, we're in August now.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  We're in August.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  I was looking at the footage last night again.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  It was July 29th.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  This must be the 30th now.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  30th or August 1st, right around there.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Because the police came the next day, so it must be the 30th.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  Val: How many days are in July?
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Fed: 31.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  Val: So it's 30th or 31st.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Val: Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  Val: I didn't even know.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Val: I had zero ideas when I asked.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Fed: So, yeah.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Fed: So all of this stuff that's happening,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Fed: is that what was court on, what was it, on Monday?
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  Val: No, no, no.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  It gets worse.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  It gets worse when you get to what happens on Sunday.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  So I'm like, I say, Saba, look,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  and I read her this email.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  I said, look, nothing personal against you.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  You seem like a good person.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  I just, I'm tired of everyone of you guys believing this woman
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  and accepting this as fact and not even investigating the caller.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  Clearly, this woman is out of her mind.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  And how can you not delineate sane from insane,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  I think that's your job, but I didn't say it like that.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  I said it very kindly.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  I have a copy of it.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  I'll forward it to you.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  And I said, look, I'm just going to say we'll do the drug test,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  but that's it.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  We're going to put our foot down.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  We're not going to do anything else after the drug test.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  All right.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  We're just going to, we're not going to, we're going to stop.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  So you tell us what the next move is and we will oblige.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  And that I can quote.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  I mean, I said that tell us what the next move is
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  and we will oblige.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  That's a quote, right?
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  And then I didn't hear from her.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  And then Tuesday of that week, we interviewed a cleaning lady.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  She came to us from, see, I still think Pattil sent her this woman
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  because I asked Pattil, do you know anyone that will clean and babysit?
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  Because I feel bad that you, I don't want you to think
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  we're sending Marlowe over to your place to babysit.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  Okay.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  So I was trying to overcompensate by saying,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  please give me the name and number of a fucking babysitter.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  You know, so that way she wouldn't think that.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  You know, so I still suspect it came from her,
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  but Marie thinks it came from somebody else.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  So I don't know.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  But she called us and said, I heard you're looking for a babysitter.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  And I said, yes, we are, but also a cleaning lady too.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  Like you need to be able to clean.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  So she says, I can do that.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  And so we meet her on Tuesday.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  I honestly have no memory of this meeting.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  But Marie says we met on Tuesday.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  I don't know
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  why I don't remember it.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  I mean, briefly, I remember saying, okay, thank you, shaking a hand.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  But I don't know, maybe because I didn't sleep much the night before.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Cause I mean, it's really weird when you don't sleep, you know,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  and then, you know, cause I'll take a nap at like 1:30 when the market closes.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  And then my mind will refresh itself.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  But sometimes I don't get that nap.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  So, but Marie showed me and she said, look, right here,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  you can see the text between Lori and us.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  She was here on Tuesday.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  So she went back home and she came back on Friday.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  And that was her first day.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  She worked Friday and she was good.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  And we paid her 80 bucks and sent her home. On Saturday.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  She comes back, but she comes late.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  Okay.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  She is like very late.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  And she says, I went to the dentist and had an abscess.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  And she showed pictures to prove it that she was at the dentist.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I said, okay, fine.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  So she does all the cleans all of the kitchen,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  does all the dishes and does the sheets, half the sheets of laundry.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  It takes Marlowe with her.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  One interesting thing happened.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Marlowe was freaked out in the laundry room.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  And he said to his mom and friends that she,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  Lori turned white and really white.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  And he thought she was going to die.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  This is Marlowe.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  So he was very scared for her.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  And we sat her down.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  We asked her, are you okay?
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  She said, I'm fine.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  I'm fine.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  It's a COPD she has.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  It's called, it's some sort of pulmonary thing.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Val: I don't really know.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  Fed: Apparently.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Val: Yes.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  Apparently she has machines at home.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  She has a machine, like a little machine that helps her breathe.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  Which I'm like, okay.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  And she had a bunch of these things.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  The inhaler.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  And it's strange.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Everyone has an inhaler.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  She knows, but there's a different looking one.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  It's very odd.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  And it has the date and a wheel.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  So I don't know that much about that one.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  She doesn't want to go home.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  Okay.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  She's like 60 years old, mid 60s actually.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Found out how old she was.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  She was born in 1960.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  So she's exactly 60 years.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  And then the reason I did that math really quick is because I already knew the answer.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Okay.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  I knew the answer.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So she starts crying.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  At first it was a laugh.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  I heard them both laughing upstairs and I said, what's so funny?
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  What's the joke?
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  I want to know the joke.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  And I go, oh, you won't get it.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  You're a man.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  I'm like, oh, okay, fine.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  And then I go to the bathroom and then I come out and the crying turned to sobbing.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Severe fucking sobbing.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  She was hugging Marie and Marie looked at me like, you know, she also gave me like the
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  go away.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  It's a girl thing.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  You're not going to let me handle it.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  It's okay.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  So I go downstairs and Marie says, look, let's let her stay.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  She doesn't want to go home.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  So we'll put her up in the, we have in the little room at the top of the, if you see the layout,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  come over.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  You guys will see the layout for yourselves.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  So she stays in the little room upstairs.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  I don't think much too much about it.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  It's not a big deal.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  She wakes up, she takes a bath, which is odd.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  You know, you don't do that.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  It's a weird behavior.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  She takes a bath and she starts cleaning again.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  And we're like, okay, fine.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Clean again.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Sunday was the last, a third day anyway.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  We did a three day trial and it was the final day.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  So we knew she was gone for good no matter what on Sunday.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  She's always going out to her car.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  Okay.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Which I did not think was too suspicious.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  I just thought she was going to smoke a joint or something because she came back a little, you know,
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  different, but happy, always happy, not miserable.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And she would talk about her life a little bit.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  She told us about her daughter in Italy and she married a very wealthy Italian guy.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  And then it gets to be around 9.30, 10.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  And I'm like, Marie, you handled the hours.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  I don't, we're not going to pay her for the time she slept.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Right.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  We're not paying her.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  So you take care of this.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  I don't want to deal with it.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Just tell me the number and I'll send her the money.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Marie goes, says, okay.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Next thing I'm in my office area.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Marie is not with her.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  She comes in and says, I'm really tired.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Do you mind if I lay down for a few minutes before I drive home?
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  And I say, sure, fine, no problem.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  So she's wearing like a jacket getting ready to, she's ready to leave.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And then I look at her and like, she's actually ready to leave.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  It's good.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  Take a nap.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  Go for it.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  She lies down.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  She doesn't wake up.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  Val: She dies.
Fed: [Unintelligible]
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  Val: She fucking died on her bed.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  She's fucking dead.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Like fucking dead.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Right.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  And the only reason I knew she was dead was later because I mean, I thought she was alive
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  because at any moment I thought she was going to pop up and we're pushing her and stuff like that.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  And I tried to feel for a pulse and I sort of remember what to do.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And I swear to God, I felt the pulse and there was warmth in her wrist.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  And it was, unless I was feeling my own pulse in my fingers, which people do that too.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  I don't know.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  But it wasn't until she, like, I don't know anything about it.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  I mean, I saw my father dead, but I never saw that this happened.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  Like her face turned, it was like a bruise color.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  It was a purplish.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  It was not natural.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And that's when we knew, like, holy shit, this woman is dead.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  And now it's fucking scary.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  So we were freaked out.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  Marlowe did not see anything.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  He was asleep.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  He was asleep.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  He's got his little treehouse room on the other side of the wall.
Fed: [Unintelligible]
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  Of course.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Jesus.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  I mean, we didn't want him walking in either.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  So at all times, I had someone had to be in front of that door just in case he came down.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Like, yeah, he doesn't want some more Cheerios, you know, kind of like TV.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  But of course, this morning, Marlowe, you can watch all the TV you want.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  You go upstairs and you watch TV.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  This is TV morning, right?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  You watch as much as you want.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  And Marie called the ambulance.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And then all hell broke loose, man.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  The ambulance came.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  And what we learned later from the report, because it's in the report,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  was that, supposedly, Saba, Saba, hate with a B, Habte,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  was talking to Pattil at 9.30 a.m. in the morning on a Monday, which is weird.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Because Pattil did not, she either did not sleep the night before or this is all a lie.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  Okay.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And calls and says, holy shit, there's an ambulance going to Val's and Marie's.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Come over now.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  And then she calls Steve.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  And Steve comes over.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  So LAPD is there.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  The ambulance people are there.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Steve is there.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Pattil is there.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  And not only is she there, but she is screaming at him.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  He's calling us murderers, saying profanities.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  Throwing fucking rocks.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Throwing fucking rocks.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  All right.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  That's how fucking crazy she is.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Not only did she show up, but all the people that hate us in the building are there.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  Just like really enjoying this.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Not in the building, but the campus.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  And there's a, there's three or four of them.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  You know, and one of them is the management.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  We're in a huge fight with the management.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  A woman named Ashley Madison.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Ashley Madison.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  I didn't hack that.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Actually, something, she's just a pain in the ass.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  And she decided, oh, can I just tell you, police officers that Val, we always thought Val was on drugs.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  We always thought Marie was on drugs.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  And blah blah blah
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Okay.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  And she, and then this guy named Stauche.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  And I'll tell you, he's like one of these people that always wished he was a Marine, you know, the types.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  They're like, they wear like the clothes, like they pretend that they were served in Vietnam.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  And they pretend they served in Afghanistan, but they never did anything.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  And they never even left their town.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  And he works at the building too.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  He opens the door for the cars, basically.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  He's like a door for cars.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  But the attitude, and he's very, he's got this racist fucking thing too.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  And he was there too.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  And he said, excuse me, officer, I would like to talk to you in person alone afterwards.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Yeah, I know exactly.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  He's just going to talk shit about me.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  And I just was like, what the fuck is happening?
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  The film crew that's following me around, they came.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  And they said, there was so much animosity in the air.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  They said, we knew, and we don't want to tell you this, but we feel like this was the whole setup.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  This was planned.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  Like there was people, there was evil there.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  Val: There was something hatred there for you.
Fed: There's a film crew following you?
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  Val: Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  His name's Rocco.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  It wasn't obviously not now.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  And I haven't told him about this, so don't worry.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  But Rocco Castoro, he was the former editor-in-chief of Vice.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  Val: And he's doing a documentary.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  Fed: [Unintelligible]
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Val: Sorry?
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  Fed: Yeah, I think I saw it on YouTube.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  Val: Oh, you did?
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  Val: It's up?
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  Fed: Formerly with VICE
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  Val: Yeah.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  Fed: [Unintelligible]
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  Val: Yeah, a new thing, some dude named Tim Pool, which I don't know him,
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  but I heard bad things.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  So I'm trying to distance myself from that name, is what I've been told.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  It's like, well, whatever you do, don't associate yourself with that name.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  Val: But he's financing this project for some reason.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  Fed: Yeah, trying to recreate Vice magic.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Val: Exactly.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  He was fired, actually.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  Yeah.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  It was the way he tells the sexual harassment thing that they were covering up in HR.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  And it was a whole mess, because the sexual harassment was from Weins-
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  the head of HR worked for Harvey Weinstein as well.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  This is a whole fucking mess.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  It's like a real fucking crazy shit.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  Anyway, don't believe everything Rocco says, because he exaggerates and embellishes a lot.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  But he did say, like, we were not welcome.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  They told us to leave right away.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  And not dating the police, the building.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  So they had to take all this stuff and go.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  And then Marie also said, I felt like we were set up.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  I felt like, how did the fuck did Saba already have a court date ready on the back of her card when she came?
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  How is that possible?
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  How did she have that court date for Monday?
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  And I was like, I don't know.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  I don't know how DCFS works.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Apparently, the due process is not a thing there.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  There's no such thing as due process.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  They can do whatever the fuck they want.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  And that is fucking terrifying.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  And if you read that report and you were me, you would see.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  If you could see from my point of view, which I don't know if you'll be able to because you're not me.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  You don't know what I'm like and what Marie's like and Marlowe's like and Pattil and Steve.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  It's fucking terrifying that this is in the public record.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  And there's a judge that yesterday, the judge heard this.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  And I'm sorry.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  I skipped ahead. Habte, the social worker.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  She comes.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  Marie is fucking in tears.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  She is crying.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  She's inconsolable.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  She is barely in our reality at this point.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  And this woman comes up to her and says,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  so did you kill her?
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  So was it an overdose?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  Are you drugs?
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  Yeah?
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Tell me how many drugs did you do today?
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  And she's like this.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  Right there.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  And Marie is just uncontrollably sobbing, telling her to fuck off as nice as she possibly can.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  But she's answering the question.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  She's like, no, of course not.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  Where's the cleaning supply?
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  Show me the cleaning.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  And the LAPD would not let her in the house.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  So that was good.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  They wanted this woman out there.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  Now, I have some footage of her screaming at Marie because the security camera did get a pretty good view of it.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  I have not gone through any yet because I've been going through all this other shit.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  I will do that later today.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  And I'll find out exactly what the fuck happened.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000]  Now, everything was fine.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  And the coroner, we had to wait for the coroner.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  And the coroner comes in and he's like, he comes in like a superstar.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  He's like, everyone's waiting for the coroner.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  He shows up.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  He's like, well dressed, well groomed.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  He's like, hey guys, I'm here.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  And I was like, OK, good.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  Interesting.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  He was like a personality, which was strange and interesting.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  And then the whole mood changed.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  And all suspicions toward me just sort of dissipated.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  And the guy did his job and he was very thorough.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  And he said, Val, here's the case number.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  Any questions you call me?
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  I'm sorry to tell you, but when people die, there's a blood barrier thing in your nose.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  And the blood drips out the nose.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  So there's blood on the bed.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  I was like, no, OK, it's disgusting.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  He said, you're probably going to want to get rid of the sheets.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  I was like, yes.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  They will take them for us.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  They can take the fucking sheets, man.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  But Saba, during this time, takes Marlowe and gives him to Steve
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  and decides that Marlowe cannot be with us.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  She makes this decision.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  She's screaming at Marie.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  Marie is inconsolable and she takes Marlowe.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  She does not tell Marie, OK, until later.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  And then Marlowe, and Marie comes to me, I'm inside talking to police officers.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  She took them.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  They took Marlowe.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  They took Marlowe.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  So I start running out there.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  I get to the fucking park and I see Marlowe and he's sitting down.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  I see Saba and they're going about to approach Marlowe.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  I see Steve behind her.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Just fucking.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  Steve's so sick, he's smiling.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  He's fucking grinning.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  He's fucking smiling.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  He's so happy about this shit.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  And I go there.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  I say, you're not taking Marlowe.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  No.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  You're not taking Marlowe.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  I get between her and Marlowe and I say, no.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Marlowe just come with me.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  He grabs my hand.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  OK.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  And Steve does not like this.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Saba is fucking upset.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  And she goes, it's like this.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  It makes me work hard.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  It's sort of the sigh.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  And then she walks over to the police officer and tells him something.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  He comes over.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  It's like, you have to release the child now.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  You have to let him go now.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  I don't even know who this woman is.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  She comes here.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  I don't even see a badge.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  I have no paperwork.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  I have this card with court date on it.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  OK.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  Nothing.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  Do you see a badge around her?
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  She's just a social worker.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  She's not a fucking officer.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  And the guy says, listen, you have to let go of the child now.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  So I'm like, OK.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  So Marlowe is going to be fine.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  We'll figure it out.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  Don't worry.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  Et cetera.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  Steve takes him off.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  Takes him away.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  And we haven't seen him since.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  Now, we get this fucking shitty lawyer.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  Here's a problem.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  Sorry.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  It's so convoluted.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  But I just want to make sure you got it.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  I want to be thorough.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Right?
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  I don't want to miss any details.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  This is important.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  Marie is so upset that she doesn't care a woman just died on the bed.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  She gets a blanket and just goes on the bed and sleeps.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  And I'm like, wow.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  I didn't think she had that in her.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  I was like, there's some coldness in her.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  I'm like, Marie, use that coldness.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Later I am.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  You've got to use that now.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  You cannot lose your shit like you did today with Saba.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  Because she was screaming and crying.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  And Marie's not a weak woman.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  But something happened at that moment.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  The woman really worked her.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  And then we immediately called this woman named Dorothy Gibbons White.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  And she is a lawyer that represented a famous friend of Marie's that was an NCIS actress named Zoe.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  And she did the most horrendous thing that he could do.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  But you know what?
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  She fucking fights dirty.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  She accused the husband of Zoe of being a child rapist.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  Like raping the son, Sebastian, every day for like a year or something.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  And I'm like, wow.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  Let's fuck that.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  And Marie's like, fuck that.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  I don't think it's true.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  I'm like, what?
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  And I'm like, I don't think it's true.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  Like really?
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  It's like, we've got to get this woman.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  You need to fucking hire her.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Because now we're so pissed off.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  We need someone to fight dirty.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Val: So we call her.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  And she says, you know, Sebastian got off.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  But he was held for four months in Kentucky.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  The police caught him trying to go across state lines.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  The FBI was involved.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  It's a thing.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  He really is this dirty.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  And we start to believe her more.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  And we want to believe her.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  Right?
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  Because we want her help.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  Because we know that she fights dirty.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  We want some of the fucking women.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  And I'm here at any cost.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Whatever the fucking cost is.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  We want Marlowe.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  You know?
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  And she starts saying, does Steve ever hang out with JP?
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  JP is the name of the guy that's this child rapist.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  And so he was the wife.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  So if you look at the internet, if you Google those two names,
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  you'll see the story.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  And as a matter of fact, Steve is friends with this guy, JP.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  And all gravitates around this fucking school called Lila.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  And the guy that's the head of that school is named Nordine.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  I filed a police report on him in May for being way too handsy
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  with Marie and all the women at that fucking school
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  and the children.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Because he is grabbing them, hugging them, everybody.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  He's very handsy.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  And it's a French thing to do.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  I get it.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  But we're not fucking French.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  All right?
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  And Marlowe doesn't like it.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  He does not like it when the guy grabs his fucking shoulder
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  all the time and rubs his back.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  He doesn't like it.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  And I tell Marlowe, well, tell him not to do it.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  You know?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  If I'd see him, I'll fucking tell him.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  But I've never seen him do it.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  Marlowe tells us.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  So I was pissed off.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  And on top of that, this guy says to Marie writes an email,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  Marie wants to have a meeting with the teacher
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  because we're worried about Marlowe's work
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  because he wasn't doing his math homework.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  He's lying to us about it.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  And she wanted to set up a meeting.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  And Nordine said, he's the head guy.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  Val: The guy that's too handsy says, Marie.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Fed: He's the principal?
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Val: He's the principal.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  Yeah.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  He says, Marie, I would go, but you have to go.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  I'll tell you when the meeting will be.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  And Steve is going to be there.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  And Marie says, I'm not.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  I can't be in a room with Steve.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  I do not want to be meeting with Steve.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  I'll do my own meeting.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  Steve can do
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  his own meeting.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  And then he says, and I shit you not, Marie,
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  if you don't go to the meeting with your husband,
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  I will call Child Services on you.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  In an email.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  And we have that email.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  OK.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  And then that's when I lose my shit.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  And I fucking call the police.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  I said, this guy's harassing us.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  He's being fucking handsy.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  He just threatened my girlfriend.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  And what he does with the kids is fucking strange.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  Now, take that completely unrelated.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  I had no idea that Dorothy Gibbons White, the prosecutor,
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  also had a file on this guy.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  Apparently, there is something fucking weird shit going on down there.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  How much of it is real?
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  I don't know.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  How much of it is fake?
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  I don't know.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  Because she is, again, fights dirty.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  But she blends fiction with fact, but she does it well.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  And I can't even fucking tell the truth anymore.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  So I don't care at this point.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Marie doesn't care.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  We're going to have to go to that level and accuse Steve
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  of hanging out with a known fucking kiddie fiddler.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Pedophile.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  If that's what's going to win, then let's just fucking do it.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  So she says, all right.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  But here she says, and I have, and I'm
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  happy if you guys want to take this further and go for it.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  Because I have, I recorded all of it.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  So you have her on tape saying to Marie,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  do you think Marlowe, could you get Marlowe to say this?
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  Could you get him to say this?
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  She's like, probably.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  This is what we need Marlowe to say.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  And Marlowe's eight.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  She's fucking saying that on the phone.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  She says, if I were you, it was my family,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  I would want Mike Kretzmer to represent me.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  It's like a mafia down there.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  But he's in the mafia, but he's like a spy.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  He's a good guy.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  I'm like, OK.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  So that's the guy we call.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  He immediately wants $15,000.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  And he is a fucking piece of work.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  And he's the worst lawyer I've ever fucking seen.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  He's the one that reached out to Jammy
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  and said he was representing me.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  All right.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  Val: No, there's one thing I missed.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  Fed: Did you pay him the $15,000?
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Val: No, we did not.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  No, not at all.
Fed: [Unintelligible]
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Fuck yeah.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  That's $700 an hour for three days of work.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  And what he did on Monday was nothing.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  He did not say a fucking, he did not defend us.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  He said, I don't even have to show up on the camera.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  OK.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Just Marie's going to sit there.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  So I set up this whole thing with lights,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Val: beautiful.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Fed: And you have to call him.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  Val: Yeah, you have to call him.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  And a proper camera with a proper lens.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  So she looked good.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  Like everyone else was looking good, right?
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  But the lawyer, no, he fucked up.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Sent us a link at the last second.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  And she had to do it from her phone.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  It looked terrible.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  And we were the only ones, or she was the only one
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  holding the phone.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Everyone else was at their computers.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  Well-dressed.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Everything looked good.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  And Marie's, we just looked unprepared.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  And clumsy and just, it was terrible.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  And the lawyer did not defend us.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  He did not say that none of this is true.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  He didn't say that Patille was crazy.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  He didn't say that Steve was using this as a tool for anything.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  He just said one thing.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  He said, all I ask is that the child is not sleeping
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  in the same bed as the father.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  And I say, oh shit, I know what he's going for.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  I know what he's building up, what he's going to build up to.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  But he doesn't defend us.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  And that's when I start losing, then I start texting him
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  and say, what are you doing?
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  You didn't put anything into evidence.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  You didn't mention anything about all these this litany of
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  things I've sent him.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  And he just screams at me and tells me,
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  I'm not listening to him.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  If I was a brain surgeon, would you tell a brain surgeon
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  what to do?
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  You know, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  Val: And then it was just-
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Fed: Did you submit a brief to the court?
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  Val: I don't know.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  We don't even have it.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  As far as I know, he submitted nothing.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  He said he didn't give the court anything.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  He just asked the lady, did you read the documents?
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  And she says, not yet, give me a few minutes.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  That's all I remember.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  And then she read the documents.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  And then she said, I want to see this guy Val.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  Because I'm painted out to be this controlling, fucking asshole
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  that is like, you know, Marie is too weak to speak for herself.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  And Marie is so fucking sick of hearing from men telling her
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  how weak she is that she needs another man to speak for her.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  Like, if you guys don't ever tell that to her,
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  because she's slacking.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  All right.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  But that's how she's painted out, not only by Steve,
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  but by everybody.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  All right.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  And now I am the controlling Svengali that is controlling her.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  For what purpose?
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  I don't know.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  You know, it's not like she has money.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  There's nothing I want.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  I'm trying to get for her.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  But apparently this is what I'm painted as.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  There's one more important thing after that.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  It's where I forget.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  It's really important.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  Lori, the woman, she took out the garbage once.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  Well actually more than one.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  But there was this one time, I think it was Saturday.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  Val: There were three of that.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  Fed: Lori's the one who passed away?
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  Val: Yes.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  Yes.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  But three different bags of black garbage.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  And I wasn't, this is told to me by Marie.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  It's the second hand.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  Marie will tell you the full story, much better than me.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  And Marie felt something was wrong.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  Something suspicious, because she was watching the bags
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  from upstairs, which she thought was great.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  So Marie said, I'll just take these bags out.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  And Marie and Lori was trying to tell her,
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  no, don't do it I'll do it.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  And she's like, no, that's okay.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  I'll take them out.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  And I think Marlowe goes with her.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  I don't remember.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  She goes outside.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  She opens the garbage.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  And in Garbage Bag A are my files from when
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  I was in Cook County, foster care.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  It's a stack of this big that I got when David was
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  doing my background.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  And so we got all this stuff from Cook County in Chicago.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  And it's a huge stack of papers of my whole,
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  entire childhood, in the misery of it all.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  Included in that is a notebook that I wrote in,
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  like poems and songs from when I was like 16 or 17.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  And there was another screenplay that was really
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  terrible, shitty screenplay, but I don't know
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  why she chose that.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  But you had to go to get this file.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  You had to know where they were.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  They were in my library.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  And you have to go and scrap them.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  It was not something that was accessible.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  Now bag number two was the same thing,
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  but for Marlowe.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  It was Marlowe's school assessments,
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  all the teacher assessments, all his grades,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  everything he's ever gotten from school.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  It's all in this one dossier sort of thing.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  In the third bag, there wasn't anything interesting.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  She said there was, there might have been something,
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  but not like this, something else.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  And so Marie flipped out, you know,
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  what this means.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  I still don't know what this means.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  Val: It's very strange.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  Fed: So she was taking out the trash,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  Fed: but it hadn't gone all the way yet?
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  Val: No.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  Well, she was going to steal it.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  So she was pretending, this is how she was going
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  to get the papers out in the garbage cans,
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  in the garbage bags, and then pretend that she was...
Fed: [Unintelligible]
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  Yes, yes, this stage.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  And that's why maybe she was going to her car all the time.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  And we found out that she did steal some shit from us,
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  which is funny enough, the Crystal Jewelry.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  I shit you not, dude. I shit you not.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  She stole the fucking Crystal Jewelry that Marlowe made.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  Yes.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  Okay.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000]  So that's the short version.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  Yeah?
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  Cleaning up.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  Cleaning up.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  Yeah, and then I got...
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Actually, yesterday, I got a text from Rocco,
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  who's the guy...
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000]  The film...
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  The film...
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  Yeah, the ex-Vice News guy.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  He said...
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  He did some background on Lori,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  and he said that she was...
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Rocco.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  Okay.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  "It's Lori Roth, date of birth, 1 17, 1960.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  She has an extensive criminal history,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  breaking and entering, distribution and trespassing.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  If your neighbor was watching Marlowe
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  and claiming he had bruises around the times,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  we were shooting, I can refute that with footage."
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  Okay, let's...
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  Yeah, she claimed that he had bruises and a black eye.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  That Marlowe had a fucking black eye.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  Never.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  Never.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  Never.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  Never.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  He never had bruises other than falling off his bicycle.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  Val: You know, his scraped knee.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Fed: What did the judge finally decide on Monday?
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  Val: The judge said...
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  The judge said, "okay, great.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  So, I want to see this Val person.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Can we please see Val?"
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  And so, he recalls me and I sit down.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  I don't say a word,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  because our lawyer says, don't talk.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  So, I listen to the lawyer.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  And she looks at me.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  There's a pause for like three or four seconds,
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  and she says, "I'm going to recommend
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  that the child does not see Val Broeksmit at all
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  and has minimum visits with the mother."
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  Minimum visits.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  Minimum.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  Like, the bare minimum that they have to...
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  The minimum.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  They could give away a few hours, three days a week.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  Val: You know?
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  Fed: Is there a deadline that expires
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  Fed: or when you go back to court?
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  Val: Nope.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  We had no paperwork.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  We did nothing.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  I had no paperwork from anyone.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  No one from fucking DCFS.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  From the courts.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  Val: Nothing.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Fed: Can you tell me on September 29th,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  Fed: you guys have the follow-up hearing
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  Fed: where they'll make a more firm decision?
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Fed: Or is that...
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Val: Yeah.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  So, on September 15th,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  I thought that was the court,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  that if it's not,
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  it's when the investigator has to hand in his paperwork.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  And then the next trial date is the 29th.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  And if there's no amicable decision made,
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  October 1st is the real trial,
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  like a trial trial,
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  where people will get witnesses,
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  Val: like the television or something.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  Fed: Okay.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  Val: So, yeah.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  So that's...
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  All right.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  The short version.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  It's pretty crazy.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  It's like the cop said,
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  he's like,
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  you got hit with a double wham.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  A double wham.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  And that's been stuck in my head ever since.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  He was very right.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  He was a double fucking triple wham.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  Sorry.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  Val: [Unintelligible] my language.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  Fed: How often does that film [unintelligible]
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  Val: Not often.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  Not anymore.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  So they've filmed...
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  So David Enrich,
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  you know,
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  he tried to get a film deal
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  during this whole thing,
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  very unethical,
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  and he held on to...
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  You probably don't want to hear any of this shit,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  but I'll tell you anyway,
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  because it's so fucking political.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  If you're like Tim and Jim,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  you don want to hear it.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  But Trump has these loans
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  with Deutsche Bank, right?
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  And David sat on them
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  for a very long time.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  And I'm like,
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  why did you sit on them?
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  He said,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  well, Deutsche Bank told me they were fake.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  I'm like, no.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  You listen to Deutsche Bank told me.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  He has a deal set up with Deutsche Bank.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  It's guy named Jurgen.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  I forgot his last name,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  but he's the head of the PR.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  It's a, you know,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  scratch on my back,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  I'll scratch yours.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  And for example,
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  with Tom Bowers,
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  remember Tom Bowers?
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Tom Bowers was
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Rosemary Vibraleck's boss
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  at DBTCA.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  Rosemary Vibraleck
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  was Trump's private banker
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  at Deutsche Bank.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  So he died.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  His death was very suspicious.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  It was suicide.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  He hung himself in Malibu.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  It was similar to my father.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  Very similar.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  And then the coroner,
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  there was a huge problem with the body.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  We couldn't get the police report
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  because the body had melted
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  mysteriously on Christmas Day
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  and they shipped it to Virginia
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  for some reason.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  And that's, so we can't,
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  it's cause of death,
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  no one can tell anyone.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  Very fucking weird, right?
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Of all the bodies in the world,
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  of all the deaths in the world,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  this is death.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  That is, no evidence.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  It's just fucking strange.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  And that was the last time
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  I spoke to Jim and Tammy as well.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  I bring up Tom Bowers
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  Val: because, why do I bring up Tom Bowers?
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Oh, because he knows about the loans, right?
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  That was David's source.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  And I know that because he told me the source.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  And then when he died,
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  David tweeted out,
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  it was a sad day,
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Tom Bowers died today.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  He said, he's a good man.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  He's got a family, sir.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  He left out the most important bit,
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  suicide, right?
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Because he has the deal with
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  Deutsche Bank.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  They said, do not imagine the suicide.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  So it was myself and Scott Steadman.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  I told Scott about it.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  And Scott is a,
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  he's like a Twitter,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  forensic news,
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  he runs this thing called forensic news.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  It's like a Twitter phenomenon.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  It's like 20 years old,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  he's got a million followers.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Because he handles
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  the Trump-Russia thing really well.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  So I tell him this story
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  and he gets on.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  He's a genius with public information.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  He finds anything in the public domain
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  and he gets the cause of death.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And then we do a story about the cause of death.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  And now we're in a battle against David.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  As I've always,
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  as I've been since that fucking article came up.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Sorry, that's,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  I don't know why
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  it felt that was important
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  Val: for you guys to know.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  Fed: So you said David was,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  Fed: you began by saying David was sitting on the,
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  Fed: sitting on the
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  Val: Yeah.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  Val: The Trump bill, you know.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  Fed: But then,
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  Fed: forensic news,
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Fed: did they have their own?
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  Fed: I mean, I guess the,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  Fed: the Deutch Bank of data,
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  Fed: seems like you shared it with Tim,
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Fed: with Tim and more?
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Val: I did.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  Val: I gave it to Tim and Jammy.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  Fed: And then,
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  Fed: David also had a copy of it.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  Val: No, I never,
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  I never gave David a full,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  I would never,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  I do not,
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  you know,
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  I gave him a doc,
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  Val: a selective amount of documents.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  Fed: But then,
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Fed: he's had the Trump data.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Val: No.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  Val: No, no, no.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  Fed: So how did,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  Fed: how did David know about it?
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Val: Tom Bowers
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Fed: Okay.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  Val: Now, if you remember,
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Val: there was a guy,
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  he's a pundit,
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  he's like a liberal-ish,
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  not Chris Matthews,
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  but,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  I can't remember his name.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  But he went on the air one,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  one night and said,
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  ladies and gentlemen breaking news,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  I have the Trump loan documents,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  from the Russian banks.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  And they are very well,
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  very much exactly what you thought,
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  you guys all thought.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Stay tuned,
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  et cetera, et cetera.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Next day,
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  he says,
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  ladies and gentlemen,
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  I have to retract my statement,
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  from the other night.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  I don't have them.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  Turns out they were fraudulent.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And so,
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  what the fuck.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  And Deutsche Bank's lawyer
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  has got ahold of this guy.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  He's a famous name,
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  I just can't,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  it's not coming to my mind.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  And told him that
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  these are fraudulent documents
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  and if you go,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  you're gonna fucking sue the shit out of you,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  you're never gonna work again.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  And that's what you got scared
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  and backed out.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  Now there are some fraudulent documents
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  out there,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  I've seen them on Scribd.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  They're terrible,
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  frauds,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  but these aren't the ones.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Val: These are different documents.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Fed: Fraudulent documents are more...
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  Val: Not in my data set.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Val: Not just Deutsche Bank.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Well,
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  my data set's grown substantially
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  since 2014,
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  but it's not from my data set.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  Fed: Please.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  Fed: It's like no one's talking about
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  Fed: the best way that we can help you.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  Fed: There's a couple options right now
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  Fed: that we already have to talk about a little bit
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  Fed: as far as the investigator goes, right?
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  Fed: What are the allegations against you?
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  Fed: I mean, I know we've talked about all of them,
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  Fed: but you have like some where you've,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  Fed: like if you see the lack of food
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  Fed: and you have cell phones everywhere.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  Val: Yeah, I don't really know what the allegations are,
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  Val: other than drug addicts.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  You know, but it's easy to call them drug addicts.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  I am very open about my past.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Right.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  You know, I've taken drugs.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Val: It's a big deal.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  Fed: You're not undergoing now,
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  Fed: because you said you know a drug test.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Val: Yes.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  Fed: So that should be,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Fed: that should probably solve itself, right?
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  Val: It should, but it doesn't.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  It didn't,
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  because then the,
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  our lawyer says just don't take any drug tests,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  don't talk to them if they call,
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  you hang up.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  If they're at the door,
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  you don't open it.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  Val: They're like, okay, fine.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  Fed: Why do you recommend that?
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  Val: I don't know.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  Well,
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  he's the lawyer.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  I just decided,
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  he knows more than me.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  So I trust him,
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  blindly,
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  until yesterday.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  MIke
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  Mike Kretzmer
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  so that's what I did.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  And that was stupid of me.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  Very fucking stupid of me.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And Marie did the same thing.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  And if I had not trusted him,
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  Val: Marie would not have trusted him.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  Fed: Does Marie also get a drug test
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  Fed: after her work you said?
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  Val: Yes,
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  Val: randomly.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  Val: Yes.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  Fed: I would imagine that.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Fed: It wouldn't be a huge issue,
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  Fed: because if Marie already got a drug test,
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  Fed: there would be one after the last.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Val: Right.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  And it's perfectly okay to go with your own doctor,
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  because you don't trust these DCF [sic] people
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  and give your own fucking drug test.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  You're overseen by doctor,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  and your doctor will hand it to you.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  That's fine too.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  I read it online.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  But the Saba woman would not allow that.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  She didn't want that.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  And I also said,
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  no,
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  Saba,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  and I have it on the tape.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Saba,
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  I said I was willing to take a drug test.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  I didn't say I was going to be there
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  at 3.30
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  and Beverly Hills
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  on fucking Friday.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  That I did not say.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  It was,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  well,
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  you know that if you don't take a test,
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  it's going to,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  that means that you are called,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  quote, dirty,
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  they call it.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  Well,
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  that's a,
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  well,
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  you know that's a bunch of bullshit.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  It's a lie.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Why would you do that?
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  Val: That's just the way it is.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Fed: Can she get what you want
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  Fed: in Beverly Hills?
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  Val: She said anytime between nine
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  and five
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  on a Friday,
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  on Friday,
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  yes,
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  in Beverly Hills.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  Okay.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  And then I was,
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  we're both ready to go
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  until Thursday night
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  before police come.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  Okay.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  And then we're pissed off.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Val: And we're like,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  Val: you know what? That's enough
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  Fed: I'd help that Mike
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Fed: recommend not.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  Val: Yes.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  Yes.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  So it's like,
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  you know,
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  we weren't even supposed to call her
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  and say no,
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  we're just,
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  but we picked up the phone
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  or stupidly even talked to her.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  But this woman is,
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  it's like,
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  something's wrong.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  Something's really wrong.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  We don't know what it is.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  I know what I don't know,
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  which is a substantial.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  Are you guys,
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  do you guys know anything even,
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  that I don't know?
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  What can you help me with this?
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  Val: What is happening?
Fed:[Asks something]
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  Val: I don't know.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  I have no idea.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  No one's told me anything.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  Even Mike,
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  the lawyer is supposed to be
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  the greatest ever.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  He doesn't,
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  he told me shit.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  We fired him.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  That's right.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  Val: Interesting.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Fed: Do you guys have things
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  Fed: for another lawyer?
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  Val: Well,
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  that's what I was going to find
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  out today.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  See what you guys can do.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  And if you could save us,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  If you could save us,
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  you know,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  $15,000,
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  it would be great.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  But I'm trying,
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  I have to gauge what you can do
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  to see if I need a lawyer.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  That's why I'm
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  making this right now.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  So not only you're gauging me,
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  Val: but I'm gauging you.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  Fed: It's a tough call.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  Fed: Like,
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  Fed: we're not going to send
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  Fed: an FBI lawyer to represent me.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  Val: Right.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  Fed: The things we can do,
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Fed: I mean,
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  Fed: if there's a question of money,
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  Fed: sometimes we can
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Fed: get you some money.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  Fed: But obviously I can't.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  Val: We have,
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.040]  Val: You know, obviously, we're not wealthy, but we can do this.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.440]  Fed: Yeah, remember what you were saying,
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.160]  Fed: and I mean, you do well for yourself.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.560]  Fed: You said trade didn't end one time.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.960]  Val: Yeah, I mean, I've lost more than you made, but yeah, I got it.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:16.160]  Val: You know, don't tell, don't tell Marie.
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.160]  Fed: You're doing the last few more.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:24.000]  Val: Actually, that's probably my best, when crisis, time, and crisis.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.920]  Fed: So there's that type of stuff.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.360]  Fed: The other thing that we talked about, too, is we have to keep
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.600]  Fed: our relationship secret.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.680]  Fed: Yeah, that's the only way that we can do it.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.320]  Fed: So if, you know, I call a shop, stop, or something like that,
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:39.880]  Fed: and say, hey, we've got the deal, so we'll tell you why you want to know.
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:40.240]  Val: Sure.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.320]  Fed: [Unintelligible]
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.840]  Fed: So our relationship with you is going to be limited in scope, right?
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.560]  Fed: Like we talked about, it's likely going to be something where, you know,
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.320]  Fed: it's going to be something.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.840]  Val: You know, I look at electronic cigarette thing, I just can't believe it.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.800]  Are you going to know all this smoke, electronic?
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.720]  Really? Inside?
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.520]  Val: It's just, but it's not real.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.680]  Fed: I'm not aware of it.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:08.240]  Fed: So the main thing that we would call it, the main thing that we would be able to
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.040]  Fed: help with is, like, everything's going well, right?
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.120]  Fed: We can't change what's going on in the past, right?
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:17.440]  Fed: Because we can't change what, you know, Saba said, or what your neighbors have
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.240]  Fed: said, or anything.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.440]  Val: Sure, right.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.040]  Fed: But going forward, we can help you with the investigator, right?
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.640]  Fed: Because the investigator is going to assess you and Marie to see if you
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.920]  Fed: get the two full parents.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.960]  Fed: So those are things that we can help with.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.800]  Fed: I'm trying to think there are other avenues that would like you.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.920]  Val: I made a whole list of stuff.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.160]  Val: I've been studying law for like a week, okay?
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.200]  I'm not a lawyer, but I figured there's some things that they've done very
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.720]  illegally, all right?
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.120]  Due process still exists, even in that court, all right?
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.920]  Even though some lawyers say no, some lawyers say yes, it does exist.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:53.080]  We read online on reputable law websites.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.200]  They're not supposed to invite themselves in and walk in.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.720]  They did.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:07.240]  This woman is clearly, the lies are so ridiculously, too many lies.
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:14.000]  And the only reason for that is to paint a picture because you have an agenda.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.800]  Why, why she has this agenda?
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.920]  Why she wants to destroy me or Marie?
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.840]  I don't know, I mean, I get it.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.240]  I've encountered people like this before.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.640]  I don't know why they do it, but they want to do it.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.640]  It's either, Marie always says I'm going to kill this, you know?
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.160]  I don't think it's jealousy.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.200]  I think it's something else.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.520]  I don't know what it is, but there's some reason that she wants us destroyed.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:41.920]  And she, and you have to, what I've learned is that this system,
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:45.520]  just the DCFS, is very corrupt.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.200]  There's some, they know each other.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.640]  It's incestual, they all know each other.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:55.280]  This guy that worked there, our lawyer and Kretzmer, he was threatening Marie.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.000]  Okay, when we left, he fucking threatened her and said, you know what?
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.560]  If you don't get Val, because I was calling him out, I said, why didn't you do this?
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.440]  If you don't get a Val to stop acting like a bully and know everything,
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.600]  you're going to have to make a choice between your son and Val.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.560]  We have that on tape, too.
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.560]  You got to hear this fucking, too.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.560]  Val: It's crazy.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.320]  Fed: Okay.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:22.520]  Fed: Full soldier, too, I've dealt with this and other cases that are similar to yours.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.400]  Val: With DCFS?
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.600]  Val: With DCFS?
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600]  Fed: In Texas.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.600]  Val: Oh, okay.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.600]  Fed: Similar organizations.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.440]  Fed: But we don't, the thing is, I'm not an expert either, right?
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.200]  Fed: We've worked with some things in the past that have been successful stuff,
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.200]  Fed: and we actually got some good work out of it.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.560]  Fed: Everything turned out fine.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.960]  Fed: So that's my experience with it.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.080]  Fed: I'm not an expert in custody law and how processes work,
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.200]  Fed: I learn something new every day.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:53.320]  Fed: So the primary issue I see is this, like, if we're going to help, right,
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:58.120]  Fed: we're going to help and be effective in our job, but also be effective for you.
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:05.400]  Fed: So trying to uncover a conspiracy with Saba makes it, like, I mean,
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.120]  Fed: I don't think there's some weird stuff going on, but that's what I'm saying is that
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.080]  Fed: if the investigator does his job properly or her job properly,
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.600]  Fed: they should see that you guys are successful parents who can help raise Marlowe
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.000]  Fed: in a very productive way.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.280]  Val: But here's the thing.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.560]  Val: Any competent person, whether you're a DCFS or a police officer,
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.960]  anyone that is trained to deal with people,
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.200]  can delineate a same person from an insane person, right?
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.840]  You should be able to do that.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:41.400]  Now, when you meet Pattil and you read her shit, she's obviously fucking nuts, right?
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:44.160]  Sorry for this, but clinical terms, she's fucking nuts.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.320]  She's out there.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:51.760]  And for Saba, I know is able to determine the difference between saying and not saying.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.440]  So she purposely, I suspect that she's a smart person,
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.960]  that she purposely included this woman's testimony for a reason.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.680]  She's against it, because she must know that she's fucking nuts.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:05.680]  They're using her.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:08.360]  It's sad for this woman.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.640]  I'm not that sympathetic for her anymore because she's did it, but it's, you know what I mean?
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.600]  I'm not saying it's very simple.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.920]  Val: It's the first time I've heard it.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:19.680]  Fed: So you're saying that she's clinically insane, right?
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.600]  Fed: She's got severe bipolar.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.320]  Val: Maybe not insane, but that's exaggeration.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.240]  Val: Mentally unstable, for sure.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.120]  Val: Classic bipolar.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.240]  Val: I'm willing to bet you anything you'll find bipolar medication.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.840]  Fed: But just for reference, right?
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.560]  Fed: We probably wouldn't want to make that claim, right?
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.920]  Val: You would, yes.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.360]  Val: Or you would not.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:44.040]  Fed: Because if it's one, easy to tell that someone is clinically insane, and two,
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.280]  Fed: you know that she's insane, and three, why would you give custody to her
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.960]  Fed: for several hours a week?
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.000]  Val: Because we didn't know it at the time.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.840]  Fed: It just hurt yourself, right?
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.800]  Fed: So like, you know at the time, he's same argument to the lady with the investigation.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.880]  Fed: So that's an avenue I think would be dangerous for you than anything else, right?
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:04.560]  Val: So we get her to retract her statement.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.240]  Fed: Well, here's the thing.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:10.120]  Fed: So again, are we going to go over there and break her off to retract the statement?
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.520]  Val: Yeah, I'm ready to go to the Armenian.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.920]  Val: I'm like, let's go find the Armenians.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.040]  Val: They handle this shit, right?
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.560]  Fed: Luckily, we're lucky for you.
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.200]  Fed: The FBI doesn't do that, right?
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:25.520]  Fed: I mean, we are on the side of good because we're not going to influence people in that way.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.480]  Fed: It's just not how we work.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:29.080]  Fed: And like I told you on phone, I'll be honest with you.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.480]  Fed: What we can and what we can't do, I'm not going to make a story for you to say like,
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.640]  Fed: oh, we can turn the world around immediately for you right now.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.440]  Val: No, I know.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:36.960]  Val: I know.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.800]  Val: I don't expect that.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.880]  Fed: But I'm trying to work with you to see what avenues we can best help with.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.720]  Fed: So like I said, the best thing I can think of right now is influencing how you're perceived.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.360]  Fed: And not in a negative way, not in a way that's illegal or anything, but just saying like,
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.760]  Fed: hey, if you have these issues, if you have, they say, oh, there's not enough food in the house.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:04.040]  Fed: And then we just show receipts, you get an Amazon delivery every week or something like that.
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.720]  Val: Yeah, we have the receipts.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.920]  Fed: So all those things would be easily refuted by evidence that you can show.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.520]  Fed: And there's no evidence that the FBI is helping you or, you know, if we give you money to do that,
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.920]  Fed: that's just cash that you have, right?
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.920]  Fed: So all those things are ways that we can help your view in the courts eyes.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:27.720]  Fed: Because what we talked about too and what we talked about on the phone is that it's very rare
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:30.680]  Fed: that they take custody completely away from the parent.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:35.080]  Fed: It can happen in very extreme cases, but at least the ones that I've been involved in,
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.960]  Fed: the judge almost always favors.
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.640]  Fed: And what we talked about, the mom almost wouldn't have a father or whatever.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.400]  Val: I believe that you believe that.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.920]  But what I've read and studied in the last few days about this specific system in Los Angeles
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.640]  and these people, it's not that.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.560]  It's the opposite.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.920]  They give it to the perpetrator.
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:56.760]  They give it to the person that has the most money or the person that's been doing the illegal fake calls.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:02.560]  Because this is, obviously you can imagine, this is a tool used in many, many divorces.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.400]  Fed: That's the complicated part of it.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:10.000]  Fed: And I have not experienced in this, but just, you know, you've had an experience in the past
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.160]  Fed: and you've been like, this is complicated.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.320]  Fed: It's not just a child welfare situation, it's a divorce.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320]  Val: It's weaponized.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.160]  Val: They weaponized DCFS for divorce.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.960]  It's terrible, but that's what's happening.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:22.760]  And they know it.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.760]  And they're using it and making a lot of money.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:27.160]  They're fucking lawyers and judges.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:32.160]  Like, for example, Saba makes $120,000 a year.
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.280]  Her supervisor makes 210 public records.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.480]  That's a lot of money for DCFS, right?
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.480]  And they have the other $80,000.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.520]  What's other?
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.760]  Where did that $80,000 come from?
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.920]  Over time.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920]  $60,000.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.040]  Over time.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.800]  And $25,000.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.960]  Other $90,000.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.360]  So what the fuck?
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.800]  Is that normal?
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.800]  I don't know, okay.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.240]  Anyway, I'm just saying it's suspicious to me.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.600]  But yeah, well, what can you do?
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.800]  What can you do?
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.000]  Val: What is in your power and what's not?
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.880]  Fed: We have to do some more research, because the issue is what we can do would make it
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.440]  Fed: over it also, right?
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.920]  Val: Also, you don't have a rebuttal either.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:21.320]  We wrote it on the piece of paper, the FPVF thing with like these, then we put sticky
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:24.840]  notes on the fake sticky notes on a digital thing.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.360]  Can't find it anywhere.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.200]  It only took two days to write it, and now we can't find the sticky notes.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:31.200]  We have to write it again.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.200]  So we will get you that.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.200]  We will get you that.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.800]  And I haven't uploaded all the evidence yet, like all the recordings that we have and
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:47.280]  Val: all the video recordings, audio and video.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:54.040]  Fed: So, the last time I checked the email address, I didn't see anything, but that was before
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.040]  Fed: I left.
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.040]  Val: You didn't see anything?
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.040]  Fed: No.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.040]  Val: I sent it to you.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:02.400]  Fed: I checked that email address on Sunday night, and I checked on Monday to get anything
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.400]  Fed: yet.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.480]  Val: But you don't, this should be, I sent you like a shitload of stuff last night, last night.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480]  Fed: Oh, last night?
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480]  Val: Yeah.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.480]  Fed: Okay.
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.480]  Fed: I haven't checked it.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.480]  Val: Oh, okay.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480]  Fed: Because I haven't been flying in here.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.480]  Val: It's okay.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:16.480]  Val: I sent you the text saying, I'm sorry, I just saw this now.
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:17.480]  Fed: Yeah.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.480]  Fed: That's what I'm saying.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480]  Fed: Yeah.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.480]  Fed: I haven't checked whatever it is you sent.
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480]  Val: Okay, good.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.480]  Okay.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.480]  You've got a lot, there's a lot of reading in there.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480]  You'll see.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.480]  Val: But you've read the report, though.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:30.480]  Fed: I don't have, if you sent the report in that group, I haven't read it yet.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:31.480]  Val: The good report?
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.480]  Fed: No.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.480]  Fed: So, yeah, I just have a good report.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480]  Val: Oh, good.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.480]  Okay.
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:36.480]  So, you sort of, oh, good.
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.480]  I got to you first.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.480]  That's good.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.480]  So, you get your first impression from me first.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.480]  Not that report.
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.480]  That's a good sign for me.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480]  Very happy to hear that.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.480]  Val: That's good.
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:48.480]  Fed: So, we can do some more research on our side, see what thing you have.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.480]  Val: Good.
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.480]  Fed: I can't promise anything else, but I cannot promise my own right.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.480]  Fed: Like, I can't promise that I mean you don't need all of that help at all.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480]  Val: That's good to me.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.480]  Fed: But I can't tell you I'll be honest, right?
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.480]  Fed: I'll be honest with you about what we can do and what we can't do.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:02.480]  Fed: And, I'll give you some options sometimes and say, well, we can try this and try that.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:05.480]  Fed: It may include to different ways.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.480]  Fed: But I can't promise what I promise what we can do.
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.480]  Val: I got that.
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:12.480]  Val: Um, Look, what do you want if you want it?
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:19.960]  Fed: What did you have on there that you wanted to show up?
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:22.080]  Val: Seriously, it will be here all week.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.000]  Fed: OK, can you even find it in summary,
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.520]  Fed: like the overview of what you see?

[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.000]  Val: Do you like political shit?
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.280]  Val: Or do you like give me a genre?
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.200]  Fed: I work in cyber crime.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.040]  Val: Oh, you do?
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.840]  Val: OK, that's what I thought.
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.600]  Fed: You read it on that article, I know.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.080]  Fed: So you're going to do that part, right?
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.520]  Fed: So I work in cyber crime.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.800]  Fed: So we look for hackers.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.360]  Fed: We do ransomware, or BTC, and [unintelligible]jacking.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.360]  Val: Oh, you do?
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.360]  Val: Really?
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.160]  Fed: Yeah, we do a bunch of other stuff, like computer issues in general.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:55.640]  Fed: I do some stalking pieces.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.120]  Val: Do you have all the toys and tech shit, too?
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.440]  Fed: I've got a lot of toys.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.200]  Val: Oh, really?
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.000]  Val: OK.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:01.520]  Fed: But yeah.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.800]  Val: Dude, OK.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.720]  Val: Do you need like an apprentice?
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.720]  Fed: All right.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.320]  Fed: Do you want to come out to QC and see all the toys we have?
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:13.640]  Fed: In our hand presses, and then you ask the whole band to give them out.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.040]  Val: Well, yeah, OK.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.600]  Val: OK, yeah, well, I can help you.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:18.880]  Val: I'm a self-taught hacker.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:19.840]  Val: I'm not very good.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.480]  Val: I did not hack Sony, OK?
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.640]  Val: I did not do that.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.240]  Val: They was accused of that, [sic] but I did not do that.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.080]  Val: The stuff on DDoS Secrets, I was stupid enough to say,
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:33.280]  Val: Emma, can you actually give me credit for my stuff?
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.400]  Val: Can you put my name?
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.880]  Val: I'm the only idiot that said, here, put my name on it.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.800]  Val: But MPS, Monty Duposky, that was not a hack of the documents
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.000]  Val: were given to me by the Anatella Rossi.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.320]  Val: So it was not a hack.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:50.840]  Val: And she said, I want you to make this public as possible,
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.320]  Val: because we need David Rossi's story out there.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.480]  Val: So I said, of course.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.960]  Val: And she knew I had connections with New York Times,
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.760]  Val: and most journals, and that's what she wanted.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.680]  Val: So I helped her, and Luca was her lawyer.
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.560]  Val: It seems like a very, like you walk in one light bulb
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:10.600]  Val: on this old ancient desk, smoking a cigarette,
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:15.720]  Val: speaking Italian, perfect cliche of a lawyer.
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.760]  Val: He also wanted all this everywhere.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.280]  Val: He wanted me to disseminate as much as I could.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:22.600]  Val: We had a deal.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.960]  Val: I said, if you can give me anything on McKaylee Faisola,
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.560]  Val: anything on my father, anything you got,
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.120]  Val: I'll give you whatever I have.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.200]  Val: And I don't really, let's look for David Rossi.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.200]  Val: I don't have much in here.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.320]  Val: If you want to do it, you can do it right now.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.520]  Val: So that was our trade.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:39.400]  Val: And man, I told you in town, but he told me
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:42.040]  Val: the craziest fucking story.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:44.680]  Val: It'll take a long time to tell you the story.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.040]  Val: The short version is that Monty Duposky, the Calabria mafia,
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:54.560]  Val: is using MPS to launder their money.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.120]  Val: And they're using it in very interesting and creative ways,
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.520]  Val: like putting cash in basketballs for the Italian basketball
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.080]  Val: team.
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.400]  Val: Literally, they'll have basketballs filled with cash.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:09.600]  Val: And then they give the basketballs to some other team.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.520]  Val: They trade them with other basketballs.
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.280]  Val: And that's how they do the cash exchange.
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.440]  Val: Fucking weird.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.920]  Val: I swear to God.
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.440]  Val: And we've got David Rossi.
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:19.800]  Val: And Anatella says this happened.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.120]  Val: And Luca says this is what happened.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.760]  Val: David Rossi would pick up just a briefcase full of cash.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:26.440]  Val: He'd rent a car.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.640]  Val: He would drive from Siena to Lugano.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.600]  Val: And he would just start dumping cash into different accounts.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.640]  Val: And then one guy that picked up the cash count
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:42.840]  Val: is Cardinal Scorano from the Vatican, caught on CCTV.
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:43.800]  Val: And he's laundering money.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:46.960]  Val: He's got a history of being a dirty banker as well.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.040]  Val: So this is very interesting.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.480]  Val: But no one's gone after him the second time.
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:51.920]  Fed: He's got to go.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.960]  Fed: Or has to mention that he doesn't go.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.240]  Fed: Both of them.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.600]  Fed: And how do you know what to tell him?
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.640]  Val: I went over and then visited her.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.320]  Val: When I was a, it's a really, it's another story
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:06.040]  Val: if you want to have a story time.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:09.680]  Val: But I was trapped in Amsterdam.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.760]  Val: Like literally trapped in a fucking campsite.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.240]  Val: Someone broke into my rental car and stole,
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:19.120]  Val: like I had this computer in black case, Macbook,
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.840]  Val: and it was underneath the passenger seat.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.600]  Val: And it's the dead of night in Amsterdam.
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.000]  Val: Like 3 AM, I'm going into town and I buy some cigarettes.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.080]  Val: So I leave the car for a little, maybe 10 minutes.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.240]  Val: And I walk back and cobblestone streets and I see glass.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.840]  Val: I say, oh, poor fucker, guys, car broke in.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:36.880]  Val: It's mine.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.800]  Val: No, they did not take my passport.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:42.560]  Val: They did not take my 30 or 40 euros.
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.040]  Val: You know, sitting in that little tray between the passenger
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.120]  Val: and the driver's side.
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.200]  Val: They didn't take my fender strad in the back seat
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.400]  Val: or anything else.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.480]  Val: They only took that computer, which I have a dutch bank
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:55.840]  Val: stuff that I had just bought in New York City
[01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:57.400]  Val: a month and a half prior.
[01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:00.680]  Val: And I just organized all my dutch bank shit,
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.240]  Val: all the files on that computer.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.080]  Val: It was encrypted.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.720]  Val: There's no way anyone can get to it.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.520]  Val: And anyone that would pull off something like that,
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.360]  Val: it's got to be a shitty private investigator.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.760]  Val: There's no, anyone that's sophisticated
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:12.800]  Val: would have just fucking hacked it, you know,
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.600]  Val: or given up on anyone saying it was encrypted.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.440]  Val: There's no way in.
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.640]  Val: It was air gap, I forgot to say.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:17.480]  Val: There's no way.
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:20.080]  Val: But that's the only thing that was taken.
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.240]  Val: And I suspect Deutsche Bank hired a private investigator.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:24.640]  Val: That's what I think.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.000]  Val: In Prague, I thought I was gonna die
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.560]  Val: when this guy, Italian thug, pulls me out of the car
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.000]  Val: and starts beating on me.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:38.040]  Val: And he doesn't speak a word of English.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.440]  Val: I just came to buy some car to the mall in Czechoslovakia.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.920]  Val: Have you ever been to a mall in Prague?
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.400]  Val: It's fucking weird.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.480]  Val: It's a weird place.
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:47.720]  Fed: I once rode on a train.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.880]  Val: Oh, in Prague?
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.200]  Val: What happened?
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.040]  Fed: I got to get off.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:51.880]  Val: No, no.
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.440]  Fed: I ended up in a train.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.280]  Val: That's not good.
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.600]  Fed: It was not good.
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.880]  Fed: No, it was like, it was bad.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.120]  Val: Yeah, I hit the SOS button in the car, like,
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.520]  Val: help, I'm being murdered.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.800]  Val: This guy's gonna murder me.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.320]  Val: And I forgot, I had bought a fake gun,
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.880]  Val: like a BB gun in Germany.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.840]  Val: And I never, I don't know anything about guns,
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.560]  Val: but I should have used it.
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.800]  Val: Maybe he would have run away,
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.080]  Val: but I forgot it was in the fucking apartment.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.320]  Val: So instead I'm just like, I use my phone.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.320]  Val: Look, you're on camera.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.600]  Val: Stop kicking me, stop this.
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.160]  Val: You're being on camera.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.720]  Val: And the SOS, hears it all.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.040]  Val: And next thing I know, the fucking SWAT teams.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.120]  Val: They got machine guns, there's six of them.
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.160]  Val: And they surround us, and they tell the guy,
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.800]  Val: he has fucking hands up, and I'm like,
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:34.400]  Val: that's the guy, we know that's the guy.
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.520]  Val: They're speaking English.
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.160]  Val: And then the dude does the strangest thing.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:42.720]  Val: He's surrounded by the SWAT team, with M16s,
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:44.400]  Val: wherever those big guns are.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.680]  Val: He takes off his shirt, so you can see he's topless, right?
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.920]  Val: Why does he take off his shirt?
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.160]  Val: Cause he's got military tattoos.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.240]  Val: This is how he's going to communicate to the Czech police
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:55.640]  Val: that I'm one of you.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.920]  Val: That's what he did [unintelligible]
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.680]  Val: at the EU military, some sort of service.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.240]  Val: And they put down the gun, it works.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:04.320]  Val: They're like, what is going on here?
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.120]  Val: Turns out, we take over the police station,
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:11.800]  Val: and like a fucking lady from a central casting,
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.680]  Val: Interpol, shows up, you know?
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:16.640]  Val: He's like, I don't want to be here in a sunday or anything.
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:19.920]  Val: Get me, who's this stupid American, you know, sorry.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:21.440]  Val: Turns out he's from Avis rental car,
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.720]  Val: and he just came to repo the car.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.960]  Val: That's the fucking crazy shit that it was, man.
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.840]  Val: It was a weird time, you know?
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.960]  Val: I don't know why I told you that story, but it's fine.
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.480]  Val: What was the question?
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.320]  Val: Sorry.
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.160]  Fed: Let's go back to your hacking system.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:35.000]  Val: Oh, hacking?
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:35.840]  Val: Yes.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.720]  Fed: What kind of skills do you know,
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:38.920]  Fed: what kind of techniques do you know?
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.160]  Val: Well, I guess my, the only one I pulled off,
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.960]  Val: like really successfully was my mother.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:48.160]  Val: But we had a lot of time in planning, though.
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.320]  Val: It was just a man in the middle of watching my hack.
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:51.200]  Val: It was really easy.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.480]  Fed: Was it a Wi-Fi fan app or something?
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.920]  Val: I have a pineapple, but I did not use a pineapple.
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.800]  Val: I could not, I was like, I had no money, I had nothing.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.760]  Val: I had to learn how to increase the output of my battery
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.920]  Val: power on the MacBook to handle all the fucking thoroughfare
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.720]  Val: that was coming in through the,
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.640]  Val: well, I had practiced at this hotel down there.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:12.720]  Val: They called the, in Venice Beach,
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.960]  Val: but it was a, I spoofed their,
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:22.560]  Val: it's in Manhattan Beach,
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.240]  Val: and it was where I learned everything for two weeks.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.720]  Val: Anyway, I spoofed the router,
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.800]  Val: and I learned Wireshark at that time,
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.400]  Val: which was like driving me crazy
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.920]  Val: because all I got were the packets,
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.280]  Val: but I could not figure out how to put the packets together
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:38.360]  Val: and took me, like, maybe I'm slow, I don't know,
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:39.560]  Val: but it took me a while to figure out
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.040]  Val: how to put the fucking packets together.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.440]  Val: And once I did, I was like, shit, I have passwords now.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.160]  Val: I have some, well, not full passwords,
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.440]  Val: they're still broken up,
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:51.920]  Val: but you can just put them into a algorithm that will,
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:56.240]  Val: yeah, John the Ripper or something,
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.600]  Val: anything that's, actually, John the Ripper won't work,
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.200]  Val: it's more like a, I don't know, it's,
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.640]  Val: Sorry?
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.800]  Fed: Rainbow table?
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.520]  Val: No, the table one, that's not very easy one,
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:11.440]  Val: the table hack, that's the injection one,
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.080]  Val: were you in KaliLinux, you're talking about?
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.320]  Fed: Yeah, it's been a long time since I took that class,
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.520]  Fed: but I thought you're just running it
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.040]  Fed: against a dictionary or something?
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.600]  Val: Yeah, well, you are, but you also had an algorithm
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.200]  Val: that's specific to what you're looking for.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.360]  Val: Like, I knew my mom's,
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:29.120]  Val: my mom would have a very specific list
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.400]  Val: of names she would use, right?
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.440]  Val: So I had to plug in just those,
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.400]  Val: and I had to have the, you know,
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.320]  Val: anything over eight fucking,
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.360]  Val: it's good we can talk a little bit, this is fun,
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.000]  Val: anything over eight letters is gonna take over
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.760]  Val: a day and a half, unless you have a 20 gig GEX,
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.680]  Val: whatever, NVIDIA card, you know,
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.240]  Val: that's with Elcomsoft, which is the fastest
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.160]  Val: password cracker I've seen so far right now,
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:54.320]  Val: on the market, I'm sure you guys
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.960]  Val: probably have access to something cooler than that,
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.400]  Val: but it takes a long time.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.400]  Val: But it's a lot of it, you just have to use your intuition
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:03.480]  Val: or make a phone call, you know, I didn't say you,
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:06.800]  Val: you know, that's the best way to do it is this,
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:09.960]  Val: they call it social engineering,
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:13.360]  Val: so that's the most fun way to do it.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.680]  Fed: How do you learn, like, do you take classes?
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:17.880]  Fed: You too, we don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:22.120]  Val: I was, you don't understand, my dad just killed himself,
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.200]  Val: my mom cut me out of the family,
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:28.920]  Val: I was sequestered to rehab, it was a very nice rehab,
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:32.040]  Val: but I was not free, I was like, for four months,
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.520]  Val: I'd say that.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.640]  Fed: You're a whole lot more than me,
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.920]  Fed: I've taken the classes that you and I,
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:38.680]  Fed: I don't understand everything.
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:42.280]  Val: But I had to, it was like, if you have no money
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:43.480]  Val: and you have to feed yourself
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.960]  Val: and someone throws you in a foreign country,
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.360]  Val: you're gonna learn, you know, that's what it was for me,
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.240]  Val: it was like, I had to know why my dad killed himself,
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:51.760]  Val: I had to figure it out, I had to get into his email,
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.720]  Val: so I just sat down and fucking focused.
[02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.600]  Val: I was impressed, I was like,
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:57.760]  Val: I was planning on killing myself,
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:00.120]  Val: you know what, maybe my mom will learn something
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:01.600]  Val: if I die the same year, you know,
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:03.160]  Val: maybe my sister will never have the stuff,
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:04.800]  Val: I was being a martyr, you know,
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.440]  Val: I was being a little shit too, being an asshole.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.480]  Val: And the doctor said, you know what Val,
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.920]  Val: we're gonna try and give you adderall,
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:15.080]  Val: let's see what this does, what the fuck that was like.
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:17.440]  Val: You know, and then I take it, I'm playing,
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.000]  Val: three hours like that.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.200]  Val: All right, let's learn hacking, you know,
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.320]  Val: finance is next.
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:24.880]  Val: And you know what, it fucking saved my life that thing,
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:26.400]  Val: it really did, I drugged,
[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:27.560]  Val: and people say don't do drugs,
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.960]  Val: but sometimes drugs really work, it shows you.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.840]  Val: Yeah, if you're depressed, you don't see any hope,
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.720]  Val: sometimes the drug will just give you a glimpse
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.800]  Val: and remind you that there is another way
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:42.240]  Val: of viewing the world, you know, that's it.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:44.280]  Val: But anyway, yeah, I was fueled with adderall,
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.320]  Val: it was very helpful.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:50.040]  Val: Yeah, I found focus, I never, like I was a dumb musician,
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.400]  Val: I thought I had, there's no way I was gonna learn
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.440]  Val: how a derivative work, right?
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:57.040]  Val: I had no fucking, I was very proud of myself,
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.600]  Val: and I thought my father was very proud too,
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:01.320]  Val: and that's kind of another thing, kind of,
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.960]  Val: you know, a little fuel, a fuel to the fire.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:08.000]  Fed: So what other things really need to happen?
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.960]  Fed: Like, do you know anything about ransomware?
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:14.480]  Val: I do, yeah, I stay away from it, it sounds,
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:16.160]  Val: I mean, it sounds like it's really,
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.960]  Val: it's not, I mean, I've never had anything around somewhere,
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:22.160]  Val: but it doesn't seem like a difficult thing to break,
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:24.200]  Val: I mean, it's gotta be localized on the computer
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:26.480]  Val: and you can isolate it, it's not,
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.080]  Val: if you take the computer offline,
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:30.720]  Val: it's not like a self-destruct button
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:34.800]  Val: that where all of a sudden your computer's gone dead,
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.120]  Val: you can isolate the fucking hack.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.360]  Val: It's just like anything, you know, any virus.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.640]  Val: Well, not like any virus, I don't know much about it,
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.560]  Val: but if someone's putting a foreign code
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.440]  Val: onto your computer, it's depending where it is,
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:48.200]  Val: and again, remember, there's different types,
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.640]  Val: and with Intel, the new shit we learned about Intel,
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:53.880]  Val: with the hack on the chips, there's a whole new,
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:57.720]  Val: it's like a whole new industry, but there's a whole new,
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:02.440]  Val: what's the word, like a way to get at data,
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.560]  Val: I can't remember the names of them
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.920]  Val: because it's, my brain's not 100% today,
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.720]  Val: but the ones, the Intel chips, the flaws
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.000]  Val: that were found about a year and a half ago,
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.120]  Val: do you remember what you know what I'm talking about?
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:13.960]  Fed: The vulnerability, thank you.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:14.800]  Val: What's it called?
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.640]  Fed: Vulnerability?
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:17.480]  Fed: Yeah, but what were the names of the ghost one?
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:18.600]  Fed: Well, no, no, no, I don't,
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:21.240]  Fed: I think the noise might be one of these problems. [???]
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:22.960]  Val: So the things Intel fucked up,
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.120]  Val: and from the very beginning when we started making chips,
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120]  Val: there was a cache, or a cache, or whether you can,
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.800]  Val: yes, we could get all the credentials back
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:36.120]  Val: from the actual chip, and every single computer
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:39.240]  Val: in the world is vulnerable to this, every single computer,
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:41.000]  Val: and that's fucking amazing, right?
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.080]  Val: So that gives you completely new access,
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.840]  Val: and three different companies found this out at the same time.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.640]  Val: It's like the 100th monkey hearing.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.440]  Val: Do you know the thing?
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.280]  Val: The 100th monkey?
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.120]  Fed: Yeah, the 100th monkey.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.520]  Val: Great, yeah, it's just, the idea has sort of happened.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.760]  Val: But anyway, yeah, that's a whole new way of doing it.
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:57.760]  Val: I know how to do,
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.160]  Val: my best thing is social engineering,
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.560]  Val: and then, you know, I'm not really a coder.
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:06.400]  Val: I don't know how to do it,
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.160]  Val: but I can take other people's programs
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:11.680]  Val: and use them very well, you know?
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:14.200]  Val: Elcomsoft kind of pisses me off a little bit.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.520]  Val: These guys, they overdo it, but,
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.440]  Val: I mean, I have magnet, [sic] I have Elcomsoft,
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.000]  Val: I have the orange one.
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.520]  Val: I can't remember, I can't remember what it's called.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.440]  Val: Belkasoft, there's no issue, you know what?
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:30.280]  Val: Oh, you know what?
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:33.160]  Val: I'll show you, I'll show you what I got.
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:35.120]  Val: You know, magnet is the best right now.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:37.440]  Val: See, and I'm thinking, like, why go through,
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:40.800]  Val: why do all this extra work you don't need to do
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.040]  Val: if you can just get the fucking,
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.240]  Val: someone's already built the program,
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:46.200]  Val: why go out there and invent the wheel, right?
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:51.200]  Val: So if, for example, if Elcomsoft, oh shit,
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:53.360]  Val: let me see the options,
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:58.600]  Val: if Elcomsoft is already created a way
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:02.040]  Val: to get the tar ball off your iPhone 11,
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:04.120]  Val: why do I have to create a program
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:04.960]  Val: that do the same thing,
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.920]  Val: that you've got people that spend a lot of time
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.080]  Val: and money doing it?
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.280]  Val: So I'll just use their shit
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:11.240]  Val: and improvise with other people's shit.
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.640]  Val: Like, the pineapple is not that great, you know?
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.640]  Val: It's not that interesting.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.520]  Val: And also it's a little, it's not user-friendly, you know?
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.520]  Val: It's like you have to really sit down and study
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:25.120]  Val: the fucking stupid pineapple and what not to do it.
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.160]  Val: So I build a, like a fast way to do it for my girlfriend
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:29.120]  Val: because she wanted to know how to do it,
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.520]  Val: but she had no patience to sit down
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:35.520]  Val: and learn how to keep the AP or the evil twin thing. [sic]
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:38.520]  Val: You know, so I just showed her like a,
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.600]  Val: I created like a shortcut for her, which is sort of-
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.840]  Fed: How did you make it easier for her?
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.000]  Val: I automated it, yeah.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.400]  Val: It's easier if you do that,
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:52.720]  Val: because she just does one thing,
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:55.120]  Val: everything falls into place instead of making her,
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:58.240]  Val: it makes her think like she's accomplished something, you know?
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.120]  Val: It's not that hard to just automate, let me see, you know.
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:05.560]  Val: Sorry, so let me show you, for example.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.360]  Val: Oh, Evan Tree [???] was the other one.
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.920]  Fed: The other one is her Wi-Fi off, it's Bluetooth off.
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:11.760]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:13.560]  Val: Of course, of course.
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.600]  Val: Your security and ours, but-
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.240]  Val: Oh, really?
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:19.280]  Val: You guys got people, interesting.
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.600]  Val: Yeah, I mean, I think, sorry, I got all excited,
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.000]  Val: but I forgot that you guys were with the FBI.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  Val: Shit, okay, yeah, Wi-Fi's off, Bluetooth is off.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.120]  Val: So let's pull up, like phone breaker,
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.720]  Val: Xcode, I can do, I don't know,
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:43.840]  Val: can you be more specific, is there something you're looking for?
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.360]  Fed: Trying to assess your level of skill
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.080]  Fed: would like need your help to do something.
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:47.920]  Val: Okay.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.080]  Fed: You know, we needed you to look at, you know,
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.520]  Fed: vulnerable website or something like that,
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.040]  Fed: is that something you could do?
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:54.880]  Val: Oh.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:57.080]  Fed: You know, if we had a phone, we'd be pretty good.
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.640]  Val: The phone I could do a lot better
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.960]  Val: than I could with the vulnerable website.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:03.320]  Val: I could do the website, but it would take me a little extra time,
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.680]  Val: because I have not studied that one as much.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.840]  Val: I mean, I used to do it before,
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:10.720]  Val: maybe when it was easy, when everything was on the server,
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.800]  Val: and you could just do it through the back space.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:15.400]  Val: Remember, you could just do that stupid thing,
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.440]  Val: you know, maybe I could do that.
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.240]  Val: But the phone is more fun for me, that's easy,
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.040]  Val: that's not easy, but it's more of a challenge.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.840]  Val: Because I did my dad's phone, I did my girlfriend's phone,
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.920]  Val: and then people would find phones on the street for me
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:29.400]  Val: and just sell it to me, it's just like a phone practice.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.720]  Val: It is fun, that's what I like.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.360]  Val: And the remote stuff is,
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.160]  Val: well, am I gonna get in trouble
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:40.240]  Val: for telling you guys any of this shit?
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.920]  Fed: You told me like you murdered someone,
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.800]  Val: I never murdered anybody, okay?
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.520]  Val: No murder, okay?
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.120]  Val: The New York Times asked me to hack Epstein.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.160]  Val: Okay, so David wanted me to hack Epstein.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.200]  Val: So I did it, and everyone's very,
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.120]  Val: I didn't, oh sorry, I didn't do it.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.280]  Val: I started the process of doing it,
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.400]  Val: and I gave him the list of passwords,
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.440]  Val: and I gave him the list,
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.200]  Val: and I have this on email to prove to you,
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.680]  Val: okay, the passwords, and I gave him the list of logins,
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:13.440]  Val: that's it, all the credentials.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.360]  Val: And I gave him the Ghislane's credentials as well.
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:19.840]  Val: I did not break in, I did try, okay, made an attempt,
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.320]  Val: but it was a double authentication,
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.440]  Val: someone already got to it.
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:26.660]  Val: I don't know whose number it is,
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:28.920]  Val: but I have a phone number if you wanna trace it,
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.480]  Val: it would be helpful for you guys.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.640]  Val: And I found out a lot, for Kevin Hall,
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.720]  Val: actually, I did this one in the morning.
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:40.800]  Val: I know someone who's running around, so.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.640]  Oh, Kevin Hall is doing this one in the morning,
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.600]  Val: and he's a partner with me,
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.360]  Val: he wrote the Epstein story.
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.640]  Val: Yeah, he's really good, really good, yeah.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:59.880]  Val: [unintelligible] money laundering
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.520]  Val: so I helped him by just looking at his old email addresses
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.440]  Val: from like 1999, old banks that he used in old,
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:13.520]  Val: just old accounts, and lawyers that he used as well,
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:16.120]  Val: because a lot of the lawyers are hiding some money too.
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:18.760]  Val: Stuff like that, yeah.
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:24.000]  Val: Just, you know, I usually don't give away a secret,
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.240]  Val: but I'll give you a secret,
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.360]  Val: and it'll make it seem so mundane and obvious to you,
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.320]  Val: you'll think like, why didn't I think of that?
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:31.280]  Val: It's the easiest possible way to start,
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:33.960]  Val: and mostly, people ask you to find a password,
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.240]  Val: this is the easiest thing to do.
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:38.960]  Val: You just get a database of the billion or so
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:40.600]  Val: already hacked files,
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:43.480]  Val: you find the old password that somebody used,
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:45.600]  Val: and you just sort of engineer from there,
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.760]  Val: it's not that hard, yeah.
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.280]  Val: A lot of people don't change their passwords,
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:52.160]  Val: and when they do, they make a variation.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.000]  Fed: That's all you have.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:53.840]  Val: Right.
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:57.720]  Fed: I assume you usually work alone, do you work with other people?
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:02.720]  Val: No, no, I don't understand how you work with,
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:07.200]  Val: I mean, teach me, there's a way to work with other people,
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.280]  Val: yeah, teach me, because usually, I don't know,
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:12.080]  Val: like usually it's one person doing all the work,
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.960]  Val: and the other person is watching, so, I don't know.
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.440]  Val: But yeah, I'd like to, I would love to try, I mean.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.080]  Fed: Yeah, like I said, right now I'm completely list of stuff
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:27.680]  Fed: that like, okay, we could use help on this,
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:29.320]  Fed: so it's maybe something that we could do.
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:31.360]  Fed: We could try to find a spot for you, still.
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.160]  Fed: I feel like it's that, I guess, on my head.
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.200]  Val: What I'm really good at doing is I could find
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:37.920]  Val: stolen money and money laundering.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:39.280]  Val: If someone needs to move money,
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:40.680]  Val: I can show you how to do that.
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:44.080]  Val: I know how to, I know people that can reverse engineer,
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.160]  Val: there's a word for it, Bitcoin wallets?
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.920]  Reverse [???], what do you call it?
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.840]  Fed: Well, how do they, how do they,
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:54.320]  Fed: do you mean, they're gonna track where the Bitcoin goes,
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.200]  Val: no, they can find, no, how, where it came from.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:00.840]  Val: They can do the whole scrub, they call it,
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:03.000]  Val: it's not scrub, it's called the,
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.240]  Fed: they're watching it now, like you're telling,
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:08.840]  Fed: because it's all public, so that you can see
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:09.720]  Fed: where it goes to and from,
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:11.400]  Fed: you mean after it's been tumbled or something?
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:12.720]  Val: After it's been, yes.
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:15.240]  Val: Not tumbled, after it's been put into any wallet.
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:18.640]  Val: They can trace it, like a reverse trace.
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:20.600]  Val: There's two people I know that can do it.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:22.600]  Fed:That part's not too difficult, I'll tell you.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:23.440]  Val: It's not, okay.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:24.920]  Val: Oh, you can?
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.400]  Val: Okay, I don't know anything about it.
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.880]  Fed: And it's just like the ledger is public,
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:30.040]  Fed: so you can see where the money comes and goes to.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.160]  Fed:It's just that this number means nothing.
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.320]  Val: Oh, no, but it's not that simple.
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.160]  Val: I mean, yeah, I know there's an open ledger,
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:42.600]  Val: but it's also, there's like a wallet
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.400]  Val: that has self-account as well,
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.480]  Val: so you have to find out where it, yeah.
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.800]  Val: It's like, they know how to do that.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.080]  Val: They can, they can,
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.160]  Val: I'm not sure what the wording is.
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.040]  Val: You see, that would be nice.
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:57.280]  Val: I would like to know what the terms are for these things.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:59.360]  Val: I know how to do it, I know what the action is,
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:02.320]  Val: but I don't know the term, the term, the terminology.
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:06.960]  Fed: Okay, so what other stuff do you have access to?
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:09.240]  Fed: I mean, because you have access to a lot of journalists, right?
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:10.600]  Fed: And here's the thing.
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:12.720]  Fed: I don't really want to deal with journalists
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.200]  Fed: because it's the [unintelligible] stuff that's there.
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.360]  Val: Journalists have a lot of data.
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:20.560]  Val: They're a very untapped source of data.
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:22.560]  Val: You know, if you know how to say the right thing,
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:25.080]  Val: you can get all, I got the guys in Russia,
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:27.520]  Val: there was a spy on trial,
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.800]  Val: he's a banker spy, and I got the guy
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.040]  Val: to send me the whole fucking transcripts,
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:33.040]  Val: court records, everything.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.360]  Fed: You mean the journalist was able
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.280]  Fed: to get the court records in 2017?
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.960]  Val: Yes, okay, yes, interesting.
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.760]  Val: Journalists have a lot of shit,
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.560]  Val: and they just sit on it and just goes,
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:45.000]  Val: once the story's done, they forget about it.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:45.920]  Val: They don't need it anymore.
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:50.080]  Val: So there's a huge fucking great source of information.
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:52.840]  Val: Nobody even bothers to get it.
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:54.760]  Val: But I know so many journalists now,
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:56.400]  Val: and they're sending me shit all the time.
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:58.800]  Val: People, I just have this guy named,
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.720]  Val: well, I'm not gonna tell you his name,
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.920]  Val: because that would be kind of weird.
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.160]  Val: It would be rude to do that, too.
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:05.880]  Val: But he just found me on Twitter and said,
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.880]  Val: I think that there's some shady shit
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.000]  Val: going on in the Bank of Ireland.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.360]  Val: Can you take a look at this one?
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.920]  Val: And I guess, I take a look at it,
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:17.920]  Val: and lo and behold, Wilbur Ross stole $35 billion
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.280]  Val: from Bank of Ireland.
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.960]  Val: Well, Wilbur Ross and his compatriots,
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.960]  Val: but 23, he calls them hedge funds because they're not hedge
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:31.160]  Val: funds, they're more like LSEs.
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.560]  Val: But 23 of them that he owns, Wilbur Ross owns, okay?
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.520]  Val: Bank of Ireland hid $35 billion in promissory bonds, sorry.
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.920]  Val: He bought a portion of that bank for 1% for like,
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.000]  Val: like something so touchy, like a couple billion dollars.
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.840]  Val: And his, that share gave him access to $35 billion,
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:57.720]  Val: which he pulled out, and it's fucking amazing.
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:58.680]  Val: It's amazing.
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.000]  Val: So look, I get shit like that,
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.440]  Val: but then I get the weird spy people, you know?
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.400]  Val: Like the crazy people, they're not crazy.
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.640]  Val: They're, sometimes they're reading a script.
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:09.440]  Val: Like, I don't know if they're intelligence
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:11.000]  Val: from corporate intelligence,
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.680]  Val: or if they're actual state-run intelligence.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.040]  Val: I can't tell.
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:16.000]  Val: Like this guy, Kaiser Soze, right?
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  Val: So he's, he did a very classic move where you,
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:25.680]  Val: instead of going right for me, he goes to people around me,
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.160]  Val: and then they start talking about,
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.960]  Val: and I'm like, oh, who's this guy you're talking about?
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:29.800]  Val: Right?
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:30.640]  Val: And that's how I get hooked.
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:32.840]  Val: And I saw that coming a mile away, right?
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:34.600]  Val: So I was like, okay, I'm here.
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:35.800]  Val: What do you want to say?
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.520]  Val: And he won't tell me what his real name.
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:40.920]  Val: And he goes into this story, it's very specific,
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.600]  Val: and it's very good, and I really wish it was true,
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:44.960]  Val: but I don't believe it is.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.480]  Val: But I do believe that 60 to 40% of it,
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:54.160]  Val: somewhere over this bridge of the 50% mark, is true.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.360]  Val: It makes sense.
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:57.720]  Val: Trump, there was a meeting in Deutsche Bank,
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:59.400]  Val: he says, when my father was there,
[02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:01.000]  Val: and he, it's a lie, my father was never there.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.600]  Val: I checked his schedule, he did not go to this meeting.
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:05.800]  Val: And Jurgen Fitchison was not there either.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:06.960]  Val: He claims he was there.
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:10.160]  Val: And two people from Natsutzky were there,
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:12.040]  Val: and he was one of them, right?
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.520]  Val: He says that they came in to buy a CLO,
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:18.600]  Val: which is a collateralized loan obligation.
[02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:20.920]  Val: It's basically a structured product.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:25.920]  Val: It's a, it's a whole shitload of mortgages
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.360]  Val: put together into one bundle that you can buy.
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:31.680]  Val: And it's like a bank-to-bank thing.
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:33.560]  Val: You can't, it probably gives no [???] access to it.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.520]  Val: So they thought they were gonna get rid of this,
[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:38.800]  Val: this charge, and sell it to Natsutzky.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:40.720]  Val: And the guy said, well, the problem is,
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:43.360]  Val: we don't want you to buy it, we just want you to look at it
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.040]  Val: and tell us what you think.
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.000]  Val: And tell us where you see the problem.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.560]  Val: So they looked at it and they saw that,
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.560]  Val: to make this long story short,
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:54.160]  Val: Donald Trump did not sign a consenting agreement.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:56.600]  Val: Okay, so if you have a,
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:59.800]  Val: if you guys are all in a trust, right,
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:02.040]  Val: that means that you're all shared,
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.440]  Val: it's sort of the money that's pooled together.
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:08.280]  Val: Let's say you wanted to borrow $5 million
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.280]  Val: to start a golf course, right?
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.040]  Val: But you don't tell these guys.
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.800]  Val: You take it, you take the $5 million,
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:14.640]  Val: you don't tell them,
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:16.640]  Val: and you don't sign a consenting agreement.
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:20.120]  Val: If you fail, they have to pay your debt, right?
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.880]  Val: If you sign a consenting agreement,
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.040]  Val: then they're free, right?
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:26.680]  Val: They're not liable for your debt if you fail.
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:27.520]  Val: But you made money,
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.120]  Val: you bring it back in and put it in the pool,
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.640]  Val: and everyone's very happy, except that you didn't,
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:35.120]  Val: they overlooked the fact that you didn't sign this agreement.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:37.760]  Val: Now, Trump didn't sign three of them, right?
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.400]  Val: Which means the people at Deutsche Bank
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:43.440]  Val: and the high net worth individuals at DBTCA specifically
[02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:46.080]  Val: will be very upset to know that,
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.360]  Val: and it would cause a run on DBTCA.
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:52.800]  Val: Now, and DBTCA has $23 billion going for it,
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:56.840]  Val: and they still don't have a fucking chief risk officer,
[02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.480]  Val: all right, $23 billion.
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:03.480]  Val: That is a 700 person entity, all right?
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:06.920]  Val: There's 25,000 Deutsche Bank America,
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.800]  Val: 700 people in DBTCA.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.520]  Val: It's very secretive, it's a weird place,
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.080]  Val: and that's where my dad,
[02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:15.120]  Val: that's where they put my father when he died,
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.320]  Val: when he killed himself.
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:19.480]  Val: There's a French guy that runs it,
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.040]  Val: and he was supposedly at this meeting as well.
[02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.360]  Val: Now, I'll just, fuck it, I'll just tell you.
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:31.360]  Val: The first guy is Rebolyev, signed off on the loan, okay?
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:35.280]  Val: The second one is, I don't believe him,
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.840]  Val: because I fed him the answer, and I fucked up.
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:40.280]  Val: You know when you say, oh, did you hear the word
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:41.760]  Val: Victor Bexelberg in the room?
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:43.520]  Val: He goes, oh yeah, that's it, right?
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.320]  Val: Fuck, I shouldn't have said that, yeah.
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:48.200]  Val: So he claims Victor Bexelberg was number two,
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.000]  Val: and number three is interesting,
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.040]  Val: I didn't believe him until yesterday,
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:55.280]  Val: because something interesting happened yesterday.
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:59.680]  Val: He said that SpareBank signed on behalf,
[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:01.440]  Val: a person signed on behalf of SpareBank,
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:03.440]  Val: not anyone you've heard of, but as,
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.760]  Val: sorry, I'm sorry, not SpareBank, Gazprom.
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:09.680]  Val: Gazprom is [??] an entity signed off on a loan.
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:11.000]  Val: I'm like, what the fuck, how can an entity
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:11.840]  Val: sign off on a loan?
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:13.120]  Val: I've never heard of that.
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:16.680]  Val: Until yesterday, when this Irish guy I was telling about
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:20.800]  Val: sends me a, they call it charges,
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:23.720]  Val: they call it in Ireland, they call them charges mortgages,
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:24.560]  Val: right?
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:28.200]  Val: He sends me this, I have it right here if you wanna see it,
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:34.040]  Val: this charge of some land that was sold in Ireland
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.280]  Val: by Deutsche Bank.
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.680]  Val: So Deutsche Bank, as a bank, is an entity liable for it.
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:40.280]  Val: I was like, holy shit, it does,
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:42.600]  Val: and that's very, I've never seen that before.
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:44.640]  Val: And he asked me, I've never seen this before,
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.040]  Val: and I have not answered him yet,
[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:48.120]  Val: I'm not gonna tell him yes, you know,
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:50.000]  Val: because I don't know who the fuck he's doing,
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.640]  Val: where his game is.
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:54.840]  Val: He's telling me that he wants to find a proper journalist,
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:56.640]  Val: he wants Ronan Farrow, so I'm like, okay fine,
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.880]  Val: here's Ronan Farrow, give him a Ronan Farrow,
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:01.680]  Val: but he's still sending me documents, so I don't know.
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:07.840]  Val: And it's, things like that happen a lot, so, yeah.
[02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:09.000]  Fed: So what do you wanna, like, you know,
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.760]  Fed: economic fraud type stuff, it's good information.
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:14.880]  Fed: If that's the case too, we'll probably pass it to
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:17.320]  Fed: an economic fraud agent, if you can help out too.
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:19.080]  Val: Sure.
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:21.800]  Fed: What other, like, are you involved in any hacking groups?
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:25.160]  Fed: Do you know of any hacking groups that you can get into?
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:26.400]  Fed: Like, yeah, a dark net type thing.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:31.400]  Val: Well, I mean, is this like, what if I say yes, am I in trouble?
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.840]  Val: Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's one group.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:37.440]  Fed: Because obviously the FBI monitors a lot of these things,
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:38.840]  Fed: and you like to see, you know, what's going on.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:40.880]  Val: Yeah, you guys are in that signal group, aren't you?
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.120]  Fed: What signal group?
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:43.760]  Val: Which one?
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:45.680]  Val: There's a bunch of signal groups.
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:48.640]  Val: There's one, I know there's some people that we checked,
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:50.320]  Val: and there's some like, brand new,
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:53.360]  Val: limited identities for some people,
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.040]  Val: we don't know where they came from, so.
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:57.280]  Val: I thought it was either FBI, or it was like,
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:59.480]  Val: some spies or something, so I don't know.
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:02.320]  Fed: In the signal group, so the signal group,
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.520]  Fed: there's a bunch of new identities?
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:05.920]  Val: Well, it's not, there's a couple of,
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.680]  Val: more than one signal group, so there's a group of people,
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:10.040]  Val: and they're not all hackers, it's like,
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.000]  Val: it's a mix of very interesting people.
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.600]  Val: Yeah, yeah, it's like, some of the greatest journalists,
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:17.720]  Val: and some of the greatest hackers,
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:19.280]  Val: and some of the greatest activists,
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.160]  Val: some of the greatest writers, you know,
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:24.360]  Val: and some just fucking fine, interesting people.
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.800]  Val: You know, everyone's having a conversation,
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.400]  Val: but specifically a hacking group, no.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.160]  Val: But there's like, different variations of these signal groups,
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:33.800]  Val: and this one is Barrett, so.
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:34.920]  Val: When he said Houston, I was like,
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:36.800]  Val: oh fuck, he's after Barrett Brown.
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:40.040]  Fed: Barrett's on the radar, I mean.
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:40.880]  Val: Yeah?
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:42.440]  Fed: Like, but you know that, I mean,
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.440]  Fed: he's been arrested already.
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:48.200]  Val: I know, he's in rehab right now, yeah, okay, good so, yeah.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:50.080]  Fed: Well, what's Barrett up to, do you talk to him?
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:51.320]  Val: Yeah, I talk to him all the time,
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:53.600]  Val: he pisses me off, he's a little fucking shit,
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.800]  Val: because he's supposed to write great,
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.800]  Val: huge, thunderous story against Val versus David Enrich,
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.240]  Val: but he got too high, and just fucking forgot about it.
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:06.680]  Val: Well, not forgot about it, just didn't do it.
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:09.000]  Val: So, and he hasn't even apologized yet,
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.400]  Val: so I'm very pissed off.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  Val: And I've got reams and reams of texts with him, so, yeah.
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:19.440]  Val: And he's a good guy, but he doesn't know shit about computers.
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:20.920]  Val: He's not an hacker.
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:22.800]  Fed: He was part of a Anonymous for a good bit.
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:24.840]  Val: Yeah, but he's a talker, he's not an hacker.
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:27.520]  Val: No, you barely know how to do that.
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:30.080]  Val: He couldn't find his key chain.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.040]  Val: Seriously, he doesn't know shit.
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:34.360]  Val: That's the funny part about Barrett,
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:36.680]  Val: he doesn't know anything about computers.
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:37.520]  Val: Yeah.
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:38.520]  Fed: So, does Barrett [unintelligible]
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:42.840]  Val: No, no, no, he's, you know, just,
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:45.160]  Val: he's kind of like, the reason I have some respect for him
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:47.800]  Val: is because he's sort of, like, on this vengeful path
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:48.960]  Val: that I understand now.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.440]  Val: I've never been on a vengeful path before,
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:54.000]  Val: but now I understand it, I've started it,
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.400]  Val: and I know that's what he's doing too.
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.480]  Val: Like, whatever happened with the FBI and him.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:00.520]  Val: But I don't know, I just think it's hilarious
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.360]  Val: when he got raided and he was live on the webcam.
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:04.840]  Val: I just thought that was funny, I don't know.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.640]  Val: But then he fucking, I told him,
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:10.040]  Val: I actually recorded this conversation,
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:12.640]  Val: I told him, like, look, dude, where you fucked up
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:15.520]  Val: is where you went after the FBI agent's family.
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:16.760]  Val: That was stupid.
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:18.880]  Val: You must understand how dumb that was.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.840]  Val: "Yes, but, you know, I was already
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:22.080]  Val: "gonna be put in jail anyway,"
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:25.280]  Val: so, come on, bro, you could have avoided a lot of shit
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:27.400]  Val: if you just didn't do that stupid shit.
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:30.120]  Val: So he has an ego that won't,
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.240]  Val: that's his biggest issue, his ego.
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:36.240]  Val: He can't drop it for a second.
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.240]  Val: He doesn't have the humility or the ability to try.
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:44.320]  Val: That's the problem.
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.880]  Val: That's why you can't trust someone like that in here.
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:49.000]  Fed: Do you guys talk over Signal?
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.560]  Val: Yeah, yeah.
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.560]  Val: Well, again, I was trying to help him.
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.160]  Val: He had no where, he's like homeless now,
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:57.160]  Val: with his weird girlfriend, so I was trying to help him.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.280]  Val: You know, I got him a couple of hotel rooms,
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.120]  Val: I sent him some money, he was like, you know,
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:05.480]  Val: and then my girlfriend goes out of her way to,
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:07.760]  Val: sorry, now I'm just complaining, but she goes,
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:09.600]  Val: out of her way to get him a place to live
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  Val: for like a month, so he's off the streets,
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.640]  Val: he doesn't have to worry about food and shit,
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:15.840]  Val: he can just work, because she's like,
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:18.280]  Val: do the thing where he fucking promised he promised us,
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:19.880]  Val: like, here's a place to live.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.040]  Val: And instead of just going there and saying thank you
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.400]  Val: and doing it, he just like,
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.720]  Val: creates this whole chaotic thing of like,
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.360]  Val: well, you didn't tell me to call this day,
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:31.200]  Val: and you know, like this minutiae,
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:32.720]  Val: so he sabotages the whole thing,
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:33.640]  Val: and then at the end I'm like
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.560]  Val: you know what, Barrett, go fuck yourself.
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.480]  Val: I don't, it's not opening anymore,
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.040]  Val: the windows closed, it's done.
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:42.400]  Val: And he's like, fuck you, I'm Barrett, you know.
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.120]  Val: No, and I ignore him, the more I ignore him,
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.080]  Val: the more he wants your attention.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:47.320]  Fed: Where is he now,
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.400]  Fed: I mean, where in rehab, is it in Dallas [???] or?
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:54.240]  Val: Do you really want to know?
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:55.760]  Fed: I was just curious, I mean, like.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.720]  Val: You're like, what?
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:28:59.000]  Fed: No, maybe, you don't want to tell,
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:28:59.840]  Fed: you don't have to tell.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:02.560]  Val: No, I, I, I think it's important,
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:05.600]  Val: I think I want to know what and why.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.400]  Val: Like, if I'm going to take the accountability
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:08.680]  Val: of doing something to somebody here,
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:10.560]  Val: I'm going to get someone in trouble or put in jail,
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.880]  Val: I would like to know who it is,
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:13.880]  Val: why I'm doing it and what for it.
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:14.720]  Val: You know what I mean?
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:16.440]  Fed: I get it, I mean, I'll tell you this right now,
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:19.560]  Fed: I can't tell you everything we do, right?
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.960]  Fed: Like I said, I'll be honest with you
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:22.520]  Fed: as much as you're going to be honest with me.
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.240]  Fed: I can't tell you the motivation behind
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:26.120]  Fed: every single question I ask,
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.160]  Fed: because there's a lot of things that the FBI does,
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:31.400]  Fed: like if we had an investigation into whatever,
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:34.480]  I don't know, call it Barrett Brown, for example.
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:36.320]  Fed: And you wanted to know why, and it's because,
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.440]  Fed: oh, we're going to arrest him tomorrow, right?
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:40.720]  Fed: And then you don't say, hey, Barrett, by the way,
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.280]  Fed:  the FBI's going to fuck you tomorrow.
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:43.120]  Val: Yeah.
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:44.960]  Fed: It probably wouldn't go well for us, right?
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.240]  Val: So that would have to be my choice, right?
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:48.080]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:51.280]  Fed: So everything you could tell is totally up to you, right?
[02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.120]  Fed: Like I'm not forcing you to give anything,
[02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:53.960]  Fed: you're here on your own.
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:56.200]  Val: Well, I'm not going to give you a Barrett Brown right now.
[02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:57.920]  Val: If there's something that he's done
[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:00.520]  Val: that you feel you want to know,
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:02.280]  Val: or if this is a vendetta thing,
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:04.680]  Val: then I don't want to be part of the vendetta.
[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:05.520]  Fed: Don't worry about that.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.680]  Fed: I mean, I'm trying to assess what information you have,
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:10.360]  Fed: because whenever he's up there, I'm in Houston, so like.
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.400]  Val: Sure, you know, I've got a Jeremy Hammond,
[02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:15.480]  Val: Gregg Housh, all the guys, all these people.
[02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:17.200]  Fed: Because like that's the other thing we have to assess too,
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:18.520]  Fed: is if you're not willing to help.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.080]  Val: But Gregg worked with you, Gregg worked with you already.
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:23.200]  Val: Gregg worked with you guys.
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:25.240]  Val: He's already been helpful, you know.
[02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:26.080]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:27.760]  Fed: Like that's the thing is we're collecting
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:29.760]  Fed: a lot of information on a lot of different things, right?
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:30.600]  Val: Right.
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:33.280]  Fed: So part of it is, it's going to be a one-way street
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:34.280]  Fed: of information this way.
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:36.400]  Fed: I can't give you all the information that's,
[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.840]  Fed: so like if that's what you expect, then, you know,
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.000]  Fed: it's no hard feelings, and we part ways, and it's just fun.
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.840]  Fed: Because I can't tell you everything we do, because.
[02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:45.680]  Val: I know, I don't.
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:47.320]  Fed: You don't know me, I don't know you either.
[02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:49.160]  Val: I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:50.240]  Val: I don't.
[02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:53.480]  Val: No expectations, I just, if it's something that is,
[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:59.800]  Val: if I mean, I'm going to be accountable for someone's life,
[02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:02.840]  Val: I'd really like to think it through, you know.
[02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:03.680]  Val: Yeah.
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:06.480]  Val: I mean, if you want me to blindly follow orders.
[02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:08.560]  Val: I mean, I will right now,
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:11.040]  Val: because Marlowe's life is in jeopardy, of course.
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.600]  Val: I'll do whatever the fuck you want to save Marlowe,
[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:16.080]  Val: but at a certain, after that, you know,
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:18.240]  Val: I will have to draw a line or something.
[02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:19.440]  Fed: And I, so here's the thing,
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:21.640]  Fed: I want you to be as conscious of the decision.
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:23.200]  Fed: Let's take Marlow's whole way out of the situation.
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:24.040]  Val: Okay.
[02:31:24.040 --> 02:31:26.840]  Fed: And you resolve Marlowe, everything's both copacetic.
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:28.800]  Fed: I want you to make the same decision as her then,
[02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:29.680]  Fed: as you would before that.
[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:31.400]  Val: Okay, well then, that depends on you.
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:33.880]  Val: If I like you guys, and I believe that this is,
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:36.840]  Val: you are like Tim and Jammy, and like you, again,
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.800]  Val: if they told, sent you to me, then I'm trusting them.
[02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:42.760]  Val: I believe you guys are the good people,
[02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:45.280]  Val: because there are some bad people in the FBI.
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.160]  Val: All right, there's some really fucking shits.
[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.760]  Val: In every, not just the FBI, but everywhere.
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:51.680]  Val: And it's hard to find them and negotiate.
[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:53.560]  Val: And you know, my read on you right now
[02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:56.240]  Val: is that you're a very highly intelligent guy.
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.680]  Val: You know, but you're hiding something from me right now,
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.520]  Val: and you haven't still,
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:01.560]  Val: you still haven't told me you're hiding something right now.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.720]  Val: And you are here to suss me out
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:04.240]  Val: from a totally different point of view.
[02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:06.320]  Val: I'm not sure what point of view that is.
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:08.600]  Val: And you are here to completely give
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:10.240]  Val: the female point of view.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:11.440]  Fed: Oh, wow.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:13.840]  Val: I'm joking.
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:17.760]  Val: You have a whole other case that you need help on,
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.320]  Val: which is not even related to this,
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:21.400]  Val: but I'm trying to figure out what that is for.
[02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:23.840]  Val: But you seem more like a New York-style person,
[02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:25.240]  Val: not an LA person.
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:27.120]  Val: So I'm thinking you've got to be,
[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:29.480]  Val: you've got to be closer than Tim,
[02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:32.040]  Val: and you've got to be with Desky and Lyne.
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:35.480]  Val: No, not with Desky and Lyne.
[02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:39.920]  Val: Anyway, so, but your thing's unrelated to their thing,
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:40.760]  Val: right?
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:42.440]  Val: Am I close?
[02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:44.400]  Val: Okay.
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:45.560]  Fed: [unintelligible]
[02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.520]  Val: That's okay, but that's what you tell me,
[02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:49.360]  Val: and then I,
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:50.200]  Fed: So, it's a matter of thinking.
[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:51.280]  Fed: I'm trying to assess you.
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:52.960]  Fed: The thing is,
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.080]  Fed: We're being straight up.
[02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:55.920]  Fed: Yep.
[02:32:55.920 --> 02:32:59.040]  Fed: I mean, I think [unintelligible]
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:00.520]  Fed: you know, they're wrong,
[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:04.720]  Fed: and we do this job for the right reasons.
[02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:06.200]  Fed: There are bad apples out there,
[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:09.160]  Fed: and that's not what you've got across.
[02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:10.040]  Val: That's right.
[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:15.440]  Fed: I think the fact that when we listen to you,
[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:17.920]  Fed: and we ask you questions about Marlowe,
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:22.280]  Fed: That's not even worse than having a family to report.
[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:24.040]  Fed: And you've been through that.
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:25.560]  Fed: You know, you have a history.
[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:26.400]  Val: I have,
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:28.440]  Val: but I have to also question you and think,
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.440]  Val: well, you know, I mean, I could be any way,
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:31.560]  Val: what if I'm the bad guy,
[02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:32.760]  Val: and I'm sitting here talking to you.
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:34.760]  Val: So do you have to figure out,
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.600]  Val: where am I,
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:37.440]  Val: am I the good person or the bad person, right?
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:38.640]  Val: I told you my side of the story.
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:40.520]  Val: Of course, I'm gonna make myself look good.
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:42.600]  Val: You guys have to do your background on me.
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:44.120]  Val: So I figured, have you already done it?
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:45.280]  Val: If I would not be sitting here,
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:46.120]  Val: if you hadn't done it,
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.040]  Val: I'd already figured out I was the good guy.
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:49.800]  Val: So I'm gonna have to trust you on that.
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:50.720]  Val: That's what I,
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:53.760]  Val: now I could be jumping to conclusions here,
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:55.720]  Val: but that's why I figured it is happening, right?
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:57.000]  Fed: So you're right on that part,
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.560]  Fed: because I wouldn't bring you in here
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:01.040]  Fed: in a situation like this,
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:02.640]  Fed: if you were my target, right?
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:04.560]  Fed: If you were my target, we would arrest of you.
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.400]  Val: Right, right.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.320]  Fed: That being said,
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:09.520]  Fed: we're still trying to figure each other out, right?
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:10.360]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:11.680]  Fed: We need to figure out what our role is,
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:12.920]  Fed: and we're trying to figure out
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:15.000]  Fed: if you've got any information that can help us.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.400]  Val: So, what, oh, databases?
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.640]  Val: Yes, I do have OCCP, [sic]
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:23.080]  Val: and I did have all of Emma's stuff too,
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.560]  Val: Hunter, actually it's still available,
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.960]  Val: Hunter Archives.
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.800]  Fed: Okay.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:30.720]  Val: And the ICIJ,
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:31.560]  Val: and I've got,
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:34.720]  Fed: I don't know, so access to OCCP and,
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:36.200]  Fed: what's Hunter?
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.440]  Val: If I could show up for a second,
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:39.560]  Val: I'd have admin access to you.
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:40.400]  Val: This is really good.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:41.740]  Val: I got all the shit that I,
[02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:46.740]  Val: it was OCCP, yeah, thank you.
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:51.280]  Val: If you want my files,
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.080]  Val: then hook me up with your admin access.
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.280]  Val: I want to see all this shit, you know?
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:57.120]  Val: I can't be stuck looking at half the document.
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.480]  Val: If you want me to find the fucking money launderers,
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:01.480]  Val: you need to see the whole breadth of the thing.
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:03.360]  Val: I have to follow the whole paper trail.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.160]  Val: So, that's it.
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.800]  Fed: So, what do they have on OCCP?
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:07.640]  Fed: I've heard about it.
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.480]  Val: So much shit, so much shit.
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:10.400]  Val: Dude, it's great.
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:12.240]  Val: It's great, everything, everything.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.080]  Val: Every, I mean, Panama Papers, you know, everything.
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:18.840]  Val: All my shit is there, you know?
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:20.640]  Val: All of Emma's stuff is there.
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:25.000]  Val: So, Hunter Archives would be the DDoS Secrets and Emma's stuff.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.720]  Val: And then that server got.
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:29.280]  Val: raided in Germany and one in America or something.
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:30.120]  Val: Which is a shame,
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:31.720]  Val: because it was like a public service that archive.
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:33.240]  Val: It was really good.
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:38.320]  Val: But it's like a, that was her big coup de grace out there,
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:41.200]  Val: her big tiara on her head sort of thing.
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.760]  Val: What's the word I'm talking about here?
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:44.600]  Fed: Her baby or what?
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:45.760]  Val: Yeah, whatever it is.
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:49.880]  Val: But it's also, that's like one 20th of the OCCP.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.160]  Val: Who's Emma Best and why is she important?
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:56.160]  Val: You know, I don't think she's important.
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:57.440]  Val: Actually, I think she's full of shit.
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.360]  Val: She says, oh, I used to work for the CIA,
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:01.000]  Val: but I can't tell you.
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:03.440]  Val: Like one of those old, you know, isn't that community?
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:05.280]  Fed: Is Emma Best her real name or?
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.200]  Val: I don't know, okay.
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.280]  Val: All I know is that I think she is a,
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.320]  Val: I'm still trying to figure out,
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:16.280]  Val: not, you know, in any pejorative manner.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:19.480]  Val: But I think she was a man first,
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:21.320]  Val: and then became a woman, or was she a woman who became a,
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:22.280]  Val: I don't even know that.
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.920]  Val: I just know it's some sort of gender change.
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.480]  Val: And I know that her boyfriend or girlfriend,
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.960]  Val: I don't know if she was also a man first,
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:33.680]  Val: but I do know that he slash she is kind of an asshole,
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:34.640]  Val: and that's it.
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:39.640]  Val: It's like the kind of person that asked for money,
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.480]  Val: and then, like, we need money,
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:44.360]  Val: we need help because we have an autistic child.
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.360]  Val: And how do you say no to that?
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:48.760]  Val: You know, but then they sort of say,
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:52.960]  Val: go fuck yourself if you have an idea that they don't have.
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:53.960]  Val: Like in this one group,
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.960]  Val: but a friend of mine was just trying to actually Barrett.
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:00.960]  Val: was like, yeah, you know,
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.560]  Val: whatever you do, don't attack this person at this turn,
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:05.400]  Val: that this,
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:11.120]  Val: sort of a lawyer that I can't think of.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:13.640]  Val: I'm losing my speed here,
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.000]  Val: but a nonprofit, some sort of nonprofit,
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.200]  Val: don't attack the specific lawyer because he's a good guy.
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:20.840]  Val: And then she says, fuck you, he's a terrible guy.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:22.480]  Val: I can attack whoever the fuck I want.
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:27.080]  Val: And this is Emma's partner, spouse.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:30.520]  Fed: You know, they're, name is or anything?
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.800]  Val: Xan, is there a fake name, X-A-N?
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:34.640]  Val: No, X-A-N.
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:37.840]  Val: Yeah, but I think she's, like,
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:41.120]  Val: it was a whole, it's a dramatically stupid,
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:43.680]  Val: but it's like, but there was this whole drama yesterday
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:48.680]  Val: about she's working in a diner and she got sad
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:51.760]  Val: and she started crying, she couldn't contain her feelings,
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.120]  Val: and it was all melodramatic, and like, so what?
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:55.960]  Val: What are you trying to say?
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.880]  Val: If you want money, just say, can I have money?
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.400]  Val: Because we will respect you more
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:01.040]  Val: if you just come out and ask for it.
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.840]  Val: Instead of telling us how sad you are,
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.240]  Val: that you have to work in a diner, right?
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:06.600]  Val: It's like, fuck you for saying that,
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:08.960]  Val: and that's the sort of, no, I don't mean it, right?
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:09.800]  Fed: [unintelligible]
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:13.080]  Val: Yeah, yeah, you know, it's like, it's enough.
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:14.320]  Fed: You want money?
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.800]  Val: Yeah, you know, and, yeah, so.
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:21.160]  Fed: So is Xan saying a hacker or is he just doing one of these
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:25.160]  Val: yeah to be honest with you, okay.
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:30.160]  Val: I, so I felt like I hacked Deutsche Bank,
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.640]  Val: although I didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:34.120]  Val: I felt like I did a pretty good job of hacking it,
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:36.440]  Val: not directly, I didn't go into their servers and do it,
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:38.880]  Val: but I fucking hacked that bank.
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:42.160]  Val: And it, well, not maybe in the sense of a hacker,
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:43.480]  Val: you probably, if you're a proper hacker,
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.320]  Val: you would not see it.
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:46.000]  Val: But in social engineering and all the people,
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.440]  Val: when McKaylee Faisola went to jail,
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.640]  Val: I put the fucking bail, [???] too, all right?
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:52.600]  Val: I got all the data, exposed everything,
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:53.840]  Val: and there's still more to come,
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.360]  Val: which you don't know about, all right?
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.920]  Val: There's a lot more to come, yes.
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.160]  Val: So I, so when Emma's guy, I forgot his name,
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.160]  Val: the LulzSec, the Spanish guy, hacked the Cayman Islands,
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:08.240]  Val: right?
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:10.040]  Val: That was a great one, by the way, it's good stuff.
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.200]  Fed: What happened with Cayman?
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:13.520]  Fed: I just don't know about it.
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.800]  Val: Well, for me, it was on this, you don't know about it?
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:16.640]  Fed: It was here, right?
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:17.960]  Val: Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:18.960]  Fed: I missed it, I'm sorry.
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:19.800]  Val: Oh, it's great.
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.640]  Fed: That's definitely hacking news.
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:23.880]  Val: No, I guess this guy was on the service for like a year,
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:26.200]  Val: and it was just, I think he took all the Bitcoin,
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:27.480]  Val: like all of it.
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:29.880]  Val: And so he said, hey, anybody out there hack a bank,
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:32.400]  Val: I'm gonna give you $100,000 of Bitcoin.
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:33.240]  Val: So I'm like, you know what?
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:34.440]  Val: Hey, Emma, could you tell your friend,
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:36.480]  Val: I think I deserve at least a run-in
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:38.320]  Val: for this $100,000 in Bitcoin,
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:40.080]  Val: because although I did not hack Deutsche Bank,
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.040]  Val: that's why I'm trying to work.
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.480]  Fed: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:43.840]  Val: And so Emma's like, no, you didn't,
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:44.920]  Val: you didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:47.720]  Val: but she didn't say, oh, let me pass on the message.
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:49.400]  Val: She didn't say, oh, hold on a second,
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:53.000]  Val: she just immediately responded as if she was the hacker.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.760]  Val: So I suspected that it's possible that she's the hacker.
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:58.800]  Val: I've always thought she was,
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:39:59.960]  Val: because I always ask her.
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:02.600]  Val: Like I'm incriminating myself,
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:04.320]  Val: but I'm constantly asking like, Emma,
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:05.560]  Val: can you figure out how to do this?
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:06.600]  Val: Can you hack this shit for me?
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:08.320]  Val: Because I can't get past this point, you know?
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:11.320]  Val: Like with the, for example, David Enrich,
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.640]  Val: we have so much more, oh, this would be something
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:19.560]  Val: maybe you could help me with.
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:22.120]  Val: So many efforts and incriminates him
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.520]  Val: with so many fucking terrible things that he's done
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:25.920]  Val:  and all the shit he's done for me.
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:27.560]  Val: It was all in signal.
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:30.120]  Val: And I took my phone to get the screen fix at the Apple Store
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:32.920]  Val: and I said, whatever you do, do not reset the phone.
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:35.680]  Val: And the fucking, the fucker has reset the phone.
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:36.760]  Val: And so I lost it all.
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:38.440]  Val: But I think it's an iPhone 6S,
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:40.240]  Val: so it's not irretrievable.
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.400]  Val: It's still on the fucking phone.
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.320]  Val: But I cannot get the keys.
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:45.600]  Val: I don't know how to get the fucking keys yet.
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:48.400]  Val: It's been the slowest thing I've ever learned.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.960]  Val: But I've got the tar ball, I've extracted the messages,
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:52.560]  Val: but I cannot get the fucking encryption keys
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.320]  Val: because I can't find them on the phone.
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:55.480]  Val: That's where I'm stuck.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:58.840]  Val: It's like, that was, well, Elcomsoft.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:01.960]  Val: iOS, Forensic edition.
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:06.960]  Val: iOS, Forensic, it's just toolkits.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:11.200]  Val: iOS, Forensic, toolkits, it's a quick thing to do.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.520]  Fed: I mean, at least from my experience,
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:17.320]  Fed: Elcomsoft isn't like a great [???] with forensic utility.
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:20.440]  Fed: Like, I've played around with it, but I didn't use it because,
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:22.320]  Fed: like, they don't automatically decrypt stuff
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:25.400]  Fed: because, like, most normal forensics programs do.
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:26.240]  Val: Really?
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:27.560]  Val: All right.
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:29.720]  Fed: I'll talk to you about the free one.
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:30.560]  Fed: Autopsy?
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:31.400]  Val: Is it good?
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:32.240]  Fed: Autopsy's [???] not bad.
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:34.320]  Fed: I mean, that's a free one that anyone can download, isn't it?
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:35.560]  Fed: It's a bunch of other ones that, I think,
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.360]  Fed: a better job than Elcomsoft.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:38.360]  Val: Yeah.
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:40.400]  Val: I just, well, it's because I spent the money.
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:41.720]  Val: You know, it's having expenses,
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:43.440]  Val: so I feel like I have to learn it.
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:44.280]  Val: Yeah.
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:48.960]  Fed: I don't know.
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.920]  Fed: Another company that kind of delved into mobile,
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:51.760]  Fed: it does just my opinion.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:53.080]  Val: No, no, no, you're right.
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.280]  Val: They're really famous because of the thing with the photographs
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:58.480]  Val: in 2015, right?
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:00.440]  Fed: So, like, they're kind of, riding their coattails,
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:02.280]  Fed: now they have a mobile forensic thing that they're like,
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:03.760]  Fed: well, if we put this out and they trust our name,
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:04.600]  Fed: then they'll use it.
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:05.800]  Fed: But, just from my experience,
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:07.200]  Fed: I just haven't had much success with it.
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.560]  Val: Did you try Axiom?
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:09.400]  Fed: I used Axiom.
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:10.240]  Val: What do you think of that one?
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.080]  Fed: That's not bad.
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:12.000]  Fed: It's a lot of good functionality.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.520]  Val: Yeah, it's pretty strong.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.360]  Val: Yeah.
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:15.520]  Val: It's very good.
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:17.640]  Val: So then I figured out you can just get pre-trials,
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:21.840]  Val: if you just say you're extending the pre-trials.
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:24.680]  Val: But yeah.
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:29.680]  Fed: So you think that Best is, she actually is a NSA, CIA?
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.560]  Val: No, I think she's full of shit, yeah.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:36.040]  Fed: But do you think that she's a hacker?
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:36.880]  Val: I do.
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.360]  Val: I personally, I do think so.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.320]  Val: I know no one else seems to share my opinion,
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.760]  Val: but I do think that she's a hacker.
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:46.520]  Val: I'm always trying to ask her to do it for some help,
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:50.240]  Val: but she's the one that introduced me to Elcomsoft.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:52.800]  Val: I said, I have this problem with the signal messages.
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:53.640]  Val: What do you recommend?
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.480]  Val: She said, Elcomsoft, ios, forensic.
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:02.040]  Fed: I don't know.
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:04.480]  Val: Again, again, right, it's too open-ended.
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:06.400]  Val: And she texted me the other day.
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:09.640]  Val: She's like, Val have you spoken to FBI,
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:11.880]  Val: I said, no, I'm not speaking to FBI.
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:14.040]  Val: She's like, well, are you sure?
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:15.280]  Val: I was like, well, I'm not lying to you.
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:17.880]  Val: I was talking to the FBI, like, you know,
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:20.360]  Val: I will let you know when I speak to FBI.
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:24.480]  Val: She said, well, you're kind of known as an FBI informant.
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:26.280]  Val: I said, well, fuck you, I'm not an informant.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:28.520]  Val: I'm a source, like, help the FBI.
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:30.680]  Val: I do not inform on anybody.
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:32.400]  Val: And then she's like, well, it's kind of the same thing.
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:33.640]  Val: And then I had to go on a tirade
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.520]  Val: to explain how it's very different.
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:38.640]  Val: So let you know that she is probably,
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:42.320]  Val: and also yesterday, one of my friends, Andrew,
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:44.280]  Val: had to defend me on this group as well,
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:47.480]  Val: because Xan was saying, you're friends
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:50.280]  Val: with a well-known FBI informant, which is me,
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:52.080]  Val: which is another allusion to me.
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.240]  Fed: So it's Xan.
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:56.480]  Fed: Oh, Xan is telling you.
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:58.800]  Val: Xan's the partner of Emma.
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.720]  Fed: So she's saying to who?
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:03.600]  Val: a friend of mine in our group.
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:06.840]  Fed: Oh, so your friend is, Xan is attacking your friend
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:07.880]  Val: for being friends with you?
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:08.880]  Val: Yes.
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:09.380]  Fed: Oh, OK.
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:09.880]  Fed: Sorry.
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:12.360]  Fed: Exactly.
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:13.360]  Fed: OK.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.920]  Fed: I mean, it's obviously a little different,
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:18.080]  Fed: and I don't know if you understand.
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:19.080]  Val: This is weird drama.
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:23.080]  Fed: It's like, yeah, there are many people with a group like that.
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:25.560]  Val: I think this, you know, I'm like 96, I think.
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:26.800]  Fed: Oh, wow.
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:29.080]  Val: That's why it's too many people.
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:31.160]  Val: And there's too many lurkers, and there's too many new
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.960]  Val: and fresh, like, minted identity,
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:36.040]  Val: so there's already a bunch of substratas,
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:38.720]  Val: and subgroups are coming from that group.
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:42.240]  Val: And what's funny is they're all, well, I mean,
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:43.480]  Val: I'll tell you, it's not a big deal.
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.240]  Val: It's with all Barrett's friends.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:48.520]  Val: Barrett's so, like, it's so weird.
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:51.400]  Val: I don't know how he does it, but he's, you know.
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:54.760]  Fed: Because you might, of the 96, you might know how many people
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:56.680]  Fed: in real life are in that group.
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:58.440]  Val: Like, what do you mean in real life.
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:01.040]  Fed: Well, I guess, like, who they really are.
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:02.880]  Val: Oh, I know about half of them.
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:03.380]  Val: Yeah.
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:05.800]  Fed: Like, into the other half, or like, lurker or something.
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:10.480]  Val: Yeah, but we have people that try and check them out
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:12.840]  Val: and figure out who these people are.
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:14.560]  Val: Like, once in a while, you'll get it right,
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.880]  Val: and we can serve it, you know, coming in there
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:20.680]  Val: and trying to spout a bunch of crazy shit, and kick him out.
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:23.040]  Val: And then, I noticed, someone loses a phone.
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:24.720]  Val: Like, it happened recently, and then all of a sudden,
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.160]  Val: we have to, it's been compromised, the FBI's in.
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.880]  Val: I'm sure you, was that you?
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.520]  Fed: I don't know.
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:31.960]  Val: Was it you?
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:32.680]  Val: Okay, somebody.
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:33.680]  Fed: I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:35.560]  Val: It was somebody.
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:41.680]  Val: Oh, and that, oh, shit, wait, Agent Ko.
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:43.160]  Val: Did you call Barrett?
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:45.640]  Val: I think he recorded a phone call with you.
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:46.480]  Fed: I haven't called Barrett.
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:47.320]  Val: You haven't called Barrett?
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:52.560]  Val: There was a different FBI agent that was trying to,
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:57.240]  Val: he was going to, I think it was some white racist,
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.560]  Val: nationalist fucking weird shit.
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.280]  Fed: And he was someone else who was working, white racist.
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:05.160]  Val: Yeah, he used to know, but I remember the name
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:07.240]  of Ko actually rings a bell.
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:09.200]  Val: And I was, I was going to tell you the other day,
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.760]  Val: but I had to figure out what it was first.
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:12.240]  Val: But now I just remembered again, I probably
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:14.760]  Val: should not be talking right now and saying it out loud,
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:17.420]  Val: but I am.
[02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:23.080]  Val: But there is something, there is something,
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:24.880]  Val: something secret.
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:25.760]  Val: Secret is going to be right now.
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:26.640]  Fed: Okay?
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:28.840]  Fed: [???] in real life?
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:32.080]  Val: No.
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:32.880]  Fed: Does he know Barrett?
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:34.400]  Fed: Have you met him in person?
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:37.000]  Val: I know, I know, I've never met in person.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.360]  Val: Oh, well, I mean, I have met, yes,
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.320]  Val: there's a few people I know personally,
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:44.400]  Val: but I can't, like my friends, I'm not gonna tell you, yeah.
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:48.480]  Fed: Getting a sense of the group, like, any other.
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:50.760]  Val: Let me show you, like, the most recent thing.
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:53.440]  Val: Let's see.
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:01.440]  Val: Ooh, someone's trying to,
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:05.680]  Val: Hey, you guys, who's trying to hack me now?
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:06.520]  Fed: You got a thing?
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:07.360]  Fed: No.
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:08.320]  Fed: Don't click on the link.
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:09.920]  Fed: What was it? What did you get?
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:11.200]  Val: No, I just got one of these things.
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:12.880]  Val: I think it's my girlfriend.
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:15.120]  Val: Who's using the other computer?
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:16.160]  Fed: Oh, he's.
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.440]  Fed: No, that's not what that says.
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:18.280]  Val: That's my girlfriend.
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:19.880]  Fed: He's finding it really fucking awesome.
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:21.000]  Val: Yeah, I know.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.440]  Val: It's, like, it's funny enough, the other computer
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.520]  Val: is Glen Simpson's.
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:27.600]  Fed: What was that?
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:29.600]  Val: Yeah, it was the Fusion GCat.
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:31.800]  Val: The Steele Dossier.
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:36.320]  Fed: I mean, like, there's a lot of stuff
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:37.160]  Fed: that I probably should know,
[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:39.800]  Fed: but I just don't, I mean, it's kind of like.
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.320]  Val: You didn't follow the Steele Dossier?
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:42.320]  Val: The whole Trump Russia?
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:43.160]  Fed: No, I did know about it,
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:44.760]  Fed: but, like, I didn't follow that much.
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:46.800]  Val: Anyway, I said, I lived at his house for a while,
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:48.400]  Val: at Glen's house, yeah.
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:49.560]  Val: And he didn't pay me half the money
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:51.560]  Val: he was supposed to, so I took the computer.
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:53.600]  Fed: Wait, is that, yeah.
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.800]  Val: Oh, and yeah, and there's a whole Russian spy thing
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:01.120]  Val: going on, too.
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:02.440]  Val: What's the Russian spy thing?
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.000]  Val: So there's, so I was telling Tim and Jami as well,
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.840]  Val: but they're sort of, they're thing, so I don't know.
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.360]  Val: Am I supposed to mix things together?
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.120]  Fed: But if Tim's aware of it, like, I would use the hot tin.
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:17.120]  Val: Let me tell Tim first.
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:17.960]  Val: Let me tell Tim first.
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:18.800]  Fed: Okay.
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:20.560]  Val: Well, I should ask him if it's okay
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.400]  Fed: Yeah, I mean, if Tim already knows about it,
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:25.960]  Fed: he would, like, I don't worry that type of stuff either,
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:28.160]  Fed: so, like, I would just tell someone else to.
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:31.160]  Val: Yeah, would he, would he tell me the, uh,
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:33.200]  Val: interior or the exterior?
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.160]  Val: Like, like, what, the United States
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:36.840]  Val: or outside of the United States?
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:39.160]  Val: Are we looking for a Russian hacker
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:41.560]  Val: or are we looking for a, everything?
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:42.400]  Val: Yeah?
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:44.640]  Val: Dude, that would be fun for me.
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:45.680]  Val: I would like to catch people.
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:47.840]  Val: I like, I can, I can do that.
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:49.840]  Val: But if money, the money is my specialty.
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:52.920]  Val: That's what I'm, better than the hacker.
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:57.520]  Fed: Cool.
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:58.360]  Fed: All right.
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.760]  Fed: Do you need to send someone for something?
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:02.000]  Val: Oh, yeah, sorry.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.600]  Val: No, I just got, I need to eat something.
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.440]  Val: My brain is...
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:06.720]  Fed: You don't think you're gonna eat something?
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.160]  Val: Yeah, could we take a cigarette break or something?
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:10.120]  Val: Is it okay?
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:10.960]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:11.800]  Val: Yeah?
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:14.640]  Val: All right, let's do it.
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:16.480]  Fed: What do you want?
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:17.760]  Val: No, no, no, I just...
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:19.280]  Fed: Yeah, I want sandwiches, then.
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:20.120]  Val: Really?
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:20.960]  Val: Yeah.
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:21.800]  Val: What kind of sandwich?
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:23.320]  Fed: A sandwich or...
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.160]  Val: Okay.
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:26.160]  Val: Sure, well, yeah, I'd love one.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:29.360]  Val: Gratsen, that's nice.
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:31.520]  Fed: I'll put on a mask or whatever.
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:33.240]  Val: Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:36.920]  Val: What was I gonna show you?
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:39.600]  Fed: At the time, you're...
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:44.560]  Val: Look, I don't know allegiance to these guys at all.
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:47.520]  Val: I mean, they've just, they've become sort of friends, but,
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:51.600]  Val: you know, as much as you can have a friend on that,
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:56.840]  Val: that doesn't tell you anything about that, right?
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:59.520]  Val: It's just sort of fun, more fun sort of.
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:03.120]  Val: Like, you're in the workplace,
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:05.840]  Val: you're not friends with all your workers, right?
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:07.160]  Val: No, I don't feel right for now.
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:11.480]  Fed: Oh, yeah, I'll hit the head, you know where it is, right?
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:12.320]  Fed: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:13.320]  Fed: You guys are just gonna go...
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:14.800]  Fed: But I'll wait for you, because you can't fit out.
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:15.640]  Fed: Oh, that's right.
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:22.600]  Val: So what's your specialty?
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:24.720]  Fed: No, same, but I just happened to work in this office.
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:25.560]  Val: In this office?
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:27.920]  Fed: Right, so, if you say, like, laundry.
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:28.760]  Val: Yeah?
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.640]  Fed: Of course, he, you know, he flew here to speak to you,
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.200]  Fed: so let him, let him, yeah, yeah, he flew here yesterday.
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:37.120]  Val: I didn't know it was just for me,
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  Val: I just thought he was coming here
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.240]  Val: and I wanted to speak to you while he was here.
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.920]  Fed: Yeah, so, for me, like, when you're in management,
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:45.840]  Fed: I'm like, oh, okay, like, a lot of these guys on the floor
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:48.560]  Fed: do, like, business email compromise, and a lot of guys,
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:49.400]  Fed: like...
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:50.240]  Val: Did you, what?
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.240]  Val: I didn't hear you.
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.480]  Fed: Business email compromise?
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:53.320]  Val: Oh, really?
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:54.840]  Val: Yeah, I don't know, okay.
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:55.960]  Val: That's easy, yeah.
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:59.120]  Fed: Yeah, so, business email compromise, and then...
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:00.080]  Val: Is that a term for it?
[02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:01.280]  Val: Just business email compromise?
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:02.440]  Val: There's a, I didn't know there was a term for it.
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:03.880]  Fed: Yeah, so a lot of things out of Nigeria,
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:05.200]  Fed: and it's just funny, when you mentioned
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:07.280]  Fed: you're not lobbying, is there a thing like...
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:09.720]  Fed: Yeah, one of our guys over here,
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:13.120]  Fed: they just got someone out of, like, Dubai,
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:14.080]  Fed: or something like that.
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:14.920]  Val: Yeah, okay.
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:15.880]  Val: Cool.
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:19.200]  Fed: And they're digging into that versus something like,
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:21.520]  Fed: they're specialty is, like, laundering,
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:22.600]  Fed: laundering money, right?
[02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:25.480]  Fed: So, like, romance, victim, romance scam victims,
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:26.560]  Fed: like a victimized...
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.480]  Val: Oh, yeah, I heard that.
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:31.520]  Fed: Eventually, he gets out to, like, Canada, China,
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:32.640]  Fed: or all these other countries,
[02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:34.840]  Fed: and there's, like, a whole money mule network
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:36.240]  Fed: that's, like, pretty tough to...
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.080]  Val: Is it really?
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:37.920]  Val: Is it like a company?
[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.080]  Val: Is it one person behind it, or is it...
[02:51:39.080 --> 02:51:41.520]  Fed: No, no, no, it's all a loose connection, yeah.
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:42.360]  Fed: Loose.
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:43.200]  Val: Interesting.
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:46.800]  Val: It's like a, like, a lead in welding connections
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:50.960]  Val: sort of thing, like, there was a...
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:52.960]  Fed: Basically, like, very, very...
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:54.200]  Fed: And they all know each other in person,
[02:51:54.200 --> 02:51:55.040]  Fed: that's the difference.
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:55.880]  Val: Oh, they do?
[02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:56.720]  Fed: They know each other, it's like,
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:57.560]  Fed: oh, you know this guy?
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:00.040]  Fed: He's leading, interested in, you know,
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:03.080]  Fed: doing some work, opening bank accounts, and stuff like that.
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:04.640]  Fed: Ah, I understand that, yeah.
[02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:07.440]  Val: So, like, they're friends in Nigeria?
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:09.440]  Fed: Or in the community?
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.440]  Val: Shit, you know we did?
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:14.400]  Val: Marie had to, like, this lawyer was such an asshole.
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:18.040]  Val: He said, we need your narrative of your story ASAP for Monday. [Money?]
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:21.120]  Val: So, I went on the Fiverr, and I tried to find it.
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:21.960]  Fed: Oh, Fiverr.
[02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:24.120]  Val: It's a narrative of Marie's story.
[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:25.320]  Fed: Fiverr.
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:26.800]  Val: So, I went on Fiverr?
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:27.640]  Fed: Oh, sure.
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:31.080]  Val: I went on Fiverr.
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:31.920]  Fed: Really?
[02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:35.320]  Val: I found someone to do a live transcription
[02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:36.800]  Val: and it's a Nigerian guy.
[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:40.120]  Val: He wanted to be paid in Bitcoin yesterday or tomorrow.
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:42.960]  Val: And Marie says, no, I'm not gonna pay you that.
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:45.440]  Val: And then he says, okay, and that's it.
[02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:50.440]  Val: So, I'm thinking, well, he just got all of Marie's
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:52.440]  Val: information since she was a child.
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:55.440]  Val: So, he should probably pay the guy, right?
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:57.280]  Val: It's a new scam, I think.
[02:52:57.280 --> 02:52:58.560]  Val: You're doing transcription services,
[02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:01.360]  Val: get your private data, and then sell that data.
[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:02.960]  Fed: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:04.480]  Fed: Nigerian's committing fraud.
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:05.320]  Fed: What do you mean?
[02:53:07.320 --> 02:53:10.080]  Val: Like crazy, you know, connoisseurs, yes.
[02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:13.920]  Fed: I mean, they're in that rush, they're doing good stuff.
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:17.800]  Val: Why isn't that, why is that the hotbed here,
[02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:19.320]  Val: criminal activity?
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:22.240]  Fed: I don't know, it's what's called like training, you know?
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:23.080]  Fed: Training stuff.
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:23.920]  Fed: You're gonna wait here real quick?
[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:24.760]  Fed: Okay.
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:28.320]  Fed: You think they train each other and like,
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:29.960]  Fed: you know, it's like, hey, you know,
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:31.640]  Fed: you grow up with all these people and like,
[02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:33.840]  Fed: hey, you want to make a cash and then they say,
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:35.840]  Fed: all you gotta do is you send out these emails,
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:37.640]  Fed: there's this script and whatever,
[02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:39.080]  Fed: and then they teach other people.
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:42.720]  Fed: It's like any other criminal organization.
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:44.240]  Fed: That's the way it works, it's all good.
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:46.000]  Fed: Right now, I guess they're,
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.120]  Fed: I haven't been looking around right here,
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:48.880]  Fed: but they're like in protest right now?
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:49.720]  Fed: Oh, really?
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:52.200]  Fed: I don't see anything, so Pat's gonna cut it off.
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:53.040]  Fed: I'm gonna say there's no, like,
[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:54.800]  Fed: see any signers or whatever.
[02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:56.440]  Val: Yeah, that'd be bad.
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:53:57.280]  Fed: Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:58.280]  Val: Yeah, I don't know why that.
[02:53:58.280 --> 02:53:59.120]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:02.640]  Fed: Huh.
[02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:03.840]  Val: Where are they protesting?
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:06.440]  Val: There's the answer, you know?
[02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:09.800]  Val: Don't join, Val.
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:11.320]  Val: Don't do it, don't do it.
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:14.800]  Val: You guys get a bad rap, you know?
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:16.760]  Val: Like seriously, I was like everybody else
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:18.520]  Val: until I met Tim and Jammy.
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:19.360]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.200]  Val: And then I was like, you know,
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.040]  Val: I can't believe I considered you guys [unintelligible] guys.
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:25.120]  Fed: What are you doing here, dude?
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:27.760]  Fed: You just being careful on me, yeah.
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.680]  Val: How'd you guys get started on this?
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:31.920]  Fed: I don't know, I just started a little while ago.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:33.440]  Fed: I always wanted to do it as a kid.
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:34.280]  Val: Yeah?
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:35.520]  Fed: Here I am, so I'm talking to Dad.
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:36.840]  Val: Did you good do the whole training
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:38.840]  Val: and either you taught you everything now
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:40.000]  Val: or did you know before?
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  Fed: Not much, not much.
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.360]  Fed: Oh, for the computer stuff I went to,
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:45.880]  Fed: my degree is in there.
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:46.720]  Val: Oh, it is?
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:47.560]  Fed: I don't know about that.
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.960]  Fed: I'm like, oh no, but yeah,
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:51.200]  Fed: [unintelligible] I want to do it as a kid
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:54.600]  Fed: and then easily enough, you just apply online, everything.
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:55.640]  Val: Yeah.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:58.400]  Fed: Yeah, so it's not like you know a guy or whatever.
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:54:59.760]  Fed: No, that's cool, that's cool.
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:00.600]  Val: Interesting.
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:01.440]  Fed: How lucky.
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:03.000]  Fed: That's good.

[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:03.960]  Val: Here, I'll give you a quick peep.
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:06.080]  Val: This is what it's like, you can scroll around.
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:08.720]  Val: It's not that, it's not a cool, great, crazy data
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:11.080]  Val: that I keep, it's not what you think.
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:11.920]  Fed: Cool.
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:23.000]  Fed: Doc Rockett
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:23.840]  Val: What's wrong?

[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:25.560]  Fed: Doc Rockett

[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:27.600]  Fed: I assume these are not like real people, right?
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:28.920]  Val: No, they're not real people.
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:31.480]  Fed: I mean, they're not their real names.
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:34.480]  Val: Some of them, I mean, I use my real name.
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:35.480]  Fed: That's your friend.
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:36.760]  Val: I use his real name.
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:37.600]  Fed: Oh.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:39.360]  Val: I think Barrett uses his real name.
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:42.240]  Val: Conlon, I don't know, kind of, Doc Rockett is a,
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:44.840]  Val: I can't remember, I used to read through it again.
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:46.240]  Val: I used to know what everybody was, but.
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:47.920]  Fed: He's too many secrets, you know?
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:50.080]  Val: Oh, that guy's great, yeah, I do.
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:53.880]  Val: He doesn't do anything illegal.
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:56.240]  Val: He's like, he's just like a researcher.
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:57.640]  Val: He's not even that good.
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:55:59.360]  Val: He's got a couple of databases in there.
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:01.240]  Val: He's just very loyal and helpful.
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:03.880]  Val: So if anyone needs my help, I'll do that.
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.520]  Val: Kind of nice thing.
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.920]  Fed: So there are no film crews outside,
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:08.760]  Fed: but you never know.
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:11.640]  Fed: They could show up to your comfort level.
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:12.480]  Val: Okay, let's go.
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:15.160]  Fed: At the same time, the protest is like
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:17.920]  Fed: about salons wanting to open.
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:19.040]  Val:  That's what, salons?
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:20.240]  Fed: Yeah, like salons.
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:21.560]  Val: Okay.
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:22.400]  Val: Cool.
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:23.240]  Val: Let's join.
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:24.240]  Fed: A bit of a carry.
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:26.440]  Fed: Oh, that's what we really did there.
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:27.760]  Fed: Oh, thank you.
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:30.040]  Val: That was pretty good, though.
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:31.560]  Val: I mean, I give you credit.
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:38.080]  Val: God, it's split ends.
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:39.400]  Val: Okay, there you go.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.440]  Val: So yeah, it's not that it's fun.
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:46.920]  Val: It's mostly just people yelling.
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:49.040]  Val: During like, you know, Joe,
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:50.520]  Val: I'm sure you know Joe Fionda.
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:53.080]  Fed: Who's Joe Fionda?
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:55.040]  Val: Joe is like, what's his name?
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:56.440]  Val: Sub-Zero?
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:57.360]  Val: Sub-Zero?
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:58.200]  Val: Was his name?
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:00.040]  Val: I think in 2000.
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:01.520]  Fed: I'm talking about the mortal kombat character.
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:02.360]  Val: I don't know.
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:03.200]  Val: I don't know.
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:04.040]  Val: It's his name.
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:04.880]  Val: His alias.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:07.480]  Val: He's pretty, he's a clever guy.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:08.520]  Val: He was in the,
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:09.720]  Val: did you see the Hacker War film?
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:12.040]  Val: That's the film that women did with Barrett.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:16.720]  Val: It's basically the guy that's talking all the time.
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:18.920]  Val: And wearing a suit, that guy.
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.000]  Fed: Okay.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.040]  Fed: Joe, is he a hacker?
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:24.920]  Val: I think, yeah, he's like a, yeah.
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:25.880]  Fed: Okay.
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:27.520]  Fed: So he's like, he's friends with Barrett.
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:28.920]  Fed: Is that how he got in the group?
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:31.320]  Val: Yeah, these old friends of Barrett.
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:32.160]  Fed: Cool.
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:35.240]  Val: He's one of his old friends of Barrett, man.
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:36.960]  Fed: So what did Joe do?
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.280]  Val: Joe, I'm not quite sure.
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.360]  Val: I think he goes cycling a lot.
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:43.880]  Val: He spends most of his time cycling
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:44.720]  Val: during the year.
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:47.600]  Val: He's a, everyone,
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:49.880]  Val: but these guys are fairly activism, you know,
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:52.200]  Val: based, which is great and all.
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:54.880]  Val: I'm not really a, you know,
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:57.320]  Val: I mean, I guess I don't believe anything that strongly
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:59.080]  Val: to go out and carry a sign.
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:57:59.920]  Fed: Sure.
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:01.880]  Val: But I'm sure, you know,
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:06.600]  Val: I mean, if someone DCFS right now,
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:08.520]  Val: of course, I think I would probably carry a sign.
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:11.000]  Val: So I'm like, it hasn't hit me personally yet.
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:14.960]  Fed: I mean, that's a really popular corner.
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:15.800]  Val: Yeah, wow.
[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:17.040]  Fed: Just because it's like one of the,
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:17.880]  Fed: you hear it over there.
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:19.200]  Val: Yeah, this would be okay.
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:21.960]  Val: It's really far away.
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:32.920]  Fed: I can push a little bit over there.
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:33.760]  Val: Sure.
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:36.600]  Val: Oh, really?
[02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:37.440]  Val: Oh, man.
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:42.400]  Val: So, yeah, I mean, just like everyone,
[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:43.520]  Val: the people who use their real names
[02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:46.080]  Val: really aren't afraid of the guy finding out.
[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:48.120]  Val: So, I'm sure you, yeah.
[02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:53.600]  Val: But the, yeah, there was another interesting thing.
[02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:56.880]  Val: God, I can't remember why they said Ko.
[02:58:57.160 --> 02:58:59.000]  Val: I'm running to show you the thing.
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:00.320]  Fed: I can almost guarantee you.
[02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:02.840]  Fed: It's not me, because I'm not that important.
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:04.800]  Val: No, but you were from Houston,
[02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:06.800]  Val: and Barrett said it was a guy from Houston
[02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:08.680]  Val: that called a friend of his
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:10.720]  Val: that was trying to infiltrate some group,
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:12.040]  Val: but he was on the wrong group.
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:14.040]  Val: I don't know exactly what happened.
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:15.200]  Val: We got a recording of the phone call.
[02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:16.520]  Val: I wanted to play back the phone call
[02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:18.640]  Val: to see if that was you talking to this other guy.
[02:59:18.640 --> 02:59:20.240]  Val: Not Barrett directly, but someone else.
[02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:22.040]  Fed: I would be interested if you got a recording
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:23.400]  Fed: of me talking to someone.
[02:59:23.400 --> 02:59:24.240]  Fed: I'd love to hear it..
[02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:29.280]  Val: Yeah, that's what ??? with Ko

[02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:32.880]  Val: Okay.
Fed: [unintelligible]
[02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:40.640]  Val: Now, could you, is it possible that,
[02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:46.640]  Val: is it possible to have this guy,
[02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:48.080]  Val: that you've done your research,
[02:59:48.080 --> 02:59:50.560]  Val: you probably understand that Steve is not a good guy?
[02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:51.400]  Fed: Who's Steve.
[02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:52.240]  Val: Steve Toltz?
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:55.080]  Fed: You've posted here on Facebook.
[02:59:55.080 --> 02:59:58.880]  Val: Yeah, like he's not a stand-up guy.
[02:59:58.880 --> 02:59:59.720]  Val: He's not a,
[03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:04.960]  Val: you know the type that's run to mom and the scribbling.
[03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:05.960]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[03:00:08.480 --> 03:00:11.360]  Val: I think it's actually really become a threat
[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:15.320]  Val: to not only to Marlowe's update with the priest,
[03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:16.480]  Val: the priest that's happening.
[03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:17.480]  Fed: Sure, no, I get it.
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:21.240]  Val: Is it possible to have him deported?
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:23.080]  Fed: No.
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:27.520]  Val: Australia.
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:34.680]  Val: I went to a whole moral crisis.
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:36.920]  Val: Did I do this or not?
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:39.400]  Val: And I asked them, they said they'd do it.
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:40.240]  Val: But then I said,
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:41.520]  Val: but then all of a sudden I had this father,
[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:43.080]  Val: I said, we're not going to do that tomorrow.
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:44.840]  Val: That was the bottom line.
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:46.000]  Val: But that was last year.
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  Val: Yeah, that was last year.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.080]  Val: But now everyone's really asking me,
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:51.040]  Val: I know.
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:53.360]  Fed: Thank you.
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:54.360]  Val: Thank you.
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:01.720]  Fed: You're welcome.
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:02.720]  Fed: I am the broker.
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:04.160]  Fed: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:06.200]  Fed: You actually thought about it.
[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:08.640]  Fed: I was like, I'm not fucking one out.
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:09.920]  Fed: I was like, you know,
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:12.040]  Fed: don't look at me, I did it on the right.
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:13.440]  Fed: I did, I did it on the right.
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:14.440]  Fed: That's all I got.
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:17.440]  Fed: It's a little bit economic.
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:20.440]  Fed: Because I was shopping in one town,
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:23.440]  Fed: and this was like twice that.
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:25.440]  Fed: I'm like, if you guys really eat it,
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:26.440]  Fed: I can eat for a week.
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:27.440]  Fed: That's true.
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:36.440]  Fed: I don't think you guys realize how nice this weather is
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:38.440]  Fed: for August, whatever.
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:40.440]  Val: Do you know Andrew?
[03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:41.440]  Fed: I don't like this weather.
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:43.440]  Val: Do you know Andrew?
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:44.440]  Val: Who's Andrew?
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:46.440]  Val: The one you pointed out, my friend.
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:47.440]  Fed: Your friend?
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:48.440]  Val: Yeah.
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:49.440]  Fed: I mean, you just told me about him,
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:50.440]  Fed: but I don't know.
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:52.440]  Val: Before I mentioned him.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:54.440]  Val: He's a good, interesting character.
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:55.440]  Fed: What's the deal?
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:56.440]  Val: He's a really good guy.
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:57.440]  Val: Good dude.
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:01:59.440]  Val: Do you remember, maybe,
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:03.440]  Val: probably in 2015 there was this article
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:06.440]  Val: in Bloomberg about
[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:08.440]  Val: if there was this company,
[03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:09.440]  Val: and it turned out later,
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:11.440]  Val: you find out articles later,
[03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:14.440]  Val: that it was a Russian company,
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:16.440]  Val: they created this big debts for people.
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:17.440]  Val: Someone would call you and say,
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:19.440]  Val: you owe us $2,000 a month,
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:21.440]  Val: and then you say,
[03:02:21.440 --> 03:02:22.440]  Val: you got this thing,
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:23.440]  Val: you forgot about it,
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:24.440]  Val: you should probably pay it.
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:26.440]  Val: Most people will pay that money.
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:29.440]  Val: If you will just create this big debt,
[03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  Val: and it's a really fucking dollar,
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:33.440]  Val: and it's $1,000,000 a month.
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:35.440]  Val: So a lot of people would take advantage
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:36.440]  Val: and people would just be doing that.
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:38.440]  Val: And they'd try to get it to Andrews.
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:39.440]  Val: They wouldn't call Andrew,
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:41.440]  Val: and they'd say, you owe us $5,000,
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:42.440]  Val: we're a combination of debts,
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:43.440]  Val: and he'd say,
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:44.440]  Val: No I don't,
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:45.440]  Val: I remember paying that back,
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:47.440]  Val: ???
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:49.440]  Val: So he starts fighting and arguing with this guy,
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:51.440]  Val: until the guy threatens to go
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:53.440]  Val: and rape his wife.
[03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:54.440]  Val: Like, totally possible,
[03:02:54.440 --> 03:02:55.440]  Val: and Andrew said,
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:56.440]  Val: that's it.
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:02:58.440]  Val: So he starts doing like,
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:02:59.440]  Val: he's now,
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:02.440]  Val: he's the Liam Neeson thing,
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:04.440]  Val: I have three,
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:05.440]  Val: you know,
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:07.440]  Val: a few good things,
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:08.440]  Val: whatever the line is.
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:09.440]  Val: And that's what he does.
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:10.440]  Val: So you reverse engineers,
[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:11.440]  Val: it's brilliant what he did,
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:12.440]  Val: I love it.
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:13.440]  Val: Reverse engineers,
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:14.440]  Val: everyone that's called him,
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:15.440]  Val: and looks him up,
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:16.440]  Val: there's all the background on them,
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:19.440]  Val: gets them to give up more information on their,
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:21.440]  Val: just like you could do in any case.
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:22.440]  Val: You know,
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:23.440]  Val: give information to the guy at mob,
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:24.440]  Val: and the hierarchy,
[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:26.440]  Val: all the way up to Weldon,
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:27.440]  Val: the congressman,
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:29.440]  Val: was he a senator or congressman?
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:31.440]  Fed: Well, I'm a senator or something.
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:32.440]  Val: Is he Weldon?
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:33.440]  Val: No,
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:34.440]  Val: Josh Weldon,
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:36.440]  Val: or is he something Weldon?
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:37.440]  Val: Yeah, man,
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:38.440]  Fed: I don't know all the senators
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.440]  Fed: and representatives,
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:40.440]  Fed: so I'm a bad,
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:41.440]  Fed: he's an ???
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:42.440]  Fed: But,
[03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:43.440]  Val: I mean,
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:44.440]  Val: he might be,
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:45.440]  Val: he might be actually,
[03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:46.440]  Fed: I know he's a congressman person,
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:47.440]  Fed: but that's about the extent of my knowledge
[03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:48.440]  Fed: I know.
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:49.440]  Val: Yeah,
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:50.440]  Val: but he's in bed with a lot of,
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:51.440]  Val: the Russian companies,
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:53.440]  Val: they're creating these fake debt companies,
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:55.440]  Val: and it's a really good story,
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:03:56.440]  Val: it's great articles,
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:57.440]  Val: and it's just sort of reverse engineers,
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:03:58.440]  Val: put some in jail,
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:00.440]  Val: and it's a good guy at the store.
[03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:01.440]  Val: It's very impressed.
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:02.440]  Fed: That's cool.
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:03.440]  Val: I mean,
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:04.440]  Val: he found me,
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:05.440]  Val: he just wanted to know
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:06.440]  Val: if I had any data
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:07.440]  Val: on those people as well,
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.440]  Val: like,
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:09.440]  Val: I was looking for Weldon,
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:10.440]  Val: the Russians,
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:11.440]  Val: the Tudmento[???]
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:13.440]  Val: or some other guy,
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:15.440]  Val: and that's how we became friends.
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:16.440]  Val: He's a good guy.
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:17.440]  Fed: That's cool.
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:19.440]  Val: I thought he was already working with you guys.
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:20.440]  Val: I'm pretty sure he was,
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:21.440]  Val: I thought he was CIA.
[03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:22.440]  Fed: Okay,
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:23.440]  Fed: I mean,
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:24.440]  Fed: so if he was CIA then,
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:25.440]  Fed: I don't think he would.
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:26.440]  Val: That's what I thought.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:27.440]  Val: I don't know.
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:28.440]  Fed: Have you ever met him
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:29.440]  Fed: like,
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:30.440]  Fed: okay.
[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:31.440]  Val: Yeah,
[03:04:31.440 --> 03:04:32.440]  Val: he came out to visit.
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:33.440]  Fed: I don't know,
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:35.440]  Fed: do you think he'd want to work with us?
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:36.440]  Val: I think he would.
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:37.440]  Val: I think he would,
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:38.440]  Val: actually.
[03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:40.440]  Fed: Do you want to give me his contact information?
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:42.440]  Val: I think I'd have to ask him.
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:43.440]  Fed: Okay.
[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:44.440]  Val: And then,
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:45.440]  Val: if he'd never have to,
[03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:46.440]  Val: I'd bring it up.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:47.440]  Val: Because I don't know,
[03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:48.440]  Val: he's like a,
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:49.440]  Val: like a really,
[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:52.440]  Val: he almost pisses me off,
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:53.440]  Val: he's like,
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:54.440]  Val: too good.
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:55.440]  Val: He's like,
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:04:57.440]  Val: he reminds me of my father in the sense
[03:04:57.440 --> 03:04:58.440]  Val: of his morality.
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:04:59.440]  Val: He's very,
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:00.440]  Val: very strong.
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:01.440]  Fed: That's good.
[03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:02.440]  Val: So that's the thing you guys like,
[03:05:02.440 --> 03:05:03.440]  Val: I mean,
[03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:04.440]  Val: you hire a lot of,
[03:05:04.440 --> 03:05:05.440]  Val: like,
[03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:06.440]  Val: Mormons, right?
[03:05:06.440 --> 03:05:07.440]  Val: So,
[03:05:07.440 --> 03:05:08.440]  Val: or is that the CIA?
[03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:10.440]  Val: Who's hiring all the Mormons?
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:12.440]  Fed: They're doing a lot of good things.
[03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:13.440]  Val: Yeah, okay.
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:14.440]  Fed: If they can pass the drug test,
[03:05:14.440 --> 03:05:15.440]  Fed: yeah.
[03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:16.440]  Val: Okay,
[03:05:16.440 --> 03:05:17.440]  Val: really the Mormons
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:18.440]  Val: can't pass the drug test?
[03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:19.440]  Val: That's great.
[03:05:19.440 --> 03:05:20.440]  Fed: Because they can't.
[03:05:20.440 --> 03:05:21.440]  Val: They cannot.
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:22.440]  Fed: No, they can't.
[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:23.440]  Fed: Oh, they can't,
[03:05:23.440 --> 03:05:24.440]  Val: right?
[03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:25.440]  Val: Yeah.
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:26.440]  Val: Okay,
[03:05:26.440 --> 03:05:27.440]  Val: okay.
[03:05:27.440 --> 03:05:28.440]  Fed: I mean,
[03:05:28.440 --> 03:05:29.440]  Fed: the Mormons
[03:05:29.440 --> 03:05:30.440]  Fed: a lot of time,
[03:05:30.440 --> 03:05:31.440]  Fed: they do missions.
[03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:32.440]  Fed: So when they go overseas,
[03:05:32.440 --> 03:05:33.440]  Fed: they learn the language,
[03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:34.440]  Fed: it's probably useful
[03:05:34.440 --> 03:05:35.440]  Fed: for like,
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:36.440]  Fed: CIA and all that kind of stuff.
[03:05:36.440 --> 03:05:37.440]  Val: Right,
[03:05:37.440 --> 03:05:38.440]  Val: good cover.
[03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:39.440]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:40.440]  Val: Yeah,
[03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:41.440]  Val: but it's so,
[03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:42.440]  Val: like,
[03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:43.440]  Val: we're so
[03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:44.440]  Val: strict with rules
[03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:45.440]  Val: and stuff.
[03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:46.440]  Val: How do you,
[03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:47.440]  Val: how do you,
[03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:48.440]  Val: justify one thing
[03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:49.440]  Val: or do something else?
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:50.440]  Fed: That's a good question.
[03:05:50.440 --> 03:05:51.440]  Fed: That's something
[03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:52.440]  Fed: I've,
[03:05:52.440 --> 03:05:53.440]  Fed: know nothing about.
[03:05:53.440 --> 03:05:54.440]  Val: Right.
[03:05:54.440 --> 03:05:55.440]  Fed: Well,
[03:05:55.440 --> 03:05:56.440]  Fed: being a Mormon
[03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:57.440]  Fed: won't work for the agency.
[03:05:57.440 --> 03:05:58.440]  Fed: Like,
[03:05:58.440 --> 03:05:59.440]  Fed: how do you justify,
[03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:14.440]  Val: What do you guys
[03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:15.440]  Val: do?
[03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:16.440]  Val: Jesus,
[03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:17.440]  Val: people?
[03:06:17.440 --> 03:06:18.440]  Val: Can't say that.
[03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:19.440]  Val: Okay.
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:20.440]  Val: Do it or not do it?
[03:06:20.440 --> 03:06:21.440]  Fed: No.
[03:06:21.440 --> 03:06:22.440]  Fed: I wish there was.
[03:06:28.440 --> 03:06:34.440]  Val: That's what's more impressive, what you need for me right away is the thing that you have on your plate.
[03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:40.440]  Val: What I can help you with, what you can do with the transactional for Marlowe's safety.
[03:06:40.440 --> 03:06:44.440]  Val: I would like to bro it, Steve.
[03:06:44.440 --> 03:06:46.440]  Val: Listen to me, sir.
[03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:48.440]  Thank you.
[03:06:54.440 --> 03:06:56.440]  Fed: Seriously, it caught me up.
[03:06:56.440 --> 03:06:58.440]  Val: Are you happy?
[03:06:58.440 --> 03:07:00.440]  Fed: Maybe.
[03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:02.440]  Fed: You've got to take off that pavilion.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:04.440]  Val: Thank you.
[03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:06.440]  Val: Thank you very much.
[03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:08.440]  You're welcome.
[03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:10.440]  I like the economy with our mayor.
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:12.440]  That's right.
[03:07:12.440 --> 03:07:16.440]  Val: I'm going to watch out for the Marie.
[03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:34.440]  Val: I would have to be really secretive if I now tell Marie.
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:36.440]  Val: I can't tell her everything.
[03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:40.440]  Val: What I don't tell her, she always finds out.
[03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:42.440]  Fed: What would you tell her?
[03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:48.440]  Val: I'm going to tell her, oh they offered me a job.
[03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:52.440]  Val: She'd be like, what are they paying down?
[03:07:52.440 --> 03:07:54.440]  Val: Not money.
[03:07:54.440 --> 03:07:56.440]  Val: It's a good job.
[03:07:56.440 --> 03:07:58.440]  Val: But they will have Marlowe.
[03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:00.440]  Val: They should say, trust them.
[03:08:00.440 --> 03:08:02.440]  Val: You can live with them.
[03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:04.440]  Val: See that?
[unintelligible]
03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:14.440]  Val: She'll see you working on it.
[03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:16.440]  Val: What are you doing?
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:18.440]  Val: Okay, thanks.
[03:08:18.440 --> 03:08:20.440]  Val: I'll see you later.
[03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:28.440]  Val: It's fun to do an episode
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:32.440]  Val: But I don't know how people will know.
[03:08:32.440 --> 03:08:34.440]  Val: I figured it was okay to do an episode 7 today.
[03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:36.440]  Val: It was a bit rainy.
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:38.440]  Val: But she said it was not.
[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:40.440]  Val: It was a lie.
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:44.440]  Val: A lot of stuff was in French.
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:48.440]  Val: Which brings me to a good point.
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:50.440]  Val: So I was afraid to look at it.
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:52.440]  Val: I don't understand what it meant.
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:54.440]  Val: Just to take a look at it.
[03:08:54.440 --> 03:08:56.440]  Val: at the hard drive, right?
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:00.440]  Val: That's concerning.
[03:09:00.440 --> 03:09:02.440]  Val: So that's why I just ran it over.
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:04.440]  Val: I'll forward it to you.
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:06.440]  Val: That's what I said to David.
[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:08.440]  Val: I don't know.
[03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:10.440]  Val: I would really like to use that against him somehow.
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:12.440]  Val: I'm trying to do that.
[03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:14.440]  Val: I don't know if it's legal for me to give him that.
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:16.440]  Val: But what he does it with an afterward.
[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:18.440]  Val: I don't know.
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:20.440]  Fed: I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:22.440]  Fed: It's hard.
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:24.440]  Fed: It's hard to say.
[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:28.440]  Fed: But it's definitely hard to do what he did.
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:34.440]  Fed: So before the musician stuff, were you involved with computers?
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:36.440]  Fed: [unintelligible]
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:42.440]  Val: I'm just a musician.
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:44.440]  Val: I used to play football and having...
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:46.440]  Val: Sorry, I didn't go to it.
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:48.440]  Val: I see.
[03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:52.440]  Val: And there was a guy who lived above me in London.
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:54.440]  Fed: He lived in London above you.
[03:09:54.440 --> 03:09:56.440]  Val: He was really good at hacking
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:09:58.440]  Val: He gave me a list of all that.
[03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:00.440]  Val: [IP?] addresses [?]
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:02.440]  Val: He'd be a good guy.
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:04.440]  Val: He'd just have fun and see me.
[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.440]  Val: You could tell that or something.
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:08.440]  Val: And he's the one who said,
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:10.440]  Val: I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:12.440]  Val: And at times it's like $30.
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:14.440]  Val: I mean, I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:18.440]  Val: I want to spend $30 on some bullshit.
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:20.440]  Fed: I would have bought pizza.
[03:10:20.440 --> 03:10:22.440]  Fed: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:26.440]  Val: Well, that was about the sound of it,
[03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:28.440]  Val: but I mean, I was really focused.
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:30.440]  Val: I have 36 hours to do the single.
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:32.440]  Val: It's been all my time.
[03:10:32.440 --> 03:10:34.440]  Fed: A lot of work.
[03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:36.440]  Val: A lot of work.
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:38.440]  Val: You know, I don't do that anymore.
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:40.440]  Fed: Really?
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:42.440]  Fed: Do you miss it?
[03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:44.440]  Val: I mean, I miss lifestyle.
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:48.440]  Val: No.
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:50.440]  Val: I don't.
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:52.440]  Fed: I don't have music,
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:54.440]  Fed: but I think I do.
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:56.440]  Fed: I don't.
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:10:58.440]  Fed: Cross our lifestyle.
[03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:00.440]  Val: Yeah, but you got to stop at some points.
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:02.440]  Val: You can't be the other guy doing that.
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:04.440]  Fed: Yeah, there's a lot of things.
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:06.440]  Fed: It's not like it's still going on.
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:08.440]  Val: Yeah, but still, it's a little creepy.
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:10.440]  Val: We were at a party.
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:12.440]  Val: We didn't see what's happening.
[03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:14.440]  Val: What's the name of the meeting?
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:16.440]  Val: I didn't talk to him.
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:18.440]  Val: I was like, what's the change that you're doing here?
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:20.440]  Val: You just get out of rehab.
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:22.440]  Val: That's where he's supposed to not do it.
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:24.440]  Val: He's like, let's go get a drink.
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:26.440]  Val: And whatever.
[03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:28.440]  Val: It's all like rehab.
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:30.440]  Val: Things are supposed to not do it.
[03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:32.440]  Val: So, you guys,
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:34.440]  Val: we're having everything.
[03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:36.440]  Val: We got the idea.
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:40.440]  Val: There's a lot of rules.
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:42.440]  Val: We're not supposed to be that broad.
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:44.440]  Val: But first you're out.
[03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:46.440]  Val: You got laid and be manipulative.
[03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:48.440]  Val: Because we don't have your drugs here.
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:50.440]  Val: You're trying to compensate.
[03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:52.440]  Fed: I don't know.
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:54.440]  Fed: We'll never realize that.
[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:58.440]  Fed: So you're not allowed to date at all after rehab?
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:00.440]  Val: No.
[03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:02.440]  Val: No, because love is like a drug.
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:04.440]  Val: You'll get that serotonin or that dopamine
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:06.440]  Val: that you don't have for your drug.
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:08.440]  Val: So, the relationship will fill it up for you.
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:10.440]  Val: But you're always going to end tragically
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:12.440]  Val: because once you're speaking away.
[03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:14.440]  Val: It's like what you're going to do.
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:16.440]  Val: I'm going to act strong.
[03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:18.440]  Val: I'm going to act strong.
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:20.440]  Val: That's what I'm going to do.
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:22.440]  Val: We'll just talk about that.
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:24.440]  Fed: You don't want to do it?
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:26.440]  Val: No.
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:28.440]  Val: It depends.
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:30.440]  Val: You want to or you want to.
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:32.440]  Val: If you just don't want to.
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:34.440]  Val: If you're stuck with it.
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:36.440]  Val: You have to.
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:38.440]  Val: I mean, I did.
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:40.440]  Val: Well, first of all, Muzza,
[03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:42.440]  Val: he's called Nick.
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:44.440]  Val: We need you to stay at this rehab
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:46.440]  Val: but we figure out everything
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:48.440]  Val: through your mopsie.
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:50.440]  Val: If you don't know anything about Muzza
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:52.440]  Val: or if you don't know anything about Muzza
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:54.440]  Val: you might want to stay out here.
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:56.440]  Val: I was banned from the UK for three years.
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:58.440]  Val: I've never stayed with him.
[03:12:58.440 --> 03:13:00.440]  Val: Nothing's relationship.
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:02.440]  Val: So, stay the year in the California
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:04.440]  Val: in this rehab.
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:06.440]  Val: We'll figure out the next move.
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:08.440]  Val: And that's when I realized
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:10.440]  Val: that I had to learn really fast
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:12.440]  Val: for my mother.
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:14.440]  Val: Well, the Buddha taught me.
[03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:16.440]  Val: She got my dad.
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:18.440]  Val: She threw out my dad.
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:20.440]  Val: Not the people, literally.
[03:13:20.440 --> 03:13:22.440]  Val: But he signed it.
[03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:24.440]  Val: But in the New York state
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:26.440]  Val: he agreed.
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:28.440]  Val: So, it's not up to her to throw that.
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:30.440]  Val: So, she landed in the fall of 2004
[03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:32.440]  Val: where she gets everything.
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:34.440]  Val: She's very smart.
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:36.440]  Val: And I didn't know anything about finance.
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:38.440]  Val: But she's doing something that's happening
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:40.440]  Val: where you can learn fast.
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:42.440]  Val: So, that's why I learned finance.
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:46.440]  Val: When you're desperate
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:48.440]  Val: and you have to face off
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:50.440]  Val: and get nothing to lose
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:52.440]  Val: you find like you have intelligence
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:54.440]  Val: and everything.
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:56.440]  Val: Really, everyone has it.
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:58.440]  Val: I think it's the current everybody.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:00.440]  Val: If you can get rid of the emotion
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:02.440]  Val: because emotion sort of clogs you up
[03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:04.440]  Val: then you can get more free
[03:14:04.440 --> 03:14:06.440]  Val: and free of focus.
[03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:08.440]  Val: It's emotion that really blocks the emotions.
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:10.440]  Val: And emotion is important of course
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:12.440]  Val: but you also need the emotion to
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.440]  Val: connect with someone to understand
[03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:16.440]  Val: but you don't need it all the time.
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:18.440]  Val: You need to control it.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:20.440]  Val: It's the greatest freedom.
Fed: [unintelligible]
[03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:24.440]  Val: Well, drugs.
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:26.440]  Val: Drugs help a lot.
[03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:28.440]  Val: When they train you, you can do it without drugs.
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:30.440]  Val: But at first, no, you can't.
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:32.440]  Val: But you're such an emotional mess.
[03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:34.440]  Val: So, you take the drug
[03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:36.440]  Val: which calms you down and makes you feel
[03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:38.440]  Val: like it's making you focus.
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:40.440]  Val: Like I was not crying.
[03:14:40.440 --> 03:14:42.440]  Val: I was not keeping my father.
[03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:44.440]  Val: And it's a reminder that
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:46.440]  Val: that part exists.
[03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:48.440]  Val: It's when you're pressing that existing
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:50.440]  Val: to get it back.
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:52.440]  Val: So, you just remind yourself that,
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:54.440]  Val: yeah, I was free once.
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:56.440]  Val: So, you have it.
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:14:58.440]  Val: So,
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:00.440]  Val: you can then exchange it.
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:02.440]  Val: And you can actually say,
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:04.440]  Val: wait, is that
[03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:06.440]  Val: is that my thinking?
[03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:08.440]  Val: Is this you?
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:10.440]  Val: Is that my question for you?
[03:15:10.440 --> 03:15:12.440]  Val: Is this certain?
[03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:14.440]  Val: That's the purpose of this.
[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:16.440]  Val: Help me if you can hear me.
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:18.440]  Val: So, if you can stop me,
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:20.440]  Val: stop me, stop me.
[03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:22.440]  Val: We do it with light speakers.
[03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:24.440]  Val: We have it.
[03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:26.440]  Val: We get it.
[03:15:26.440 --> 03:15:28.440]  Val: It's like it becomes instinctive.
[03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:30.440]  Val: My dad would stop me.
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:32.440]  Val: He's the one.
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:34.440]  Val: You guys never
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:36.440]  Val: trust your feelings.
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:38.440]  Val: Always trust your instincts.
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:40.440]  Val: Your emotions.
[03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:42.440]  Val: And there's a huge difference between
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:44.440]  Val: your feelings and your emotions
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:46.440]  Val: and your instincts.
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:16:00.440]  Fed: What are you talking about?
[03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:02.440]  Fed: Feelings versus questions.
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:04.440]  Fed: Your instinct, I guess.
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:06.440]  Val: Your instinct is my emotion.
[03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:08.440]  Val: Your instinct is my reply.
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:10.440]  Val: It's like this danger is not in me.
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:12.440]  Val: This is going to serve me, not serve me.
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:14.440]  Val: I'm going to have to calculate it.
[03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:16.440]  Val: That's the risk.
[03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:18.440]  Val: I'm going to do the risk.
[03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:20.440]  Val: Let's see how sad it's going to be.
[03:16:20.440 --> 03:16:22.440]  Val: That's a [unintelligible].
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:24.440]  Val: Our brains are so fucking
[03:16:24.440 --> 03:16:26.440]  Val: amazingly fast.
[03:16:26.440 --> 03:16:28.440]  Val: We calculate that.
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:30.440]  Val: And it comes out as an instinctive
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:32.440]  Val: instinctive man. [??]
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:34.440]  Val: The emotional of the cloud,
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:36.440]  Val: you can see everything through this wall
[03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:38.440]  Val: that you're not wanted or not loved
[03:16:38.440 --> 03:16:40.440]  Val: or you're not wanted or not loved.
[03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:42.440]  Val: That's the way you're going to friend the world. [??]
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:44.440]  Val: That's the emotion you want to love. [??]
[03:16:44.440 --> 03:16:46.440]  Val: So focus on the world. [??]
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:48.440]  Val: That's all they want. [??]
[03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:50.440]  Val: You can do that.
[03:16:50.440 --> 03:16:52.440]  Val: Your dad just died.
[03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:54.440]  Val: My dad and my mother.
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:56.440]  Val: It was terrible.
[03:16:56.440 --> 03:16:58.440]  Val: I used to be
[03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:00.440]  Val: like a...
[03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:02.440]  Val: [laundry??].
[03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:04.440]  Val: I didn't do that.
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:06.440]  Val: I didn't do shopping.
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:08.440]  Val: People did it for me.
[03:17:08.440 --> 03:17:10.440]  Val: All of a sudden, I'm living in my car.
[03:17:10.440 --> 03:17:12.440]  Val: I don't know how to do it.
[03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:14.440]  Val: I don't know how to...
[03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:16.440]  Val: I didn't think I had it in me.
[03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:18.440]  Val: They did.
[03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:20.440]  Val: I don't know. We'll see.
[03:17:20.440 --> 03:17:22.440]  Val: We'll see.
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:24.440]  Val: It's another thing I'm not going to go there.
[03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:28.440]  Fed: It's a party.
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:34.440]  Fed: Hello.
[03:17:34.440 --> 03:17:36.440]  Fed: How are you?
[03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:38.440]  Fed: I'm fine.
[03:17:38.440 --> 03:17:40.440]  Fed: It's been a few years.
[03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:42.440]  Did you sacrifice?
[03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:44.440]  No.
[03:17:44.440 --> 03:17:46.440]  Fed: It's been a few years.
[unintelligible background talk]
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:10.440]  Fed: We'll do some research.
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:12.440]  Fed: Developing drugs.
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:14.440]  Fed: Like...
[03:18:14.440 --> 03:18:16.440]  Fed: We'll see.
[unintelligible background talk]
[03:18:18.440 --> 03:18:20.440]  Fed: I didn't do it.
[03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:54.440]  Fed: There's been a handful.
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:56.440]  Fed: Yeah, there's been a handful.
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:18:58.440]  Fed: We have the FBI tries to hire
[03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:00.440]  Fed: diversely
[03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:02.440]  Fed: in terms of like backgrounds.
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:04.440]  Fed: So we don't...
[03:19:04.440 --> 03:19:06.440]  Fed: We try
[03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:08.440]  Fed: There's a big pool of like...
[03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:10.440]  Fed: Lawyers want to join...
[03:19:10.440 --> 03:19:12.440]  Fed: Cops want to join...
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:14.440]  Fed: [unintelligible] want to be in contact with...
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:16.440]  Fed: want to join...
[03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:18.440]  The military.
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:20.440]  Fed: We certainly don't want to be a
[03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:22.440]  Fed: 100% of that.
[03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:24.440]  Fed: We don't want to be a general...
[03:19:24.440 --> 03:19:26.440]  Fed: We want to be a general population.
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:28.440]  Fed: We don't want...
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:30.440]  Fed: We're going to get a fifth grade teacher
[03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:32.440]  Fed: when I was in high school.
[03:19:32.440 --> 03:19:34.440]  Fed: He also had a rocket scientist.
[03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:36.440]  Fed: Just a lot of people.
[03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:38.440]  Fed: I've had all over the world.
[03:19:38.440 --> 03:19:40.440]  Fed: What was a fifth grade teacher.
[03:19:40.440 --> 03:19:42.440]  Fed: They've heard of people together?
[03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:44.440]  Fed: She's actually a good...
[03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:46.440]  Fed: She's still a good agent.
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:48.440]  Val: She must be a people person.
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:50.440]  Fed: Yeah, she's very good people.
[03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:52.440]  Fed: But she's also a very good...
[03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:54.720]  Fed: and a lot of things that we had to do.
[03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:55.720]  Fed: But...
[03:19:55.720 --> 03:19:57.280]  Val: You still have the Casanovas?
[03:19:57.280 --> 03:19:58.480]  Val: And it still exists?
[03:19:58.480 --> 03:19:59.480]  Val: Casanovas?
[03:19:59.480 --> 03:20:00.480]  Val: Spies?
[03:20:00.480 --> 03:20:01.480]  Fed: What's that?
[03:20:01.480 --> 03:20:02.480]  Val: Casanovas.
[03:20:02.480 --> 03:20:03.480]  Val: Spies.
[03:20:03.480 --> 03:20:06.480]  Fed: Yeah, well, we don't know a lot like that.
[03:20:06.480 --> 03:20:07.480]  Fed: It's a little thing.
[03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:09.480]  Val: No, it's like the old 60s.
[03:20:09.480 --> 03:20:12.480]  Val: You know, the guys who got laid to get information.
[03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:13.480]  Fed: Hello.
[03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:15.480]  Fed: I don't think that's ever been
[03:20:15.480 --> 03:20:16.480]  Fed: No, I don't.
[03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:18.480]  Fed: Maybe it's what's waiting for my time.
[03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:19.480]  Fed: That's the 60s.
[03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:21.480]  Fed: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the...
[03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:23.520]  Fed: You know, that's the limit.
[03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:25.520]  Fed: They're working for us right now.
[03:20:25.520 --> 03:20:27.520]  Fed: Those guys get fired.
[03:20:27.520 --> 03:20:29.520]  Fed: I was gonna say.
[03:20:29.520 --> 03:20:31.520]  Fed: Do you know how many roles we have?
[03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:34.520]  Fed: Like, half the stories of your complete bullshit.
[03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:37.520]  Fed: But, you know, it's good that there's a myth out there
[03:20:37.520 --> 03:20:40.520]  Fed: that people make you just sleep with whoever.
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:42.520]  Fed: Maybe that's...I'm sure that's what some agents said.
[03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:43.520]  Fed: It's like, no, no, no.
[03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:45.520]  Fed: I'm recruiting you for some super secret mission.
[03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:47.520]  Fed: All you gotta do is sleep with me.
[03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:48.520]  Val: Right.
[03:20:48.560 --> 03:20:50.560]  Fed: You know, she's probably graduating.
[03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:52.560]  Fed: It's like, I'm working for the FBI.
[03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:54.560]  Fed: That's what I'm doing.
[03:20:54.560 --> 03:20:56.560]  Val: Oh, quick question, though.
[03:20:56.560 --> 03:21:00.560]  Val: You guys have unfettered access to, like,
[03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:05.560]  Val: the sort of the interagency software
[03:21:05.560 --> 03:21:08.560]  Val: where, like, if I wanted to go hack into your phone,
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:12.560]  Val: to your camera.
[03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:14.560]  Val: Is there FISA warrant?
[03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:16.560]  Val: Still, there's not a FISA warrant?
[03:21:16.600 --> 03:21:19.600]  Val: Do you have to be able to probable cause?
[03:21:19.600 --> 03:21:23.600]  Val: Like, if I wanted to hack into your phone
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:27.600]  Val: and try your camera, would I need a FISA warrant?
[03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:28.600]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:31.600]  Val: Or is it, like, is it sure like now?
[03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:32.600]  Val: Is it in the world?
[03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:34.600]  Val: See, ten years ago, if you needed a FISA warrant,
[03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:35.600]  Val: it would be very qualified to get one.
[03:21:35.600 --> 03:21:38.600]  Val: But now it's adjacent to the point where you just ask for it.
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:39.600]  Fed: No, it's way harder.
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:40.600]  Val: Really?
[03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:41.600]  Fed: Should that, even that?
[03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:44.600]  Fed: And just thinking theoretically is, like,
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:45.640]  Fed: even harder to do.
[03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:46.640]  Val: Really?
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:48.640]  Fed: Yeah, to an effect.
[03:21:48.640 --> 03:21:51.640]  Fed: You're not, you're no longer searching, you're actively
[03:21:51.640 --> 03:21:53.640]  Fed: buttering or flipping.
[03:21:53.640 --> 03:21:55.640]  Fed: That's what happens.
[03:21:55.640 --> 03:21:58.640]  Fed: Yeah, then that, like, a new turn.
[03:21:58.640 --> 03:22:00.640]  Fed: Like, a turn on the camera.
[03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:02.640]  Val: What's the difference now in a guy sitting in a car
[03:22:02.640 --> 03:22:04.640]  Val: on top of a car?
[03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:07.640]  Fed: Look, this thing can go places where some guy in a car can't.
[03:22:07.640 --> 03:22:08.640]  Val: Which is...
[03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:09.640]  Fed: In a car?
[03:22:09.640 --> 03:22:10.640]  Fed: In a car.
[03:22:10.640 --> 03:22:11.640]  Val: In a car in your house.
[03:22:11.640 --> 03:22:13.640]  Val: Who's a guy in a car?
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:15.680]  Val: Yeah, I thought it was you guys.
[03:22:15.680 --> 03:22:16.680]  Val: See you guys?
[03:22:16.680 --> 03:22:18.680]  Fed: We're in the triangle.
[03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:20.680]  Fed: I don't think so.
[03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:22.680]  Val: There's some other interesting things to see.
[03:22:22.680 --> 03:22:25.680]  Val: You got a guy outside of the brewery.
[03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:28.680]  Val: So he's in the same place with the triangle.
[03:22:28.680 --> 03:22:31.680]  Val: And then every time he spots, he goes away
[03:22:31.680 --> 03:22:33.680]  Val: I thought it was you.
[03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:35.680]  Fed: Might be, like, see a higher-department investigator
[03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:37.680]  Fed: for all I know.
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:38.680]  Val: Maybe that, too.
[03:22:38.680 --> 03:22:40.680]  Val: Let's take a picture of the place.
[03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:42.680]  Val: Can I just run it here?
[03:22:42.720 --> 03:22:43.720]  Fed: How would you run it?
[03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:45.720]  Val: Oh, I got some.
[03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:47.720]  Fed: You got a guy.
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:49.720]  Val: That's the thing.
[03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:51.720]  Fed: I got a guy.
[03:22:51.720 --> 03:22:53.720]  Val: You used to be seen in the improviser
[03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:55.720]  Val: and you guys know how to do it.
[03:22:55.720 --> 03:22:57.720]  Fed: Oh, I know.
[03:22:57.720 --> 03:22:59.720]  Fed: That is...
[03:22:59.720 --> 03:23:01.720]  Val: How do you put that?
[03:23:01.720 --> 03:23:02.720]  Fed: Stuff.
[03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:04.720]  Fed: I mean, you can't do it by yourself.
[03:23:04.720 --> 03:23:06.720]  Fed: The level of this is not as much as it needs to be
[03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:09.720]  Fed: to roll with the times and adapt.
[03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:11.760]  Fed: Like, for example,
[03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:14.760]  Fed: this whole encryption key battle,
[03:23:14.760 --> 03:23:18.760]  Fed: like, you know, we've had previous leaders talk about,
[03:23:18.760 --> 03:23:21.760]  Fed: like, what do you need to give up the encryption key?
[03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:23.760]  Fed: But we all kind of know, like,
[03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.760]  Fed: philosophically, that'll never,
[03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:27.760]  Fed: and that shouldn't happen if it doesn't matter.
[03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:29.760]  Fed: It's, like, a losing battle.
[03:23:29.760 --> 03:23:31.760]  Fed: We're just going to, unfortunately, have to adapt.
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:34.760]  Fed: If you just build a job, it's just going to be harder.
[03:23:34.760 --> 03:23:37.760]  Fed: And then many, you know, like,
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:41.800]  Fed: these old-school techniques
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:43.800]  Fed: that, like, talking to people, like,
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:45.800]  Fed: we're talking right now are talking to people
[03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:47.800]  Fed: that are now way more, you know,
[03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:49.800]  Fed: just sitting at your desk
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:51.800]  Fed: and looking at, like, a pipeline.
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:54.800]  Fed: So it becomes, there's a question [???]
[03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:56.800]  Fed: at work sometimes.
[03:23:56.800 --> 03:23:58.800]  Fed: And, like, swaying back to [??]
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:01.800]  Fed: And this is just me, but it should be hard.
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:03.800]  Val: It should be hard?
[03:24:03.800 --> 03:24:05.800]  Fed: It should be hard.
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:07.840]  Fed: It should be hard.
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:09.840]  Val: I agree a lot.
[03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:11.840]  Val: It should be better.
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:13.840]  Val: It's not the way it works.
[03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:15.840]  Val: It's the way it works.
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:17.840]  Val: There's nothing, there's no secret to it.
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:19.840]  Val: It's just that, you know,
[03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:21.840]  Val: I can find it when I want it,
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:23.840]  Val: but I don't really want it yet.
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:25.840]  Val: There's nothing I can do.
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:27.840]  Val: You can do that.
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:29.840]  Val: You know, I mean, I can do it.
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:31.840]  Val: I can do it anywhere in the world.
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:33.840]  Val: You know, once you get there,
[03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:35.880]  Val: you have to actually keep a secret from all of them.
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:37.880]  Val: That's a weird quote.
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:39.880]  Val: I don't know what to make of it.
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:41.880]  Val: You just have to adapt to it and accept it, I guess.
[03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:43.880]  Val: It's true.
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:45.880]  Val: It's just, like, you know,
[03:24:45.880 --> 03:24:47.880]  Val: good pre-LLCs instead of work.
[03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:51.880]  Val: You don't have your name on it.
[03:24:51.880 --> 03:24:53.880]  Val: That's beautiful things.
[03:24:53.880 --> 03:24:55.880]  Val: That's why it's a living dog.
[03:24:55.880 --> 03:24:57.880]  Val: You can have a fake name.
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:24:59.880]  Val: You can have a name.
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:01.880]  Val: Perfectly legal to be in charge of an LLC.
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:03.920]  Val: It's a good thing to do.
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:05.920]  Val: Jersey and all of Iowa.
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:07.920]  Fed: Yeah, it's just like a state.
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:09.920]  Fed: It's a state.
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:11.920]  Fed: You know what?
[03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:13.920]  Val: It's very deep, very Jersey.
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:15.920]  Val: I think that's pretty sure.
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:17.920]  Fed: Probably.
[03:25:17.920 --> 03:25:19.920]  Fed: It's a good spot.
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:25.920]  Val: Thank you.
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:27.920]  Fed: You want to go?
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:29.920]  Fed: I'll go.
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:31.960]  Fed: I'm trying to be helpful.
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:33.960]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:37.960]  Val: Actually, I think if you prefer
[03:25:37.960 --> 03:25:39.960]  Val: an opera or a movie,
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:41.960]  Val: I think you can take it.
[03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:43.960]  Val: I think you can take it.
[unintelligible chatting]
[03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:33.960]  Val: It's not, I can't, it's, it's all I'm learning.
[03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:35.960]  Val: It's not only me.
[03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:37.960]  Val: It's only freedom, too.
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:39.960]  Val: It's a freedom, you know what I'm saying?
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:42.960]  Val: It's worrying about a kid, and then everything is justified.
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:45.960]  Val: Everything is justified if it's for his safety.
[03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:47.960]  Val: You know?
[03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:50.960]  Val: That's the interesting part of it.
[03:26:50.960 --> 03:26:53.960]  Val: Where are you thinking about yourself all the time?
[03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:55.960]  Val: I don't know.
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:26:58.960]  Val: I think it's more because of the protector.
[03:26:58.960 --> 03:27:02.960]  Val: Yeah, or, uh, or...
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:04.960]  Val: I don't know.
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:06.960]  Val: There's a word for it.
[03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:08.960]  Val: You're a protector of someone.
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:10.960]  Val: Someone else's life is now.
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:12.960]  Fed:Yeah.
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:14.960]  Val: Well, it's also pretty scary as shit.
[03:27:14.960 --> 03:27:17.960]  Val: You know, you're accountable for everything.
[03:27:18.960 --> 03:27:21.960]  Val: What if it turns out to be an accident?
[03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:23.960]  Val: Shit.
[03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:25.960]  Fed: That's when you were like, that was the other person.
[03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:27.960]  Val: Shit.
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:31.960]  Fed: Yeah, you're gonna have faith, though.
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:33.960]  Fed: That's all for me.
[03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:35.960]  Fed: Here you go.
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:42.960]  Fed: Are you serious?
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:44.960]  Fed: He's just searing in the sun.
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:46.960]  Val: Well, Houston is hot, right?
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:48.960]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:55.960]  Val: There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
[03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:57.960]  Fed: What's that?
[03:27:57.960 --> 03:27:59.960]  Val: There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
[03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:01.960]  Val: And a trade-off and a trade-off.
[03:28:01.960 --> 03:28:03.960]  Val: It's really big.
[03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:05.960]  Val: The whole concept of oil contracts is really big.
[03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:07.960]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:09.960]  Fed: The oil companies are very political.
[03:28:09.960 --> 03:28:12.960]  Fed: There's a lot of other factors that you can think of.
[03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:14.960]  Val: Yeah?
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:16.960]  Val: Just political factors?
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:18.960]  Val: People that are just fucking...
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:20.960]  Val: I think everyone else is off.
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:22.960]  Fed: Well, I think there's a lot of other things.
[03:28:22.960 --> 03:28:24.960]  Fed: Peaks down around the whole...
[03:28:24.960 --> 03:28:26.960]  Fed: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:28.960]  Fed: I don't know.
[03:28:28.960 --> 03:28:30.960]  Fed: People have issues with oil contracts.
[unintelligible]
Fed: That's why we're gainfully employed
[unintelligible talk about bitcoin]
[03:31:41.460 --> 03:31:42.460]  Fed: Now it's 11.5.
[03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:43.460]  Fed: 11.5?
[03:31:43.460 --> 03:31:44.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:31:44.460 --> 03:31:45.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:31:45.460 --> 03:31:46.460]  Fed: I'm sorry.
[03:31:46.460 --> 03:31:47.460]  Fed: I'm sorry.
[03:31:47.460 --> 03:31:48.460]  Fed: It dropped to...
[03:31:48.460 --> 03:31:49.460]  Fed: It went up to 12,000.
[03:31:49.460 --> 03:31:50.460]  Fed: It dropped to...
[03:31:50.460 --> 03:31:51.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:31:51.460 --> 03:31:52.460]  Fed: 4,000.
[03:31:52.460 --> 03:31:55.460]  Fed: At least then I could regulate it.
[03:31:55.460 --> 03:31:56.460]  Fed: Do you like it?
[03:31:57.460 --> 03:31:59.460]  Val: Well, yeah, I don't like it.
[03:31:59.460 --> 03:32:02.460]  Val: I just like to talk to you regularly.
[03:32:02.460 --> 03:32:07.460]  Val: Yeah, I still haven't tried it, you know.
[03:32:07.460 --> 03:32:11.460]  Val: I didn't expect you to do this, but you did.
[03:32:11.460 --> 03:32:16.460]  Val: You didn't have to decide what you wanted to try.
[03:32:16.460 --> 03:32:17.460]  Val: You just didn't know.
[03:32:17.460 --> 03:32:24.460]  Val: You didn't even know how to do it.
[03:32:24.460 --> 03:32:25.460]  Val: You just flashed in there.
[03:32:25.460 --> 03:32:27.460]  Val: You could be just pump and dump.
[03:32:27.460 --> 03:32:28.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:32:28.460 --> 03:32:33.460]  Val: I didn't want to say too much.
[03:32:33.460 --> 03:32:37.460]  Fed: The whole Brickel-Prinsky arena.
[unintelligible]
3:33:39 Val: And then somebody did get into my computer when we left for dinner or something, and they pulled out all my log files. Very strange.
Fed: Deleted them or..?
Val: No, just copied them.
Fed: How did you, how did you figure that out?
[03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:52.460]  Fed: How did you figure that out?
[03:33:52.460 --> 03:33:56.460]  Val: I just put the time last time I logged in.
[03:33:56.460 --> 03:33:58.460]  Val: I didn't log in. I wasn't going to log in.
[03:33:58.460 --> 03:34:00.460]  Val: What the fuck? I didn't log in the moment.
[03:34:00.460 --> 03:34:02.460]  Val: And what would they go for?
[03:34:02.460 --> 03:34:04.460]  Val: And then I took the last window.
[03:34:04.460 --> 03:34:06.460]  Val: They didn't leave the window open.
[03:34:06.460 --> 03:34:08.460]  Val: I think I just sort of assumed it was a log file
[03:34:08.460 --> 03:34:10.460]  Val: because the windows were open.
[03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:12.460]  Val: But I actually don't really know what they took.
[03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:14.460]  Val: I still think it could be Glenn.
[03:34:14.460 --> 03:34:16.460]  Val: Glenn thought I was spy.
[03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:22.460]  Val: Glenn was a funny story.
[03:34:22.460 --> 03:34:24.460]  Val: So after the Bahamas,
[03:34:24.460 --> 03:34:26.460]  Val: he flies me back to his house.
[03:34:26.460 --> 03:34:28.460]  Val: At first I thought I was staying at a hotel.
[03:34:28.460 --> 03:34:30.460]  Val: He said, go to his house.
[03:34:30.460 --> 03:34:32.460]  Val: And it turns out I was at his house.
[03:34:32.460 --> 03:34:34.460]  Val: Why am I staying here?
[03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:36.460]  Val: It's too hot right now in Florida.
[03:34:36.460 --> 03:34:38.460]  Val: And it's too hot in DC.
[03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:40.460]  Val: You can't put your hotel in.
[03:34:40.460 --> 03:34:42.460]  Val: You've got to stay here.
[03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:44.460]  Val: Fortunately, my wife is gone on a vacation.
[03:34:44.460 --> 03:34:46.460]  Val: But you can stay in her room.
[03:34:46.460 --> 03:34:48.460]  Val: Her room.
[03:34:48.460 --> 03:34:50.460]  Val: They haven't slept in the same rooms
[03:34:50.460 --> 03:34:52.460]  Val: for like ten years.
[03:34:52.460 --> 03:34:54.460]  Val: So they're separated by the same house.
[03:34:54.460 --> 03:34:56.460]  Val: Okay, so I stayed in his room.
[03:34:56.460 --> 03:34:58.460]  Val: I was asleep.
[03:34:58.460 --> 03:35:00.460]  Val: I was so tired and I had some long flight.
[03:35:00.460 --> 03:35:02.460]  Val: And then I wake up.
[03:35:02.460 --> 03:35:04.460]  Val: And you know,
[03:35:04.460 --> 03:35:06.460]  Val: Go outside for a cigarette.
[03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:08.460]  Val: He has this colonial house with this kitchen porch.
[03:35:08.460 --> 03:35:10.460]  Val: And I notice there's like a brick
[03:35:10.460 --> 03:35:12.460]  Val: in the screen window.
[03:35:12.460 --> 03:35:14.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:35:14.460 --> 03:35:16.460]  Val: I sat there the last night.
[03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:18.460]  Val: I didn't call it a good story.
[03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:20.460]  Val: What were you doing at 2am last night?
[03:35:20.460 --> 03:35:22.460]  Val: I was asleep.
[03:35:22.460 --> 03:35:24.460]  Val: In bed.
[03:35:24.460 --> 03:35:26.460]  Val: No, you weren't.
[03:35:26.460 --> 03:35:28.460]  Val: I heard a car.
[03:35:28.460 --> 03:35:30.460]  Val: I saw you run to the car.
[03:35:30.460 --> 03:35:32.460]  Val: They gave him something.
[03:35:32.460 --> 03:35:34.460]  Val: What did you give him?
[03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:36.460]  Val: I didn't give him anything.
[03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:38.460]  Val: I have it all in video.
[03:35:38.460 --> 03:35:40.460]  Val: And it is this huge 1997 camera
[03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:42.460]  Val: that you know,
[03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:44.460]  Val: he has not updated its RAM systems.
[03:35:44.460 --> 03:35:46.460]  Fed: Made by Nintendo.
[03:35:46.460 --> 03:35:48.460]  Val: Nintendo, yeah.
[03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:50.460]  Val: And so he starts going through his,
[03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:52.460]  Val: you know, his fast-forward
[03:35:52.460 --> 03:35:54.460]  Val: thing in his office.
[03:35:54.460 --> 03:35:56.460]  Val: He takes me to the office.
[03:35:56.460 --> 03:35:58.460]  Val: He's like, he's so
[03:35:58.460 --> 03:36:00.460]  Val: convinced that he's caught a Russian spy
[03:36:00.460 --> 03:36:02.460]  Val: in his house trying to get out of there.
[03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:04.460]  Val: Dossier just was published.
[03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:06.460]  Val: He's like,
[03:36:06.460 --> 03:36:08.460]  Val: he's out.
[03:36:08.460 --> 03:36:10.460]  Val: And then,
[03:36:10.460 --> 03:36:12.460]  Val: around 2am,
[03:36:12.460 --> 03:36:14.460]  Val: we see a hundred shadowy figure
[03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:16.460]  Val: approach.
[03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:18.460]  Fed: Wow.
[03:36:18.460 --> 03:36:20.460]  Val: And I see it.
[03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:22.460]  Val: And I see the figures sort of stumble and fall.
[03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:24.460]  Val: And they stand up really quick.
[03:36:24.460 --> 03:36:26.460]  Val: And I look around and see the camera.
[03:36:26.460 --> 03:36:28.460]  Val: Glenn's nine[??] year old kid.
[03:36:28.460 --> 03:36:30.460]  Val: He's strong, he's strong.
[03:36:30.460 --> 03:36:32.460]  Val: And you can't get into.
[03:36:32.460 --> 03:36:34.460]  Val: He's trying to slice the window screen.
[03:36:34.460 --> 03:36:36.460]  Val: The only window that doesn't have an alarm
[03:36:36.460 --> 03:36:38.460]  Val: is the [unintelligible] window
Fed: [unintelligible question]
[03:36:38.460 --> 03:36:40.460]  Val: No, no, Glenn Simpson.
[03:36:40.460 --> 03:36:42.460]  Val: He's going to be a Russian spy
[03:36:42.460 --> 03:36:44.460]  Val: when his son tries to sneak back in
[03:36:44.460 --> 03:36:46.460]  Val: for a party.
[03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.460]  Val: Still no apology.
[03:36:48.460 --> 03:36:50.460]  Fed: You guys.
[03:36:52.460 --> 03:36:54.460]  Fed: I appreciate that.
[03:36:54.460 --> 03:36:56.460]  Fed: Well, anything else
[03:36:56.460 --> 03:36:58.460]  Fed: that you think you might be able to help out with
[03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:00.460]  Fed: is what I'm going to do is I've written down
[03:37:00.460 --> 03:37:02.460]  Fed: a list of the stuff that
[03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:04.460]  Fed: we see you have Access To.
[03:37:04.460 --> 03:37:06.460]  Fed: And most look like
[03:37:06.460 --> 03:37:08.460]  Fed: financial project stuff
[03:37:08.460 --> 03:37:10.460]  Fed: which would be useful for someone.
[03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:12.460]  Fed: I don't know.
[03:37:12.460 --> 03:37:14.460]  Val: I can do
[03:37:14.460 --> 03:37:16.460]  Val: emails.
[03:37:16.460 --> 03:37:18.460]  Val: Those are pretty easy.
[03:37:18.460 --> 03:37:20.460]  Val: Again, social engineering
[03:37:20.460 --> 03:37:22.460]  Val: I'm pretty good at.
[03:37:22.460 --> 03:37:24.460]  Val: When I get in that zone
[03:37:24.460 --> 03:37:26.460]  Val: and turn on the charm,
[03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:28.460]  Val: I can do fun,
[03:37:28.460 --> 03:37:30.460]  Val: actually enjoy it sometimes.
[03:37:30.460 --> 03:37:32.460]  Val: Actually, that would be fun.
[03:37:32.460 --> 03:37:34.460]  Val: If you need...
[03:37:34.460 --> 03:37:36.460]  Val: I've been focusing
[03:37:36.460 --> 03:37:38.460]  Val: just as like any concerned citizen, I think
[03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:40.460]  Val: but you guys are FBI
[03:37:40.460 --> 03:37:42.460]  Val: so you don't have to answer the question.
[03:37:42.460 --> 03:37:44.460]  Val: I'm sort of Trump-based.
[03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:46.460]  Val: People come to me
[03:37:46.460 --> 03:37:48.460]  Val: with a lot of financial documents
[03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:50.460]  Val: from all over the world.
[03:37:50.460 --> 03:37:52.460]  Val: A lot of them are just...
[03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:54.460]  Val: There's a lot of hoops.
[03:37:54.460 --> 03:37:56.460]  Val: Some people like Ed from Ireland
[03:37:56.460 --> 03:37:58.460]  Val: is a legit guy.
[03:37:58.460 --> 03:38:00.460]  Val: The Catrice Jose guy
[03:38:00.460 --> 03:38:02.460]  Val: is some sort of state-run guy.
[03:38:02.460 --> 03:38:04.460]  Val: I don't know.
[03:38:04.460 --> 03:38:06.460]  Val: But I get a lot of that.
[03:38:06.460 --> 03:38:08.460]  Val: And then
[03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:10.460]  Val: there's
[03:38:10.460 --> 03:38:12.460]  Val: the Epstein thing with the sort of
[03:38:12.460 --> 03:38:14.460]  Val: a side gig for New York Times.
[03:38:14.460 --> 03:38:16.460]  Val: But I can
[03:38:16.460 --> 03:38:18.460]  Val: get that data,
[03:38:18.460 --> 03:38:20.460]  Val: but I did not want to take the step
[03:38:20.460 --> 03:38:22.460]  Val: to break in.
[03:38:22.460 --> 03:38:24.460]  Val: If you need me to do that, I'm happy to break in.
[03:38:24.460 --> 03:38:26.460]  Val: And if it's legal, and you guys are like
[03:38:26.460 --> 03:38:28.460]  Val: do legally, let's say
[03:38:28.460 --> 03:38:30.460]  Val: you can do this, I'm like OK
[03:38:30.460 --> 03:38:32.460]  Val: Good I'm happy to do that
[03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:34.460]  Fed: And it would definitely be something
[03:38:34.460 --> 03:38:36.460]  Fed: we would tell you to do with a bunch of other caveats
[03:38:36.460 --> 03:38:38.460]  Fed: and would not be allowed to do.
[03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:40.460]  Fed: But...
[03:38:40.460 --> 03:38:42.460]  Fed: Let's see.
[03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:44.460]  Fed: Let me know if I missed anything too,
[03:38:44.460 --> 03:38:46.460]  Fed: because I have
[03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:48.460]  Fed: Tyler Rossi about MPS.
[03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:50.460]  Fed: You did a man-in-the-middle for
[03:38:50.460 --> 03:38:52.460]  Fed: mom's computer.
[03:38:52.460 --> 03:38:54.460]  Fed: You hacked Deutcshe Bank, but not really.
[03:38:54.460 --> 03:38:56.460]  Val: Right.
[03:38:56.460 --> 03:38:58.460]  Val: I still can, though.
[03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:00.460]  Val: I dony't know
[03:39:00.460 --> 03:39:02.460]  Val: should I or I don't know.
[03:39:02.460 --> 03:39:04.460]  Fed: If you ask me, you should not do any illegal activity.
[03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:06.460]  Fed: That's probably the best
[03:39:06.460 --> 03:39:08.460]  Fed: course of action.
[03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:10.460]  Val: No, I'm not going to know that for sure.
[03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:12.460]  Val: I'm not going to talk about that.
[03:39:12.460 --> 03:39:14.460]  Val: But hacking a bank
[03:39:14.460 --> 03:39:16.460]  Val: is just hacking the bankers.
[03:39:16.460 --> 03:39:18.460]  Fed: That's true. That's illegal.
[03:39:18.460 --> 03:39:20.460]  Fed: I wouldn't suggest it.
[03:39:20.460 --> 03:39:22.460]  Val: No, but I mean, in a case,
[03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:24.460]  Val: it would be something that you would want.
[03:39:24.460 --> 03:39:26.460]  Val: But can you really hack people like that?
[03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:28.460]  Fed: It's not something
[03:39:28.460 --> 03:39:30.460]  Fed: that we would normally do.
[03:39:30.460 --> 03:39:32.460]  Fed: So, like,
[03:39:32.460 --> 03:39:34.460]  Fed: it's good to know you have the skills, because we could
[03:39:34.460 --> 03:39:36.460]  Fed: put you in a situation where you can talk to other people,
[03:39:36.460 --> 03:39:38.460]  Fed: or we can introduce you to a group,
[03:39:38.460 --> 03:39:40.460]  Fed: or do something else, y'know, more complicated.
[03:39:40.460 --> 03:39:42.460]  Fed: But knowing your skills is a good thing to do.
[03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:44.460]  Fed: But it would be rare where I'd be like,
[03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:46.460]  Fed: hey, go hacking a Deutsche Bank,
[03:39:46.460 --> 03:39:48.460]  Fed: steal their stuff for me,
[03:39:48.460 --> 03:39:50.460]  Fed: because in court, that would be a hell of a thing
[03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:52.460]  Fed: to show that the
[03:39:52.460 --> 03:39:54.460]  Fed: government essentially hacked into a bank to deal with that.
[03:39:54.460 --> 03:39:56.460]  Val: Well, I know, but there's also
[03:39:56.460 --> 03:39:58.460]  Val: you guys, I'm sure you have people like this
[03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:00.460]  Val: in your agency, where other
[03:40:00.460 --> 03:40:02.460]  Val: agencies have the same types, where you find
[03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:04.460]  Val: an outside person like myself,
[03:40:04.460 --> 03:40:06.460]  Val: that you hire basically
[03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:08.460]  Val: to break the rules, but you don't say to break the rules.
[03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:10.460]  Val: You need someone that, you don't do that?
[03:40:10.460 --> 03:40:12.460]  Val: No? Okay.
[03:40:12.460 --> 03:40:14.460]  Fed: Definitely not.
[03:40:14.460 --> 03:40:16.460]  Fed: I would tell you this, the rule is
[03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:18.460]  Fed: if you were officially working with us,
[03:40:18.460 --> 03:40:20.460]  Fed: you are an extension of the government
[03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:22.460]  Fed: in the sense that if
[03:40:22.460 --> 03:40:24.460]  Fed: you can't do anything I can't do.
[03:40:24.460 --> 03:40:26.460]  Val: Like a self-contractor.
[03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:28.460]  Fed: Yeah, I guess you can kind of think about it like that.
[03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:30.460]  Fed: You're not employed by the government.
[03:40:30.460 --> 03:40:32.460]  Fed: But like, if I told you to
[03:40:32.460 --> 03:40:34.460]  Fed: hack into something, it'd be like me hacking into it.
[03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:36.460]  Fed: I can't do it, you can't do it.
[03:40:36.460 --> 03:40:38.460]  Val: Okay, so I'd represent,
[03:40:38.460 --> 03:40:40.460]  Val: who would you represent in the government?
[03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:41.460]  Val: Like, or...
[03:40:41.460 --> 03:40:42.460]  Fed: Indirectly, yeah.
[03:40:42.460 --> 03:40:44.460]  Fed: Like, you would give a...
[03:40:44.460 --> 03:40:46.460]  Fed: You would be getting the direction from the government, too, which I mean.
[03:40:46.460 --> 03:40:48.460]  Fed: It's like, there's an order
[03:40:48.460 --> 03:40:49.460]  Fed: or something.
[03:40:49.460 --> 03:40:51.460]  Fed: The action is from the government.
[03:40:51.460 --> 03:40:52.460]  Val: Right, right.
[03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:54.460]  Val: But technically, it's not, you're not,
[03:40:54.460 --> 03:40:55.460]  Val: it's not the government.
[03:40:55.460 --> 03:40:57.460]  Val: And who pays you is not the government either.
[03:40:57.460 --> 03:40:59.460]  Val: If you're an independent, who,
[03:40:59.460 --> 03:41:00.460]  Val: how do you pay it?
[03:41:00.460 --> 03:41:02.460]  Fed: You mean, if you were to
[03:41:02.460 --> 03:41:03.460]  Fed: be helping or something?
[03:41:03.460 --> 03:41:04.460]  Val: Sure.
[03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:06.460]  Fed: Yeah, that's the government.
[03:41:06.460 --> 03:41:08.460]  Val: Which actually comes from the government?
[03:41:08.460 --> 03:41:10.460]  Fed: No, [unintelligible]
[03:41:10.460 --> 03:41:11.460]  Val: Oh, okay.
[03:41:11.460 --> 03:41:12.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:41:12.460 --> 03:41:15.460]  Fed: But, we don't hire people to break the law.
[03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:17.460]  Fed: Like, to search [unintelligible]
[03:41:17.460 --> 03:41:18.460]  Val: Are there any...
[03:41:18.460 --> 03:41:19.460]  Fed: I'm sure they do.
[03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:21.460]  Fed: But that's Oklahoma's stuff.
[03:41:21.460 --> 03:41:23.460]  Fed: So, like, oversees the rules are different, right?
[03:41:23.460 --> 03:41:25.460]  Fed: Like, oversees your
[03:41:25.460 --> 03:41:27.460]  Fed: committing espionage, which is by the fact,
[03:41:27.460 --> 03:41:29.460]  Fed: you know, the fact that we're against the law, right?
[03:41:29.460 --> 03:41:30.460]  Val: Right.
[03:41:30.460 --> 03:41:31.460]  Fed: And the United States, you know,
[03:41:31.460 --> 03:41:33.460]  Fed: we're still bound by the Constitution.
[03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:35.460]  Fed: So, like, one distinction I want to make, too,
[03:41:35.460 --> 03:41:37.460]  Fed: is like, with the FBI, like,
[03:41:37.460 --> 03:41:39.460]  Fed: we will follow the rules every time.
[03:41:39.460 --> 03:41:41.460]  Fed: I'm never going to tell you to break the rule,
[03:41:41.460 --> 03:41:43.460]  Fed: and like, don't tell me about it or something.
[03:41:43.460 --> 03:41:44.460]  Val: We'll never deal with that situation.
[03:41:44.460 --> 03:41:45.460]  Val: Make a win-win.
[03:41:45.460 --> 03:41:46.460]  Fed: Never.
Val: That's good to know
[03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:48.460]  Fed: If I tell you something, like,
[03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:50.460]  Fed: even if I ask you to talk about something
[03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:52.460]  Fed: that could be construed as illegal,
[03:41:52.460 --> 03:41:54.460]  Fed: I'll have a whole document of, like,
[03:41:54.460 --> 03:41:56.460]  Fed: this is exactly what you're allowed to say,
[03:41:56.460 --> 03:41:57.460]  Fed: this is what you're not allowed to say,
[03:41:57.460 --> 03:41:59.460]  Fed: these are the communities[???],
[03:41:59.460 --> 03:42:01.460]  Fed: and you can't deviate from these four corners.
[03:42:01.460 --> 03:42:03.460]  Fed: Otherwise, we distance ourselves from you,
[03:42:03.460 --> 03:42:05.460]  Fed: because it's not what we ask.
[03:42:05.460 --> 03:42:06.460]  Val: Okay.
[03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:09.460]  Fed: So, because there's a lot of stuff about what the FBI is,
[03:42:09.460 --> 03:42:10.460]  Fed: or isn't
[03:42:10.460 --> 03:42:12.460]  Fed: Like, just from talking to you today, right?
[03:42:12.460 --> 03:42:14.460]  Fed: There's a lot of stuff that
[03:42:14.460 --> 03:42:15.460]  Fed: you've perceived to be as true
[03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:16.460]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:17.460]  Val: I totally learned a lot today.
[03:42:17.460 --> 03:42:18.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:42:18.460 --> 03:42:20.460]  Fed: So, that being said, it's like,
[03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:21.460]  Fed: if you work with us,
[03:42:21.460 --> 03:42:23.460]  Fed: it has to be very clear
[03:42:23.460 --> 03:42:25.460]  Fed: that you're not breaking any rules.
[03:42:25.460 --> 03:42:26.460]  Fed: Right?
[03:42:26.460 --> 03:42:28.460]  Fed: Because we also don't want to work with people
[03:42:28.460 --> 03:42:30.460]  Fed: who are not going to be able to follow directions.
[03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:32.460]  Fed: We talked about it, it makes sense to me,
[03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:34.460]  Fed: but, like, if you're going to give us information, too,
[03:42:34.460 --> 03:42:36.460]  Fed: we have to know that that is the whole fiction.
[03:42:36.460 --> 03:42:38.460]  Fed: You can't, like, take part of it.
[03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:40.460]  Fed: You can't omit the stuff
[03:42:40.460 --> 03:42:42.460]  Fed: that you don't want to tell us,
[03:42:42.460 --> 03:42:43.460]  Fed: what you tell us has to be everything.
[03:42:43.460 --> 03:42:45.460]  Fed: Because if we find out that it isn't everything,
[03:42:45.460 --> 03:42:46.460]  Fed: then we can't trust you, right?
[03:42:46.460 --> 03:42:47.460]  Val: Right, right.
[03:42:47.460 --> 03:42:48.460]  Val: So, you want me to hold back?
[03:42:48.460 --> 03:42:49.460]  Val: on like, Barrett.
[03:42:49.460 --> 03:42:52.460]  Val: If you ask me, tell me about Barrett.
[03:42:52.460 --> 03:42:53.460]  Val: So, that would be,
[03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:56.460]  Val: that would have to be what we have now.
[03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:58.460]  Val: So, we're not,
[03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:02.460]  Val: are we legally bound to tell you everything I know?
[03:43:02.460 --> 03:43:03.460]  Val: Not legally bound.
[03:43:03.460 --> 03:43:04.460]  Val: Here's the thing.
[03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:06.460]  Val: Can I make a mission based on what I think
[03:43:06.460 --> 03:43:08.460]  Val: is relevant and irrelevant?
[03:43:08.460 --> 03:43:09.460]  Val: Or no?
[03:43:09.460 --> 03:43:11.460]  Fed: It depends, right?
[03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:12.460]  Fed: I mean, like, here's the thing.
[03:43:12.460 --> 03:43:14.460]  Fed: You're not going to be your only source of information.
[03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:16.460]  Fed: That's not how to work either, right?
[03:43:16.460 --> 03:43:18.460]  Fed: I'm going to verify what you say.
[03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:19.460]  Fed: It's like I look at this stuff
[03:43:19.460 --> 03:43:20.460]  Fed: and I'll try to figure out it.
[03:43:20.460 --> 03:43:21.460]  Val: It's like a report.
[03:43:21.460 --> 03:43:22.460]  Val: Yeah, it's like a report, right?
[03:43:22.460 --> 03:43:24.460]  Fed: I mean, they're also investigators, so to speak.
[03:43:24.460 --> 03:43:26.460]  Fed: They publish their stuff.
[03:43:26.460 --> 03:43:29.460]  Fed: But, if you were to work with us, right?
[03:43:29.460 --> 03:43:32.460]  Fed: What I need from you most is trust.
[03:43:32.460 --> 03:43:34.460]  Fed: If I can't trust what you're saying,
[03:43:34.460 --> 03:43:36.460]  Fed: if I can't trust you with the information I give you,
[03:43:36.460 --> 03:43:38.460]  Fed: there's absolutely no reason we would work together.
[03:43:38.460 --> 03:43:39.460]  Fed: Right?
[03:43:39.460 --> 03:43:41.460]  Fed: Because if we were to involve you in something
[03:43:41.460 --> 03:43:43.460]  Fed: where you are involved with other criminals,
[03:43:43.460 --> 03:43:46.460]  Fed: you say, hey, by the way, I'm working with the FBI,
[03:43:46.460 --> 03:43:48.460]  Fed: that whole thing goes kaput
[03:43:48.460 --> 03:43:49.460]  Fed: Right?
[03:43:49.460 --> 03:43:50.460]  Fed: I mean, it doesn't help us.
[03:43:50.460 --> 03:43:53.460]  Fed: So that's why a lot of this stuff, too.
[03:43:53.460 --> 03:43:55.460]  Fed: If you're to give us information,
[03:43:55.460 --> 03:43:58.460]  Fed: it was partial information and it was omitted, right?
[03:43:58.460 --> 03:44:01.460]  Fed: There's a part in the court called discovery, right?
[03:44:01.460 --> 03:44:02.460]  Fed: I'm not sure how it works.
[03:44:02.460 --> 03:44:05.460]  Fed: So with Discovery, we have to provide everything to defend.
[03:44:05.460 --> 03:44:07.460]  Fed: That's how every U.S. government works, right?
[03:44:07.460 --> 03:44:10.460]  Fed: Everything that we have that we're using to prosecute this guy,
[03:44:10.460 --> 03:44:11.460]  Fed: the defense gets a copy of it.
[03:44:11.460 --> 03:44:13.460]  Fed: So they can cross-examine you on it, right?
[03:44:13.460 --> 03:44:14.460]  Val: Right.
[03:44:14.460 --> 03:44:16.460]  Val: So if anything illegal is happening and they... your case is screwed
[03:44:16.460 --> 03:44:20.460]  Fed: So in the case that if you gave us partial information,
[03:44:20.460 --> 03:44:22.460]  Fed: we'd provide that to the defense.
[03:44:22.460 --> 03:44:23.460]  Fed: The defense obviously knows the full story
[03:44:23.460 --> 03:44:25.460]  Fed: because they're the ones being charged.
[03:44:25.460 --> 03:44:27.460]  Fed: They say, actually, I said a bunch of stuff
[03:44:27.460 --> 03:44:28.460]  Fed: that is exculpatory.
[03:44:28.460 --> 03:44:30.460]  Fed: In other words, stuff that shows that I was innocent,
[03:44:30.460 --> 03:44:32.460]  Fed: but it was selectively filtered out.
[03:44:32.460 --> 03:44:34.460]  Fed: Our whole case would go to shit.
[03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:36.460]  Val: [???]
[03:44:36.460 --> 03:44:37.460]  Fed: Exactly, right.
[03:44:37.460 --> 03:44:40.460]  Fed: So just how it's not fair for Prasada to do that to you, right?
[03:44:40.460 --> 03:44:41.460]  Val: Right.
[03:44:41.460 --> 03:44:45.460]  Fed: So as the U.S. government, because we are the U.S. government,
[03:44:45.460 --> 03:44:48.460]  Fed: we play exactly by the rules, every time.
[03:44:48.460 --> 03:44:50.460]  Val: So is there a guy, a middle manager there, at some point,
[03:44:50.460 --> 03:44:54.460]  Val: that says, I decide what goes into this reporting
[03:44:54.460 --> 03:44:55.460]  Val: and what does not go into the report?
[03:44:55.460 --> 03:44:56.460]  Val: So it's not my decision.
[03:44:56.460 --> 03:44:59.460]  Val: I just give you all the data you ask for, right?
[03:44:59.460 --> 03:45:02.460]  Val: Without any omission, and someone else makes that decision.
[03:45:02.460 --> 03:45:03.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:45:03.460 --> 03:45:06.460]  Fed: Yeah, it's usually the case agent who would be working with you
[03:45:06.460 --> 03:45:09.460]  Fed: who would say, okay, hey, I'm going to write this report.
[03:45:09.460 --> 03:45:12.460]  Fed: And we write it in a way that doesn't disclose everything, right?
[03:45:12.460 --> 03:45:14.460]  Fed: Because if I write your name in my report...
[03:45:14.460 --> 03:45:16.460]  Fed: It protects your identity, but it's still...
[03:45:16.460 --> 03:45:18.460]  Fed: It doesn't hide anything.
[03:45:18.460 --> 03:45:23.460]  Val: We'll often put you guys in position to make you look bad,
[03:45:23.460 --> 03:45:25.460]  Val: but, you know, try to get it.
[03:45:25.460 --> 03:45:26.460]  Val: Try to get it.
[03:45:26.460 --> 03:45:27.460]  Fed: So anyway...
[03:45:27.460 --> 03:45:29.460]  Val: Cover your ass and get it.
[03:45:29.460 --> 03:45:30.460]  Fed: Right.
[03:45:30.460 --> 03:45:32.460]  Fed: That's just the general way we work with people
[03:45:32.460 --> 03:45:34.460]  Fed: because we work with a lot of different people
[03:45:34.460 --> 03:45:35.460]  Fed: in a lot of different areas of life.
[03:45:35.460 --> 03:45:38.460]  Fed: Like, I work drugs and drug dealers on my account,
[03:45:38.460 --> 03:45:40.460]  Fed: and, you know, we work with them.
[03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:41.460]  Val: [???] drug dealers?
[03:45:41.460 --> 03:45:42.460]  Fed: Mm-hmm.
[03:45:42.460 --> 03:45:43.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:45:43.460 --> 03:45:44.460]  Fed: Because we've got to work our way into the chain.
[03:45:44.460 --> 03:45:45.460]  Fed: How else do you think...
[03:45:45.460 --> 03:45:46.460]  Fed: You can't just get the runners all day, right?
[03:45:46.460 --> 03:45:47.460]  Val: Right.
[03:45:47.460 --> 03:45:49.460]  Fed: You get in the tenants and you get the people at the top
[03:45:49.460 --> 03:45:50.460]  Fed: and try to...
[03:45:51.460 --> 03:45:52.460]  Val: I don't get it.
[03:45:53.460 --> 03:45:54.460]  Val: It's completely...
[03:45:54.460 --> 03:45:55.460]  Val: It's completely...
[03:45:55.460 --> 03:45:57.460]  Fed: Kind of like what we said downstairs.
[03:45:57.460 --> 03:45:59.460]  Fed: It 's hard, right?
[03:45:59.460 --> 03:46:01.460]  Fed: It's hard to do this job,
[03:46:01.460 --> 03:46:02.460]  Fed: but it should be hard.
[03:46:02.460 --> 03:46:03.460]  Val: Because of the rules?
[03:46:03.460 --> 03:46:04.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:46:04.460 --> 03:46:05.460]  Fed: I mean, the rules are hard.
[03:46:05.460 --> 03:46:08.460]  Fed: Because that thing would be easy for us to do.
[03:46:08.460 --> 03:46:10.460]  Fed: But we're with the new rules.
[03:46:10.460 --> 03:46:12.460]  Fed: That's why we're going to do it with the new rules.
[03:46:12.460 --> 03:46:14.460]  Fed: Because it's the right thing to do.
[03:46:14.460 --> 03:46:16.460]  Val: Is it like a chain of evidence or a thing?
[03:46:16.460 --> 03:46:17.460]  Val: Like, there's like a cartel.
[03:46:17.460 --> 03:46:19.460]  Val: You think, you know, there's a guy's IP address.
[03:46:19.460 --> 03:46:21.460]  Val: You know, there's email.
[03:46:21.460 --> 03:46:24.460]  Fed: So now that, like, drug dealers are using,
[03:46:24.460 --> 03:46:27.460]  Fed: like, the encrypted chat,
[03:46:27.460 --> 03:46:29.460]  Fed: it doesn't work to go to the telephone company
[03:46:29.460 --> 03:46:33.460]  Fed: and say, hey, we want to get a title-free on this cell phone
[03:46:33.460 --> 03:46:35.460]  Fed: so we can see all the types of things.
[03:46:35.460 --> 03:46:37.460]  Fed: That's all then in the water.
[03:46:37.460 --> 03:46:40.460]  Fed: And now in order to get their communication,
[03:46:40.460 --> 03:46:43.460]  Fed: like, you'd have to actually get a hold of the phone
[03:46:43.460 --> 03:46:44.460]  Fed: and put...
[03:46:44.460 --> 03:46:46.460]  Fed: And honestly, the way to do it is, like,
[03:46:46.460 --> 03:46:48.460]  Fed: you'd have to get someone inside the group.
[03:46:48.460 --> 03:46:50.460]  Val: Yeah, you clone the phone.
[03:46:50.460 --> 03:46:52.460]  Fed: Yeah, even then, like, you need someone to, like,
[03:46:52.460 --> 03:46:54.460]  20 or 70 men in that phone.
[03:46:54.460 --> 03:46:55.460]  Can it be an 8?
[03:46:55.460 --> 03:46:56.460]  Yeah, I got it.
[03:46:56.460 --> 03:46:58.460]  It still goes back to, like, that thing
[03:46:58.460 --> 03:47:00.460]  where you have to get someone inside.
[03:47:00.460 --> 03:47:02.460]  Fed: We can't just sit back and rely.
[03:47:02.460 --> 03:47:04.460]  Fed: Yeah, because it's not...
[03:47:04.460 --> 03:47:08.460]  Fed: It's because it's illegal to hack into the phone
[03:47:08.460 --> 03:47:12.460]  Fed: and to bring it back in Christian.
[03:47:12.460 --> 03:47:15.460]  Val: So even with a proper warrant, you cannot...
[03:47:15.460 --> 03:47:18.460]  Fed: Oh, yeah, exactly. With a proper warrant, you can't
[03:47:18.460 --> 03:47:21.460]  Fed: because the technology is against that now.
[03:47:21.460 --> 03:47:23.460]  Fed: ???
[03:47:23.460 --> 03:47:26.460]  Val: But if someone can still do it, it's still doable, right?
[03:47:26.460 --> 03:47:30.460]  Fed: Like, if someone was using some app that the data was still
[03:47:30.460 --> 03:47:32.460]  Fed: housed with the service provider,
[03:47:32.460 --> 03:47:34.460]  Fed: then, yeah, yeah, it would do it.
[03:47:34.460 --> 03:47:36.460]  Fed: Because it's legally within the bounds
[03:47:36.460 --> 03:47:39.460]  Fed: and that company legally has the content.
[03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:41.460]  Val: Is it too much for me to ask, like,
[03:47:41.460 --> 03:47:43.460]  Val: what is legally outside the bounds?
[03:47:43.460 --> 03:47:46.460]  Fed: [unintelligible]
[03:47:46.460 --> 03:47:49.460]  Val: And it's just an hacking situation.
[03:47:49.460 --> 03:47:52.460]  Val: Like, if you know a cartel guy and you have a warrant,
[03:47:52.460 --> 03:47:55.460]  Val: what can you legally not do?
[03:47:55.460 --> 03:47:58.460]  Val: Yeah, I think maybe it's easier.
[03:47:58.460 --> 03:48:00.460]  Val: I'm just curious.
[03:48:00.460 --> 03:48:04.460]  Fed: You can't break any law in order to get access to that guy.
[03:48:04.460 --> 03:48:06.460]  Val: Civil rights?
[03:48:06.460 --> 03:48:08.460]  Fed: No, we can't do the hacking.
[03:48:08.460 --> 03:48:09.460]  Val: You can't?
[03:48:09.460 --> 03:48:11.460]  Fed: Yeah, no, we can't.
[03:48:11.460 --> 03:48:13.460]  Fed: Yeah, [??] the hacking or anything.
[03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:15.460]  Fed: And giving a court order or a search warrant
[03:48:15.460 --> 03:48:18.460]  Fed: to an ISP or a telecom provider is not hacking.
[03:48:18.460 --> 03:48:21.460]  Fed: There's a law that says we can do that.
[03:48:21.460 --> 03:48:23.460]  Fed: The warrant is what permits us to get things
[03:48:23.460 --> 03:48:25.460]  Fed: that are under reasonable expectation of privacy,
[03:48:25.460 --> 03:48:27.460]  Fed: which is what you're hacking.
[03:48:27.460 --> 03:48:30.460]  Fed: You're hacking because it's not publicly available.
[03:48:30.460 --> 03:48:32.460]  Fed: So if you have to breach that expectation of privacy,
[03:48:32.460 --> 03:48:35.460]  Fed: we need a warrant as a government to get that.
[03:48:35.460 --> 03:48:37.460]  Fed: The warrant will specify what you can and can't do.
[03:48:37.460 --> 03:48:40.460]  Val: And you can breach the expectation of privacy.
[03:48:40.460 --> 03:48:43.460]  Fed: And if this is all to protect against, you know,
[03:48:43.460 --> 03:48:46.460]  Fed: all the crazy shit that goes on and abuses and things like that.
[03:48:46.460 --> 03:48:48.460]  Fed: So, like, I mean, as much as the government
[03:48:48.460 --> 03:48:50.460]  Fed: is kind of a fuck up shit show,
[03:48:50.460 --> 03:48:53.460]  Fed: I mean, it is put up in a way to protect people,
[03:48:53.460 --> 03:48:54.460]  Fed: protect American people.
[03:48:54.460 --> 03:48:56.460]  Fed: Their privacy, their liberty, things like that.
[03:48:56.460 --> 03:48:57.460]  Fed: So when people think like,
[03:48:57.460 --> 03:48:58.460]  Fed: like my mom does the same thing,
[03:48:58.460 --> 03:49:00.460]  Fed: she's like, well, are you reading my e-mail that [??]?
[03:49:00.460 --> 03:49:01.460]  Fed: I don't have time to read your e-mail.
[03:49:01.460 --> 03:49:02.460]  Fed: One.
[03:49:02.460 --> 03:49:04.460]  Fed: And two, like, why would I be reading your e-mail?
[03:49:04.460 --> 03:49:05.460]  Fed: That doesn't make any sense.
[03:49:05.460 --> 03:49:06.460]  Val: Trust me, I did it.
[03:49:06.460 --> 03:49:07.460]  Val: You don't want to read your mom's e-mail.
[03:49:07.460 --> 03:49:11.460]  Val: You don't want to do that.
[03:49:11.460 --> 03:49:13.460]  Fed: Can't go backwards.
[03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:14.460]  Val: You can't.
[03:49:16.460 --> 03:49:17.460]  Fed: Yeah, so there's...
[03:49:17.460 --> 03:49:18.460]  Val: I get it.
[03:49:18.460 --> 03:49:20.460]  Fed: Yeah, there's limitations that we work under, but...
[03:49:20.460 --> 03:49:21.460]  Val: I like that.
[03:49:21.460 --> 03:49:22.460]  Val: It's fine.
[03:49:22.460 --> 03:49:26.460]  Val: It's like, you know, everyone has to have a...
[03:49:26.460 --> 03:49:28.460]  Fed: Yeah, we play about the rules.
[03:49:28.460 --> 03:49:30.460]  Fed: But when we do win, right,
[03:49:30.460 --> 03:49:32.460]  Fed: when we do arrest someone or something like that,
[03:49:32.460 --> 03:49:34.460]  Fed: our cases are, you know, airtight, right?
[03:49:34.460 --> 03:49:36.460]  Fed: We've covered every angle that we can.
[03:49:36.460 --> 03:49:37.460]  Fed: We've got all the information,
[03:49:37.460 --> 03:49:39.460]  Fed: and we've vetted everything to make sure that,
[03:49:39.460 --> 03:49:40.460]  Fed: we have the right person, right?
[03:49:40.460 --> 03:49:42.460]  Fed: We want to make sure we have the right person,
[03:49:42.460 --> 03:49:44.460]  Fed: and we have everything that leads up to it.
[03:49:44.460 --> 03:49:46.460]  Fed: So, anyway, that's all just background
[03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:48.460]  Fed: on how we work and how we work with sources
[03:49:48.460 --> 03:49:49.460]  Fed: and stuff like that.
[03:49:49.460 --> 03:49:50.460]  Val: That's good.
[03:49:50.460 --> 03:49:52.460]  Val: I like to do extremely different things.
[03:49:52.460 --> 03:49:54.460]  Val: Cause, it's really like Tim and Jami.
[03:49:54.460 --> 03:49:56.460]  Val: Tim and Jami are very different.
[03:49:56.460 --> 03:49:58.460]  Fed: Yeah, because I think that's the other thing, too,
[03:49:58.460 --> 03:50:00.460]  Fed: is if we break the rules to get to our end of goal,
[03:50:00.460 --> 03:50:02.460]  Fed: how are we getting better than the bad guys?
[03:50:02.460 --> 03:50:03.460]  Val: Right.
[03:50:03.460 --> 03:50:04.460]  Val: Right, and justifying it.
[03:50:04.460 --> 03:50:05.460]  Fed: Yeah, it's easy.
[03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:07.460]  Fed: I mean, it'd be easy for me to hack into a bunch of stuff,
[03:50:07.460 --> 03:50:09.460]  Fed: but then I'm just a hacker.
[03:50:09.460 --> 03:50:12.460]  Fed: I'm just a criminal doing rogue stuff.
[03:50:12.460 --> 03:50:14.460]  Val: Oh, vigilante.
[03:50:14.460 --> 03:50:16.460]  Fed: True, but vigilante is just not far.
[03:50:16.460 --> 03:50:19.460]  Fed: Anyway, that goes a whole different term.
[03:50:19.460 --> 03:50:21.460]  Val: Let's say that for a Signal group.
[03:50:21.460 --> 03:50:22.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:50:24.460 --> 03:50:25.460]  Fed: So, what else do I have?
[03:50:25.460 --> 03:50:27.460]  Fed: Okay, we talked about Irish bank fraud.
[03:50:27.460 --> 03:50:31.460]  Fed: OCCP, you're an admin on Hunter.ddos.
[03:50:31.460 --> 03:50:32.460]  Val: Both.
[03:50:35.460 --> 03:50:37.460]  Fed: The use of OCCP.
[03:50:37.460 --> 03:50:38.460]  Val: OCCRP, yeah.
[03:50:38.460 --> 03:50:39.460]  Fed: OCCRP is down?
[03:50:39.460 --> 03:50:40.460]  Val: No, it's up.
[03:50:40.460 --> 03:50:41.460]  Fed: Okay, yeah.
[03:50:41.460 --> 03:50:42.460]  Fed: So, you're an admin on both?
[03:50:42.460 --> 03:50:43.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:50:43.460 --> 03:50:45.460]  Val: Well, I have an account.
[03:50:45.460 --> 03:50:46.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:50:46.460 --> 03:50:47.460]  Val: And...
[03:50:47.460 --> 03:50:49.460]  Val: I know how to understand the documents, too,
[03:50:49.460 --> 03:50:50.460]  Val: which is...
[03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:53.460]  Val: I've learned a lot from the government.
[03:50:53.460 --> 03:50:56.460]  Val: So, if you need to...
[03:50:56.460 --> 03:50:58.460]  Val: If you want to know what a CLO is,
[03:50:58.460 --> 03:51:00.460]  Val: why it's important that it happens in 2008
[03:51:00.460 --> 03:51:04.460]  Val: in Ireland versus the UK,
[03:51:04.460 --> 03:51:06.460]  Val: I can help you understand that.
[03:51:06.460 --> 03:51:07.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:51:08.460 --> 03:51:09.460]  Fed: Let's see.
[03:51:09.460 --> 03:51:10.460]  Fed: You have...
[03:51:10.460 --> 03:51:12.460]  Fed: David Eichrich has...
[03:51:12.460 --> 03:51:16.460]  Fed: Well, I guess he tasks you to get into Epstein's email
[03:51:16.460 --> 03:51:19.460]  Fed: and Epstein's wife's email.
[03:51:19.460 --> 03:51:21.460]  Val: You know what he's password was?
[03:51:21.460 --> 03:51:23.460]  Val: It's so funny.
[03:51:23.460 --> 03:51:24.460]  Val: It's G-21.
[03:51:30.460 --> 03:51:31.460]  Val: A little same job.
Fed: How long'd that take you?
Val: About five minutes.
[03:51:39.460 --> 03:51:41.460]  Val: You can just look at the old hacks from...
[03:51:41.460 --> 03:51:42.460]  Fed: Oh, right.
[03:51:42.460 --> 03:51:43.460]  Val: Yeah, pretty easy.
[03:51:43.460 --> 03:51:45.460]  Val: But don't tell anybody.
[03:51:45.460 --> 03:51:49.460]  Fed: You're also in a single group with Barrett,
[03:51:49.460 --> 03:51:54.460]  Fed: Emma, Xan, your friend,
[03:51:54.460 --> 03:51:56.460]  Fed: and like a hundred other people there.
[03:51:56.460 --> 03:51:57.460]  Val: And a lot of journalists.
[03:51:57.460 --> 03:51:58.460]  Fed: Journalists.
[03:51:58.460 --> 03:51:59.460]  Fed: Journalists.
[03:51:59.460 --> 03:52:00.460]  Fed: Journalists.
[03:52:00.460 --> 03:52:01.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:01.460 --> 03:52:02.460]  Fed: You're capable of doing some email hacks
[03:52:02.460 --> 03:52:06.460]  Fed: and then you'll do some light forensics.
[03:52:06.460 --> 03:52:08.460]  Fed: I guess with this single group...
[03:52:08.460 --> 03:52:09.460]  Val: I'm good with forensics
[03:52:09.460 --> 03:52:10.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:10.460 --> 03:52:11.460]  Val: Not light.
[03:52:11.460 --> 03:52:12.460]  Fed: That's...
[03:52:12.460 --> 03:52:13.460]  Val: I've been practicing a lot with that.
[03:52:13.460 --> 03:52:16.460]  Val: That's like my latest interest.
[03:52:16.460 --> 03:52:17.460]  Val: But mostly...
[03:52:17.460 --> 03:52:18.460]  Val: But with the software.
[03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:20.460]  Val: It happened, you know, not on my own.
[03:52:20.460 --> 03:52:22.460]  Val: I'm not coding it or writing it.
[03:52:22.460 --> 03:52:24.460]  Fed: I don't think many people are coding it
[03:52:24.460 --> 03:52:25.460]  Fed: or writing it themselves.
[03:52:25.460 --> 03:52:26.460]  Val: No? Ok good.
[03:52:26.460 --> 03:52:28.460]  Val: I think it's a little bit better than...
[03:52:28.460 --> 03:52:30.460]  Val: But yeah, with Magnet, it was open source.
[03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:32.460]  Val: But with Magnet, of course, it's better.
[03:52:32.460 --> 03:52:33.460]  Val: Yeah, it's not like that.
[03:52:33.460 --> 03:52:34.460]  Val: I can prove that to you.
[03:52:34.460 --> 03:52:37.460]  Val: You need to do a demonstration of that.
[03:52:37.460 --> 03:52:38.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:41.460]  Fed: In the Signal group, you said Barrett...
[03:52:41.460 --> 03:52:43.460]  Fed: Barrett said that he's not doing anything illegal.
[03:52:43.460 --> 03:52:44.460]  Fed: Is that right?
[03:52:44.460 --> 03:52:45.460]  Fed: Or not doing anything stupid?
[03:52:45.460 --> 03:52:46.460]  Val: No.
[03:52:46.460 --> 03:52:48.460]  Val: He's always saying something stupid.
[03:52:48.460 --> 03:52:50.460]  Val: But he's just, you know, he's just a rabblerouser.
[03:52:50.460 --> 03:52:53.460]  Val: Let's see what happens after he calms down a bit.
[03:52:53.460 --> 03:52:55.460]  Val: Because he's high a lot.
[03:52:55.460 --> 03:52:56.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:56.460 --> 03:52:57.460]  Val: He was very high.
[03:52:57.460 --> 03:52:59.460]  Val: And he was not happy.
[03:52:59.460 --> 03:53:01.460]  Val: So it was more worried about him.
[03:53:01.460 --> 03:53:03.460]  Val: No one really took it seriously.
[03:53:03.460 --> 03:53:06.460]  Fed: You said the rest of the stuff in that group is mainly...
[03:53:06.460 --> 03:53:08.460]  Fed: People miscontented about stuff.
[03:53:08.460 --> 03:53:09.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:53:09.460 --> 03:53:11.460]  Fed: You said these steps are basically just bitching a lot.
[03:53:11.460 --> 03:53:12.460]  Fed: But like...
[03:53:12.460 --> 03:53:14.460]  Val: A lot of, like, fuck Louise Mensch, you know...
[03:53:14.460 --> 03:53:17.460]  Val: And like, well, actually, I couldn't want to fuck Louise Mensch.
[03:53:17.460 --> 03:53:19.460]  Val: You know, like, well, why would you want to do that?
[03:53:19.460 --> 03:53:21.460]  Val: You know, it's like that stuff.
[03:53:21.460 --> 03:53:23.460]  Val: You know, look at this Twitter post.
[03:53:23.460 --> 03:53:26.460]  Val: Or this cop just beat up this woman on the street.
[03:53:26.460 --> 03:53:28.460]  Val: You know, there's a lot of that, too.
[03:53:28.460 --> 03:53:29.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:53:29.460 --> 03:53:30.460]  Val: With the riots and stuff.
[03:53:30.460 --> 03:53:31.460]  Fed: Sure.
[03:53:31.460 --> 03:53:35.460]  Val: But if you're asking if there's, like, organization or people are getting together and, you know...
[03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:38.460]  Val: I think they're very watched.
[03:53:38.460 --> 03:53:40.460]  Val: You know, there's no organization.
[03:53:40.460 --> 03:53:41.460]  Val: It's like, it's just chaos.
[03:53:41.460 --> 03:53:42.460]  Val: It's fun to see what happens.
[03:53:42.460 --> 03:53:44.460]  Val: It's like, might come out of it, yeah.
[03:53:44.460 --> 03:53:46.460]  Val: And I meet some interesting people.
[03:53:46.460 --> 03:53:48.460]  Fed: There's nothing, nothing explicitly illegal.
[03:53:48.460 --> 03:53:53.460]  Fed: They don't talk about, you know, collectivity or hacking stuff or anything like that.
[03:53:53.460 --> 03:53:54.460]  Val: Why?
[03:53:54.460 --> 03:53:55.460]  Val: Well, yeah, of course.
[03:53:55.460 --> 03:53:57.460]  Val: No, there is a talk about that, yeah.
[03:53:57.460 --> 03:53:59.460]  Val: But it's like a friend of mine says,
[03:53:59.460 --> 03:54:08.460]  Val: Oh, do you know how I get ISPs from Prague, you know, circa 2016?
[03:54:08.460 --> 03:54:10.460]  Val: Clearly, you're trying to find the Cohen shit, right?
[03:54:10.460 --> 03:54:12.460]  Val: You know, everyone's a loving the baby.
[03:54:12.460 --> 03:54:14.460]  Val: You know, stuff like that, you know.
[03:54:14.460 --> 03:54:16.460]  Val: And if you have it, you know where to get it.
[03:54:16.460 --> 03:54:18.460]  Val: Sure here you go
[03:54:18.460 --> 03:54:19.460]  Val: There's a link.
[03:54:19.460 --> 03:54:20.460]  Val: Do you know what Irish bankers are?
[03:54:20.460 --> 03:54:23.460]  Val: The other day, I mean, an Irish banker that knows how to do,
[03:54:23.460 --> 03:54:25.460]  Val: you know, anybody in Ireland right now.
[03:54:25.460 --> 03:54:27.460]  Val: I'm here to get some coin telegraph.
[03:54:27.460 --> 03:54:29.460]  Val: Yeah, stuff like that.
[03:54:29.460 --> 03:54:35.460]  Val: But like, I'm the only idiot that says, Hey, Emma,
[03:54:35.460 --> 03:54:38.460]  Val: can you give me a favor and help me hack David Enrich?
[03:54:38.460 --> 03:54:40.460]  Val: Because I got to get into his fucking email.
[03:54:40.460 --> 03:54:42.460]  Val: I'm the only idiot that says that.
[03:54:42.460 --> 03:54:44.460]  Val: So, yeah.
[03:54:44.460 --> 03:54:45.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:54:45.460 --> 03:54:48.460]  Fed: So no one else talked about like who's behind hack or who's behind it?
[03:54:48.460 --> 03:54:49.460]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[03:54:49.460 --> 03:54:50.460]  Val: I know.
[03:54:50.460 --> 03:54:51.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:54:51.460 --> 03:54:53.460]  Val: There's a really good big discussion on who's behind Lulz.
[03:54:53.460 --> 03:54:55.460]  Fed: Oh, LulzSec, I think.
[03:54:55.460 --> 03:55:00.460]  Val: Or, well, no, the abbreviated version of LulzSec.
[03:55:00.460 --> 03:55:01.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:55:01.460 --> 03:55:03.460]  Val: It's like a, whoever did the Cayman Islands
[03:55:03.460 --> 03:55:04.460]  Fed: Oh, yeah.
[03:55:04.460 --> 03:55:06.460]  Fed: Who do they think is behind the Cayman Islands?
[03:55:06.460 --> 03:55:09.460]  Fed: I said they, I mean, what are some of the opinions of?
[03:55:09.460 --> 03:55:12.460]  Val: All I know is my opinion right now, as I can remember,
[03:55:12.460 --> 03:55:14.460]  Val: and I'm not holding back or meaning information,
[03:55:14.460 --> 03:55:16.460]  Val: because I just can't remember.
[03:55:16.460 --> 03:55:18.460]  Val: But if you give me time to look, I'll find it for you.
[03:55:18.460 --> 03:55:21.460]  Val: My opinion is, I think it's Emma.
[03:55:21.460 --> 03:55:24.460]  Val: The Spanish, the Spanish is broken.
[03:55:24.460 --> 03:55:27.460]  Val: Again, Marie speaks eight languages.
[03:55:27.460 --> 03:55:29.460]  Val: She told me it's not a first.
[03:55:29.460 --> 03:55:30.460]  Fed: It's not a native speaker.
[03:55:30.460 --> 03:55:31.460]  Val: It's not a native speaker.
[03:55:31.460 --> 03:55:36.460]  Val: And the angry, the anger sort of matches Emma's anger.
[03:55:36.460 --> 03:55:39.460]  Val: And the thought process that makes, gets you to write a certain sentence,
[03:55:39.460 --> 03:55:41.460]  Val: matches her thought process.
[03:55:41.460 --> 03:55:42.460]  Val: The way I figured it anyway.
[03:55:42.460 --> 03:55:44.460]  Val: You know, you have to, in order to say the certain sentence,
[03:55:44.460 --> 03:55:46.460]  Val: you have to think and feel the sort of thing.
[03:55:46.460 --> 03:55:48.460]  Val: We're in the, we're in this frame group.
[03:55:48.460 --> 03:55:50.460]  Val: And I see that pattern matched with it.
[03:55:50.460 --> 03:55:54.460]  Fed: So what Spanish document was it that matched?
[03:55:54.460 --> 03:55:55.460]  Val: The manifesto.
[03:55:55.460 --> 03:55:56.460]  Fed: Oh, the manifesto.
[03:55:57.460 --> 03:55:58.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:55:58.460 --> 03:55:59.460]  Fed: Interesting.
[03:55:59.460 --> 03:56:00.460]  Fed: So aside from like the speech pattern,
[03:56:00.460 --> 03:56:02.460]  Fed: is there anything else, any other reason why you think
[03:56:02.460 --> 03:56:04.460]  Fed: that Best is behind the Cayman Islands?
[03:56:04.460 --> 03:56:07.460]  Val: Well, the thought process, obviously.
[03:56:07.460 --> 03:56:08.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:56:08.460 --> 03:56:09.460]  Fed: The motivation, I guess, right?
[03:56:09.460 --> 03:56:10.460]  Val: It's really angry.
[03:56:10.460 --> 03:56:11.460]  Val: Well, no, no more.
[03:56:11.460 --> 03:56:14.460]  Val: The motivation, well, you must know.
[03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:16.460]  Val: I mean, if you're a hacker, you know,
[03:56:16.460 --> 03:56:19.460]  Val: the motivation is just, you can do it.
[03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:21.460]  Val: You know, sometimes, yeah, you're broke, you need some money.
[03:56:21.460 --> 03:56:24.460]  Val: Or if you want to, you know, see, I'm better than you or not.
[03:56:24.460 --> 03:56:26.460]  Val: But it's like, here's a challenge.
[03:56:26.460 --> 03:56:28.460]  Val: You know, that's most of the motivation.
[03:56:28.460 --> 03:56:30.460]  Val: You should know that though, right?
[03:56:30.460 --> 03:56:31.460]  Fed: But it's different, too.
[03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:32.460]  Val: Oh, you mean political motivation.
[03:56:32.460 --> 03:56:33.460]  Fed: There's different motivations, too,
[03:56:33.460 --> 03:56:34.460]  Fed: with different hackers, too, right?
[03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:36.460]  Fed: Some hackers are just curious.
[03:56:36.460 --> 03:56:38.460]  Fed: Like, they just want to see if they can break the system.
[03:56:38.460 --> 03:56:40.460]  Fed: But they're the ones who hack for a purpose, right?
[03:56:40.460 --> 03:56:42.460]  Fed: Like, a lot of the hacktivists out there,
[03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:43.460]  Fed: you know, they'll hack because...
[03:56:43.460 --> 03:56:44.460]  Val: BlueLeaks.
[03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:45.460]  Fed: What about...
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:47.460]  Val: We're talking about BlueLeaks, aren't we?
[03:56:47.460 --> 03:56:48.460]  Fed: What about BlueLeaks leak?
[03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:50.460]  Val: That's what you're asking about.
[03:56:50.460 --> 03:56:52.460]  Fed: Well, there's a bunch of different types of things.
[03:56:52.460 --> 03:56:53.460]  Val: I don't know.
[03:56:53.460 --> 03:56:58.460]  Val: So, the BlueLeaks appeared on...
[03:56:58.460 --> 03:57:01.460]  Val: Honestly, I don't know why you're going after Emma.
[03:57:01.460 --> 03:57:03.460]  Val: I don't think she did it.
[03:57:03.460 --> 03:57:05.460]  Val: First of all, I think she did the Cayman one.
[03:57:05.460 --> 03:57:06.460]  Val: I don't think he did BlueLeaks.
[03:57:06.460 --> 03:57:08.460]  Val: BlueLeaks was...
[03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:11.460]  Val: But you know, and I'm sure you know,
[03:57:11.460 --> 03:57:15.460]  Val: and I'm sure you know that your computer systems are outdated.
[03:57:15.460 --> 03:57:16.460]  Val: Right?
[03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:17.460]  Val: Okay?
[03:57:17.460 --> 03:57:19.460]  Val: They're fucking really outdated, right?
[03:57:19.460 --> 03:57:22.460]  Val: And the FBI's computer systems are outdated.
[03:57:22.460 --> 03:57:25.460]  Val: What do you think the local sheriff's fucking office in Minnesota
[03:57:25.460 --> 03:57:28.460]  Val: is still running, like, Windows NT, right?
[03:57:28.460 --> 03:57:31.460]  Val: So, it's not difficult, you know?
[03:57:31.460 --> 03:57:34.460]  Val: And I think it's consortium.
[03:57:34.460 --> 03:57:37.460]  Val: My personal opinion, based on no evidence at all,
[03:57:37.460 --> 03:57:42.460]  Val: is that a consortium hackers was pissed off about the...
[03:57:42.460 --> 03:57:44.460]  Val: the Black Lives Matter, I think, cause fuck the police
[03:57:44.460 --> 03:57:46.460]  Val: and here's the revenge.
[03:57:46.460 --> 03:57:49.460]  Val: I don't think it was, you know,
[03:57:49.460 --> 03:57:51.460]  Val: politically motivated by...
[03:57:51.460 --> 03:57:56.460]  Val: motivated by some, like, left-wing George Soros fucking thing.
[03:57:56.460 --> 03:57:58.460]  Val: You know, conspiracy theory, right?
[03:57:58.460 --> 03:58:00.460]  Val: Just angry kids, you know?
[03:58:00.460 --> 03:58:01.460]  Val: That's it.
[03:58:01.460 --> 03:58:02.460]  Val: That's right.
[03:58:02.460 --> 03:58:03.460]  Val: But I could be wrong.
[03:58:03.460 --> 03:58:05.460]  Val: I'm often wrong.
[03:58:05.460 --> 03:58:07.460]  Fed: So, you don't think Emma Best's behind that
[03:58:07.460 --> 03:58:09.460]  Fed: But she's behind Cayman Islands and what else?
[03:58:09.460 --> 03:58:11.460]  Val: I personally, I think, Cayman yes.
[03:58:11.460 --> 03:58:15.460]  Val: Because just her reaction to my asking for the 100,000
[03:58:15.460 --> 03:58:18.460]  Val: in Bitcoin, Deutsche Bank, was sort of tipped me off.
[03:58:18.460 --> 03:58:21.460]  Val: You don't react like that if you're just the middle person.
[03:58:21.460 --> 03:58:23.460]  Fed: Interesting.
[03:58:23.460 --> 03:58:26.460]  Fed: Yeah, because she doesn't want to share it, though.
[03:58:26.460 --> 03:58:27.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:58:27.460 --> 03:58:31.460]  Fed: There's a prize attached to it, so...
[03:58:31.460 --> 03:58:32.460]  Fed: so there was...
[03:58:32.460 --> 03:58:33.460]  Fed: so that...
[03:58:33.460 --> 03:58:35.460]  Fed: you said there was, like, a lot of discussion about who...
[03:58:35.460 --> 03:58:37.460]  Fed: or who did the Cayman thing that there was a lot of discussion
[03:58:37.460 --> 03:58:39.460]  Fed: in the group of who...
[03:58:39.460 --> 03:58:40.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:58:40.460 --> 03:58:44.460]  Fed: But just for the Caymans thing right now, so...
[03:58:44.460 --> 03:58:46.460]  Val: Well, Formations House as well.
[03:58:46.460 --> 03:58:48.460]  Val: I've done it before.
[03:58:48.460 --> 03:58:51.460]  Val: But actually, there was no discussion.
[03:58:51.460 --> 03:58:52.460]  Val: That's interesting.
[03:58:52.460 --> 03:58:53.460]  Val: You have a good point.
[03:58:53.460 --> 03:58:55.460]  Val: Yeah, there was no discussion for Formation House.
[03:58:55.460 --> 03:58:57.460]  Val: That means that Emma already knew who did it.
[03:58:57.460 --> 03:58:58.460]  Fed: Oh, yeah.
[03:58:58.460 --> 03:59:00.460]  Val: So that's why it's the way I take out statements.
[03:59:00.460 --> 03:59:01.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:59:01.460 --> 03:59:03.460]  Val: But since there was a lot of discussion for, like,
[03:59:03.460 --> 03:59:06.460]  Val: Caymans, that means no one really knew who did it.
[03:59:06.460 --> 03:59:08.460]  Fed: Who did Formations House?
[03:59:08.460 --> 03:59:09.460]  Val: I don't know.
[03:59:09.460 --> 03:59:10.460]  Val: It wasn't you.
[03:59:10.460 --> 03:59:11.460]  Val: I just joined the...
[03:59:11.460 --> 03:59:12.460]  Val: the thing in the...
[03:59:12.460 --> 03:59:14.460]  Val: well, Marie was stuck in France,
[03:59:14.460 --> 03:59:16.460]  Val: so that was the summer of last year.
[03:59:16.460 --> 03:59:18.460]  Val: That's when that happened.
[03:59:18.460 --> 03:59:20.460]  Val: But I did tell Tim Jammi? like,
[03:59:20.460 --> 03:59:22.460]  Val: hey, new data.
[03:59:22.460 --> 03:59:23.460]  Val: You know?
[03:59:23.460 --> 03:59:24.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:59:24.460 --> 03:59:26.460]  Val: And, oh, God, oh, the whip, yeah.
[03:59:26.460 --> 03:59:28.460]  Val: Okay, so I...
[03:59:28.460 --> 03:59:30.460]  Val: at this point, I'm, everyone knows,
[03:59:30.460 --> 03:59:32.460]  Val: I was working with the FBI, the source.
[03:59:32.460 --> 03:59:33.460]  Val: Well, Emma said to me,
[03:59:33.460 --> 03:59:36.460]  Val: I need you to relay a message to the FBI.
[03:59:36.460 --> 03:59:37.460]  Val: I was like, what?
[03:59:37.460 --> 03:59:39.460]  Val: She said, yes, I want you to give these guys a message.
[03:59:39.460 --> 03:59:40.460]  Val: Okay.
[03:59:40.460 --> 03:59:42.460]  Val: She's like, tell them about Formation Towns.
[03:59:42.460 --> 03:59:45.460]  Val: I want you to give them a list of people you've...
[03:59:45.460 --> 03:59:46.460]  Val: that are...
[03:59:46.460 --> 03:59:47.460]  Val: and I have it.
[03:59:47.460 --> 03:59:48.460]  Val: I can give you the email.
[03:59:48.460 --> 03:59:50.460]  Val: I'll just forward it to you when I get a chance.
[03:59:50.460 --> 03:59:51.460]  Val: Remind me, text me.
[03:59:51.460 --> 03:59:52.460]  Val: I don't forget.
[03:59:52.460 --> 03:59:54.460]  Val: And I gave it to Tim.
[03:59:54.460 --> 03:59:55.460]  Val: I gave it to Jeremy.[???]
[03:59:55.460 --> 03:59:56.460]  Val: And they were not...
[03:59:56.460 --> 03:59:57.460]  Val: they were like, okay, great.
[03:59:57.460 --> 03:59:58.460]  Val: We don't really care.
[03:59:58.460 --> 03:59:59.460]  Val: Like, give one to a Deutsche Bank.
[03:59:59.460 --> 04:00:01.460]  Val: We don't care about Formation Towns.
[04:00:01.460 --> 04:00:04.460]  Val: And Emma felt like she was not heard by the FBI
[04:00:04.460 --> 04:00:06.460]  Val: because she wanted to help,
[04:00:06.460 --> 04:00:08.460]  Val: but she was not heard.
[04:00:08.460 --> 04:00:09.460]  Val: She was offering help.
[04:00:09.460 --> 04:00:12.460]  Val: She said, look, I'll give you guys the data.
[04:00:12.460 --> 04:00:13.460]  Val: You have a time limit.
[04:00:13.460 --> 04:00:15.460]  Val: That's why it's going to go live in a month.
[04:00:15.460 --> 04:00:18.460]  Val: I'll give you three months to find the information.
[04:00:18.460 --> 04:00:20.460]  Val: I'll forward it to you.
[04:00:20.460 --> 04:00:21.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:00:21.460 --> 04:00:23.460]  Fed: I'm just writing a line to someone to text you.
[04:00:23.460 --> 04:00:24.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:00:24.460 --> 04:00:26.460]  Fed: I don't know if we got it.
[04:00:26.460 --> 04:00:28.460]  Fed: That's what I'm writing.
[04:00:28.460 --> 04:00:30.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:00:30.460 --> 04:00:31.460]  Fed: All right.
[04:00:31.460 --> 04:00:33.460]  Fed: Any other signal groups that...
[04:00:33.460 --> 04:00:35.460]  Fed: that you're part of that talk about hacking?
[04:00:35.460 --> 04:00:36.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:00:36.460 --> 04:00:37.460]  Val: Well, they're all...
[04:00:37.460 --> 04:00:39.460]  Val: I mean, all the varied groups.
[04:00:39.460 --> 04:00:41.460]  Val: I call them varied groups, but they're all, like, off-shoots.
[04:00:41.460 --> 04:00:42.460]  Fed: Oh, ok.
[04:00:42.460 --> 04:00:44.460]  Val: The Formations House one is still like this.
[04:00:44.460 --> 04:00:46.460]  Val: But, you know, it's like...
[04:00:46.460 --> 04:00:48.460]  Val: Well, I mean, no one's really posted for like,
[04:00:48.460 --> 04:00:49.460]  Val: like seven months.
[04:00:49.460 --> 04:00:50.460]  Val: Still there.
[04:00:50.460 --> 04:00:51.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:00:51.460 --> 04:00:53.460]  Val: And I created a few groups of my own, you know,
[04:00:53.460 --> 04:00:55.460]  Val: a Deutsche Bank group.
[04:00:55.460 --> 04:00:56.460]  Val: Journalists like a Luke Harding
[04:00:56.460 --> 04:00:58.460]  Val: and bunch of other journalists.
[04:00:58.460 --> 04:01:00.460]  Val: Oh, and every...
[04:01:00.460 --> 04:01:01.460]  Val: there's every...
[04:01:01.460 --> 04:01:03.460]  Val: once in a while, there's like a fun star chamber
[04:01:03.460 --> 04:01:06.460]  Val: where you get someone and everyone's going to stop at
[04:01:06.460 --> 04:01:09.460]  Val: and we put them in a group, you know, and we just sort of tap.
[04:01:09.460 --> 04:01:11.460]  Val: You know, see what they say.
[04:01:11.460 --> 04:01:12.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:01:12.460 --> 04:01:14.460]  Val: Well, like Louise Mensch, she put her in a group
[04:01:14.460 --> 04:01:16.460]  Val: and he started, you know, what the fuck are you doing?
[04:01:16.460 --> 04:01:18.460]  Val: Why did you say this about Scott's father?
[04:01:18.460 --> 04:01:19.460]  Val: Scott Steadman's father is a cop.
[04:01:19.460 --> 04:01:20.460]  Fed: Oh.
[04:01:20.460 --> 04:01:21.460]  Val: She doxxed me.
[04:01:21.460 --> 04:01:22.460]  Fed: Oh.
[04:01:22.460 --> 04:01:23.460]  Val: What the fuck are you doing?
[04:01:23.460 --> 04:01:24.460]  Val: Why are you going after his father?
[04:01:24.460 --> 04:01:26.460]  Val: You know, she's like, well, he's a Russian spy.
[04:01:26.460 --> 04:01:27.460]  Val: You know, you're just fucking crazy.
[04:01:27.460 --> 04:01:29.460]  Val: Do you understand what you're fucking doing?
[04:01:29.460 --> 04:01:30.460]  Val: That's weird.
[04:01:30.460 --> 04:01:31.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:01:31.460 --> 04:01:32.460]  Val: I think...
[04:01:32.460 --> 04:01:34.460]  Val: Like, David Enrich was supposed to be in one
[04:01:34.460 --> 04:01:37.460]  Val: right before COVID, the next guy.
[04:01:37.460 --> 04:01:38.460]  Val: It was a prize.
[04:01:38.460 --> 04:01:40.460]  Val: It was a present for me.
[04:01:40.460 --> 04:01:43.460]  Fed: It's like a little beat down room.
[04:01:43.460 --> 04:01:44.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:01:44.460 --> 04:01:45.460]  Fed: That's weird.
[04:01:45.460 --> 04:01:47.460]  Fed: Hey, what are you talking about?
[04:01:47.460 --> 04:01:48.460]  Fed: What are you talking about?
[04:01:48.460 --> 04:01:49.460]  Fed: I'm talking about you.
[04:01:49.460 --> 04:01:50.460]  Fed: What?
[04:01:50.460 --> 04:01:51.460]  Fed: Cool.
[04:01:51.460 --> 04:01:53.460]  Fed: Anything else that I missed?
[04:01:53.460 --> 04:01:55.460]  Fed: Anything else that you think that...
[04:01:55.460 --> 04:01:56.460]  Val: Yes.
[04:01:56.460 --> 04:01:57.460]  Val: Tons of stuff
[04:01:57.460 --> 04:01:58.460]  Val: I can't remember all I have.
[04:01:58.460 --> 04:01:59.460]  Fed: Yeah, sure.
[04:01:59.460 --> 04:02:01.460]  Val: But if you ask me
[04:02:01.460 --> 04:02:03.460]  Val: If I remember...
[04:02:03.460 --> 04:02:05.460]  Val: I just...
[04:02:05.460 --> 04:02:07.460]  Val: I will remember it.
[04:02:07.460 --> 04:02:09.460]  Val: I have to be in a mindset.
[04:02:09.460 --> 04:02:10.460]  Fed: Sure.
[04:02:10.460 --> 04:02:12.460]  Val: You know, I mean, like...
[04:02:12.460 --> 04:02:14.460]  Val: your memory is...
[04:02:14.460 --> 04:02:15.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:02:16.460 --> 04:02:18.460]  Fed: Yeah, if I was going to ask you about something very specific.
[04:02:18.460 --> 04:02:20.460]  Fed: You could recall more about them.
[04:02:20.460 --> 04:02:21.460]  Fed: Tell me everything you know about everything.
[04:02:21.460 --> 04:02:23.460]  Val: And right now, I'm like a...
[04:02:23.460 --> 04:02:24.460]  Val: I'm not even active anymore.
[04:02:24.460 --> 04:02:26.460]  Val: I'm [???] stuff right now from my memory
[04:02:26.460 --> 04:02:27.460]  Val: because I'm in this room.
[04:02:27.460 --> 04:02:28.460]  Val: And I'm a little bit nervous.
[04:02:28.460 --> 04:02:29.460]  Val: I'm a bit not nervous.
[04:02:29.460 --> 04:02:31.460]  Val: So my brain is adapted to that point.
[04:02:31.460 --> 04:02:33.460]  Val: So as soon as I walk out of the room,
[04:02:33.460 --> 04:02:34.460]  Val: I'm like, oh, we're going to say that.
[04:02:34.460 --> 04:02:35.460]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[04:02:35.460 --> 04:02:36.460]  Val: You know what I mean?
[04:02:36.460 --> 04:02:37.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:02:37.460 --> 04:02:38.460]  Fed: So...
[04:02:38.460 --> 04:02:39.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:02:39.460 --> 04:02:40.460]  Fed: Anything else that...
[04:02:40.460 --> 04:02:41.460]  Fed: Oh, in turn?
[04:02:41.460 --> 04:02:42.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:02:42.460 --> 04:02:43.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:02:43.460 --> 04:02:44.460]  Fed: Well, you still have my number so if like
[04:02:44.460 --> 04:02:46.460]  Fed: you think of something that...
[04:02:46.460 --> 04:02:48.460]  Fed: you think would be interested in, you know...
[04:02:48.460 --> 04:02:49.460]  Fed: surely you can always let me know
[04:02:49.460 --> 04:02:50.460]  Fed: and I can find a home for it.
[04:02:50.460 --> 04:02:51.460]  Val: You think?
[04:02:51.460 --> 04:02:53.460]  Val: And do you mean to prosecute?
[04:02:53.460 --> 04:02:54.460]  Val: Do you mean to go after it?
[04:02:54.460 --> 04:02:57.460]  Val: Do you mean to like to read that is...
[04:02:57.460 --> 04:02:58.460]  Val: that needs to be stopped?
[04:02:58.460 --> 04:02:59.460]  Val: Or would you say it's like,
[04:02:59.460 --> 04:03:02.460]  Val: oh, there's some fun just in hacks happening?
[04:03:02.460 --> 04:03:03.460]  Val: What do you mean?
[04:03:03.460 --> 04:03:05.460]  Fed: I mean, all those things are...
[04:03:05.460 --> 04:03:08.460]  Fed: I work a very narrow spectrum, right?
[04:03:08.460 --> 04:03:09.460]  Fed: I work cyber-crime.
[04:03:09.460 --> 04:03:10.460]  Val: Okay.
[04:03:10.460 --> 04:03:11.460]  Val: But there's...
[04:03:11.460 --> 04:03:12.460]  Val: You're fraud, though.
[04:03:12.460 --> 04:03:13.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:03:13.460 --> 04:03:15.460]  Fed: But there's also like counter-terrorism
[04:03:15.460 --> 04:03:16.460]  Fed: or white collar crimes
[04:03:16.460 --> 04:03:18.460]  Fed: or crimes against some children
[04:03:18.460 --> 04:03:20.460]  Fed: and national security threats.
[04:03:20.460 --> 04:03:22.460]  Val: Oh, there's a couple lawyers.
[04:03:22.460 --> 04:03:23.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:03:23.460 --> 04:03:24.460]  Val: So I get...
[04:03:24.460 --> 04:03:25.460]  Val: There's people that call...
[04:03:25.460 --> 04:03:27.460]  Val: they claim to be lawyers.
[04:03:27.460 --> 04:03:28.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:03:28.460 --> 04:03:30.460]  Val: And they ask me to do a bunch of stuff.
[04:03:30.460 --> 04:03:32.460]  Val: First they ask for the Deutsche Bank data
[04:03:32.460 --> 04:03:34.460]  Val: and then they say they're fighting and doing a lawsuit
[04:03:34.460 --> 04:03:36.460]  Val: against like Iran or something like that
[04:03:36.460 --> 04:03:39.460]  Val: on behalf of the veterans.
[04:03:39.460 --> 04:03:41.460]  Val: They have to go collect data for them.
[04:03:41.460 --> 04:03:43.460]  Val: And it's mostly just...
[04:03:43.460 --> 04:03:45.460]  Val: I don't know why they're asking.
[04:03:45.460 --> 04:03:47.460]  Val: I thought it was some spy.
[04:03:47.460 --> 04:03:49.460]  Fed: Oh, like you think they were asking...
[04:03:49.460 --> 04:03:51.460]  Fed: when they collect data,
[04:03:51.460 --> 04:03:53.460]  Fed: you think it was one of the most...
[04:03:53.460 --> 04:03:54.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:03:54.460 --> 04:03:56.460]  Val: They're asking you to hack it.
[04:03:56.460 --> 04:03:59.460]  Val: And I know these two guys out of DC...
[04:03:59.460 --> 04:04:01.460]  Val: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[04:04:01.460 --> 04:04:02.460]  Val: They...
[04:04:02.460 --> 04:04:03.460]  Val: I told them to go fuck off,
[04:04:03.460 --> 04:04:04.460]  Val: but they did fly out here.
[04:04:04.460 --> 04:04:05.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:04:05.460 --> 04:04:07.460]  Fed: I mean, they had their e-mail accounts.
[04:04:07.460 --> 04:04:08.460]  Fed: Yeah, no.
[04:04:08.460 --> 04:04:10.460]  Val: [Unintelligible] do you mind if I do that for you?
[04:04:10.460 --> 04:04:11.460]  Fed: Sure.
[04:04:11.460 --> 04:04:12.460]  Val: Because they're...
[04:04:12.460 --> 04:04:13.460]  Val: there's something about them that's very off.
[04:04:13.460 --> 04:04:15.460]  Val: They flew all the way out here from DC
[04:04:15.460 --> 04:04:18.460]  Val: and then there was a very weird fucking...
[04:04:18.460 --> 04:04:19.460]  Val: there was a weird experience
[04:04:19.460 --> 04:04:20.460]  Val: what happened after that.
[04:04:20.460 --> 04:04:21.460]  Val: I'll tell you the story.
[04:04:21.460 --> 04:04:22.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:04:22.460 --> 04:04:25.460]  Fed: You did this to hack into Iran?
[04:04:25.460 --> 04:04:28.460]  Val: No, no, they wanted...
[04:04:28.460 --> 04:04:30.460]  Val: wire information about money being sent
[04:04:30.460 --> 04:04:33.460]  Val: from anywhere, any bank to Iran
[04:04:33.460 --> 04:04:36.460]  Val: during 2009.
[04:04:36.460 --> 04:04:38.460]  Val: It was just during the Gulf War, please.
[04:04:38.460 --> 04:04:39.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:04:39.460 --> 04:04:42.460]  Val: Well, it actually included Iran in 2010 as well.
[04:04:42.460 --> 04:04:43.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:04:43.460 --> 04:04:44.460]  Fed: I'll...
[04:04:44.460 --> 04:04:46.460]  Fed: I'll e-mail you and do one.
[04:04:46.460 --> 04:04:47.460]  Fed: But, um...
[04:04:47.460 --> 04:04:49.460]  Fed: So the plan right now is...
[04:04:49.460 --> 04:04:50.460]  Val: I know a Russian guy.
[04:04:50.460 --> 04:04:52.460]  Val: He works FSA
[04:04:52.460 --> 04:04:53.460]  Val: FSB.
[04:04:53.460 --> 04:04:54.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:04:54.460 --> 04:04:55.460]  Val: Or he used to work for us.
[04:04:55.460 --> 04:04:56.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:04:56.460 --> 04:04:58.460]  Val: And he really wants to be an American.
[04:04:58.460 --> 04:05:00.460]  Val: So he can be of very...
[04:05:00.460 --> 04:05:02.460]  Val: very useful guy to you.
[04:05:02.460 --> 04:05:03.460]  Fed: What's his name?
[04:05:03.460 --> 04:05:04.460]  Val: Dmitri.
[04:05:04.460 --> 04:05:05.460]  Fed: Dmitri?
[04:05:05.460 --> 04:05:06.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:05:06.460 --> 04:05:08.460]  Val: But be careful, because, like, you know,
[04:05:08.460 --> 04:05:09.460]  Val: he's being monitored.
[04:05:09.460 --> 04:05:10.460]  Fed: Mm-hmm.
[04:05:10.460 --> 04:05:11.460]  Val: So, uh...
[04:05:11.460 --> 04:05:13.460]  Val: you know, a person died. [??]
[04:05:13.460 --> 04:05:14.460]  Val: I did not want to...
[04:05:14.460 --> 04:05:15.460]  Val: he was a good guy.
[04:05:15.460 --> 04:05:16.460]  Val: He was a good guy.
[04:05:16.460 --> 04:05:17.460]  Fed: Or is he good?
[04:05:17.460 --> 04:05:18.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:05:18.460 --> 04:05:19.460]  Val: He's traveling all over the world.
[04:05:19.460 --> 04:05:20.460]  Val: He doesn't have to go back to Russia.
[04:05:20.460 --> 04:05:21.460]  Val: He keeps being...
[04:05:21.460 --> 04:05:22.460]  Val: getting his visa
[04:05:22.460 --> 04:05:23.460]  Val: He's accepted.
[04:05:23.460 --> 04:05:25.460]  Val: So he doesn't have to go back.
[04:05:25.460 --> 04:05:27.460]  Val: And he keeps trying to, you know,
[04:05:27.460 --> 04:05:29.460]  Val: ask me all, like,
[04:05:29.460 --> 04:05:31.460]  Val: is there a way or a business?
[04:05:31.460 --> 04:05:32.460]  Val: Can you introduce me to someone?
[04:05:32.460 --> 04:05:33.460]  Val: So, like, Val...
[04:05:33.460 --> 04:05:35.460]  Val: He's a really good coder.
[04:05:35.460 --> 04:05:36.460]  Fed: I don't know.
[04:05:36.460 --> 04:05:37.460]  Val: He's a good kind of guy.
[04:05:37.460 --> 04:05:38.460]  Val: But, yeah.
[04:05:38.460 --> 04:05:39.460]  Val: Uh, that would be very helpful for you,
[04:05:39.460 --> 04:05:40.460]  Val: because he does know a lot.
[04:05:40.460 --> 04:05:41.460]  Fed: Well, how do you...
[04:05:41.460 --> 04:05:42.460]  Fed: How do you know him?
[04:05:42.460 --> 04:05:43.460]  Val: Traveling
[04:05:43.460 --> 04:05:44.460]  Fed: Uh-huh, traveling.
[04:05:44.460 --> 04:05:45.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:05:45.460 --> 04:05:46.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:05:46.460 --> 04:05:47.460]  Val: He has a girlfriend.
[04:05:47.460 --> 04:05:48.460]  Val: Girlfriend is the daughter
[04:05:48.460 --> 04:05:50.460]  Val: of a military general.
[04:05:50.460 --> 04:05:51.460]  Val: That's why.
[04:05:51.460 --> 04:05:52.460]  Val: Very interesting.
[04:05:52.460 --> 04:05:54.460]  Val: Um, I think he was the...
[04:05:54.460 --> 04:05:55.460]  Val: he was a...
[04:05:55.460 --> 04:05:58.460]  Val: he was tired of making military journals.
[04:05:58.460 --> 04:05:59.460]  Val: He came to...
[04:05:59.460 --> 04:06:01.460]  Val: We don't have this position in America,
[04:06:01.460 --> 04:06:02.460]  Val: but it's like a...
[04:06:02.460 --> 04:06:04.460]  Val: not speaker at the house.
[04:06:04.460 --> 04:06:05.460]  Val: It's like a...
[04:06:05.460 --> 04:06:07.460]  Val: It's not a attorney general,
[04:06:07.460 --> 04:06:10.460]  Val: but somewhere along the lines of a attorney general.
[04:06:10.460 --> 04:06:12.460]  Val: Um, he's got...
[04:06:12.460 --> 04:06:13.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:06:13.460 --> 04:06:15.460]  Val: That would be a very interesting to [unintelligible word].
[04:06:15.460 --> 04:06:16.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:06:16.460 --> 04:06:17.460]  Fed: I mean, and like I said,
[04:06:17.460 --> 04:06:18.460]  Fed: a lot of these things,
[04:06:18.460 --> 04:06:19.460]  Fed: I won't work.
[04:06:19.460 --> 04:06:20.460]  Fed: So, like, well,
[04:06:20.460 --> 04:06:21.460]  Fed: there's, I'll take the information,
[04:06:21.460 --> 04:06:22.460]  Fed: I'll give it to someone else,
[04:06:22.460 --> 04:06:23.460]  Fed: and see if they want to pursue it,
[04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:24.460]  Fed: and they'll probably talk to you or
[04:06:24.460 --> 04:06:25.460]  Fed: something like that.
[04:06:25.460 --> 04:06:26.460]  Val: Sure
[04:06:26.460 --> 04:06:27.460]  Val: Okay.
[04:06:27.460 --> 04:06:28.460]  Fed: Anyway, that's all good stuff.
[04:06:28.460 --> 04:06:30.460]  Fed: Um, I'd like to do...
[04:06:30.460 --> 04:06:31.460]  Fed: You can still have my number
[04:06:31.460 --> 04:06:32.460]  Fed: so you can always, you know,
[04:06:32.460 --> 04:06:33.460]  Fed: reach out to me
[04:06:33.460 --> 04:06:34.460]  Fed: if you forget something or...
[04:06:34.460 --> 04:06:35.460]  Val: Sure.
[04:06:35.460 --> 04:06:36.460]  Fed: You know, think of something later.
[04:06:36.460 --> 04:06:37.460]  Fed: Um...
[04:06:37.460 --> 04:06:38.460]  Val: Where does Marlowe go?
[04:06:38.460 --> 04:06:39.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:06:39.460 --> 04:06:40.460]  Fed: So, as far as Marlowe goes,
[04:06:40.460 --> 04:06:41.460]  Fed: like I said, I think
[04:06:41.460 --> 04:06:43.460]  Fed: our primary goal will still be to
[04:06:43.460 --> 04:06:44.460]  Fed: make sure you look good
[04:06:44.460 --> 04:06:45.460]  Fed: for the investigation.
[04:06:45.460 --> 04:06:46.460]  Fed: Right?
[04:06:46.460 --> 04:06:47.460]  Fed: Um...
[04:06:47.460 --> 04:06:48.460]  Val: But I can look good.
[04:06:48.460 --> 04:06:49.460]  Val: I don't know what you mean.
[04:06:49.460 --> 04:06:50.460]  Fed: Like, just make sure
[04:06:50.460 --> 04:06:51.460]  Fed: that the investigator sees
[04:06:51.460 --> 04:06:52.460]  Fed: everything that he or she
[04:06:52.460 --> 04:06:53.460]  Fed: is supposed to see,
[04:06:53.460 --> 04:06:55.460]  Fed: as far as making you
[04:06:55.460 --> 04:06:56.460]  Fed: and Marie, you know,
[04:06:56.460 --> 04:06:57.460]  Fed: good parents,
[04:06:57.460 --> 04:06:58.460]  Fed: and super, uh,
[04:06:58.460 --> 04:06:59.460]  Fed: an adult.
[04:06:59.460 --> 04:07:00.460]  Val: But my worry, though,
[04:07:00.460 --> 04:07:01.460]  Val: is that it's already
[04:07:01.460 --> 04:07:02.460]  Val: it's back again
[04:07:02.460 --> 04:07:03.460]  Val: just purposely.
[04:07:03.460 --> 04:07:04.460]  Val: I don't know why.
[04:07:04.460 --> 04:07:05.460]  Val: Again, I just feel like
[04:07:05.460 --> 04:07:06.460]  Val: you did it,
[04:07:06.460 --> 04:07:07.460]  Val: and take the time in it.
[04:07:07.460 --> 04:07:09.460]  Um, so even if we do show
[04:07:09.460 --> 04:07:10.460]  Val: our best stage
[04:07:10.460 --> 04:07:11.460]  Val: and we're the most perfect people
[04:07:11.460 --> 04:07:12.460]  Val: in the world,
[04:07:12.460 --> 04:07:13.460]  Val: you'll see it.
[04:07:13.460 --> 04:07:14.460]  Val: When you read the report,
[04:07:14.460 --> 04:07:15.460]  Val: you'll see what they did.
[04:07:15.460 --> 04:07:18.460]  Val: And now it can be...
[04:07:18.460 --> 04:07:19.460]  Val: I don't know how to fight that,
[04:07:19.460 --> 04:07:20.460]  Val: but it's something I don't know.
[04:07:20.460 --> 04:07:22.460]  Fed: It's tough nut to crack, too,
[04:07:22.460 --> 04:07:23.460]  Fed: because, like I said,
[04:07:23.460 --> 04:07:24.460]  Fed: I mean,
[04:07:24.460 --> 04:07:26.460]  Fed: what would you suggest
[04:07:26.460 --> 04:07:27.460]  Fed: that we do to influence
[04:07:27.460 --> 04:07:29.460]  Fed: what's already been written
[04:07:29.460 --> 04:07:30.460]  Fed: or how the proceedings
[04:07:30.460 --> 04:07:32.460]  Fed: will go on from here?
[04:07:32.460 --> 04:07:34.460]  Val: Well, I had, you know,
[04:07:34.460 --> 04:07:35.460]  Val: them admonished,
[04:07:35.460 --> 04:07:36.460]  Val: uh,
[04:07:36.460 --> 04:07:37.460]  Val: fucking thing dismissed
[04:07:37.460 --> 04:07:39.460]  Val: based on their terrible, uh,
[04:07:39.460 --> 04:07:40.460]  Val: obviously,
[04:07:40.460 --> 04:07:41.460]  Val: no due process
[04:07:41.460 --> 04:07:42.460]  Val: and misjudgment.
[04:07:42.460 --> 04:07:43.460]  Val: I wrote down a list
[04:07:43.460 --> 04:07:44.460]  Val: for you actually.
[04:07:44.460 --> 04:07:45.460]  Val: Um,
[04:07:45.460 --> 04:07:46.460]  Val: the lies
[04:07:46.460 --> 04:07:47.460]  Val: are caught in camera.
[04:07:47.460 --> 04:07:48.460]  Fed: Right.
[04:07:48.460 --> 04:07:49.460]  Fed: Versus what they wrote
[04:07:49.460 --> 04:07:50.460]  Fed: in the report.
[04:07:50.460 --> 04:07:51.460]  Fed: And it'll be good
[04:07:51.460 --> 04:07:52.460]  Fed: if you can collect all the evidence
[04:07:52.460 --> 04:07:53.460]  Fed: so that you can show that
[04:07:53.460 --> 04:07:54.460]  Fed: to the judge or whomever.
[04:07:54.460 --> 04:07:55.460]  Fed: Like,
[04:07:55.460 --> 04:07:56.460]  Fed: I assume you're going to fire...
[04:07:56.460 --> 04:07:57.460]  Fed: You fired your attorney
[04:07:57.460 --> 04:07:58.460]  Fed: to hire a new one.
[04:07:58.460 --> 04:07:59.460]  Fed: Like,
[04:07:59.460 --> 04:08:00.460]  Fed: you know,
[04:08:00.460 --> 04:08:01.460]  Fed: because it's probably good
[04:08:01.460 --> 04:08:02.460]  Fed: to get an attorney.
[04:08:02.460 --> 04:08:03.460]  Val: Because that was another thing
[04:08:03.460 --> 04:08:04.460]  Val: I wanted to gauge
[04:08:04.460 --> 04:08:05.460]  Val: what you could do
[04:08:05.460 --> 04:08:06.460]  Val: and do we need an attorney
[04:08:06.460 --> 04:08:07.460]  Val: based on what you could do?
[04:08:07.460 --> 04:08:08.460]  Fed: I mean,
[04:08:08.460 --> 04:08:09.460]  Fed: just my personal thing,
[04:08:09.460 --> 04:08:10.460]  Fed: I would probably want an attorney
[04:08:10.460 --> 04:08:11.460]  Fed: based on what I was in your situation.
[04:08:11.460 --> 04:08:12.460]  Fed: And I just, you know,
[04:08:12.460 --> 04:08:13.460]  Val: this is why people make money
[04:08:13.460 --> 04:08:14.460]  Val: [unintelligible]
[04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:15.460]  Fed: Right.
[04:08:15.460 --> 04:08:16.460]  Fed: And like,
[04:08:16.460 --> 04:08:17.460]  Fed: yeah,
[04:08:17.460 --> 04:08:18.460]  Fed: and if this is completely not
[04:08:18.460 --> 04:08:19.460]  Fed: F.B.I.
[04:08:19.460 --> 04:08:20.460]  Fed: but just having friends
[04:08:20.460 --> 04:08:21.460]  Fed: that have gone through the work
[04:08:21.460 --> 04:08:22.460]  Fed: that you want to have a lawyer.
[04:08:22.460 --> 04:08:23.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:08:23.460 --> 04:08:24.460]  Fed: I mean,
[04:08:24.460 --> 04:08:25.460]  Fed: you know,
[04:08:25.460 --> 04:08:26.460]  Fed: where you can have a lawyer
[04:08:26.460 --> 04:08:27.460]  Fed: and an attorney.
[04:08:27.460 --> 04:08:28.460]  Val: Marie told me that she wants me to be her lawyer [04:08:29.460 --> 04:08:30.460]  Val: I swear to God,
[04:08:30.460 --> 04:08:31.460]  Val: she said that.
[04:08:31.460 --> 04:08:32.460]  Fed: I mean,
[04:08:32.460 --> 04:08:33.460]  Fed: She loves you very much.
[04:08:33.460 --> 04:08:34.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:08:34.460 --> 04:08:35.460]  Fed: It's good that she trusts
[04:08:35.460 --> 04:08:36.460]  Fed: you that much.
[04:08:36.460 --> 04:08:37.460]  Fed: I've been...
[04:08:37.460 --> 04:08:38.460]  Val: Oh, no,
[04:08:38.460 --> 04:08:39.460]  Val: I love her too.
[04:08:39.460 --> 04:08:40.460]  Fed: There's a saying that
[04:08:40.460 --> 04:08:41.460]  Fed: a lawyer who represents himself
[04:08:41.460 --> 04:08:42.460]  Fed: has a a fool for a client.
[04:08:42.460 --> 04:08:43.460]  Val: I said,
[04:08:43.460 --> 04:08:44.460]  Val: if you're representing yourself
[04:08:44.460 --> 04:08:45.460]  Val: in America,
[04:08:45.460 --> 04:08:46.460]  Val: you're going to laugh at
[04:08:46.460 --> 04:08:47.460]  Val: the crazy person,
[04:08:47.460 --> 04:08:48.460]  Val: okay?
[04:08:48.460 --> 04:08:49.460]  Val: And if the boyfriend
[04:08:49.460 --> 04:08:50.460]  Val: represents the girlfriend,
[04:08:50.460 --> 04:08:51.460]  Val: it's even worse,
[04:08:51.460 --> 04:08:52.460]  Val: right?
[04:08:52.460 --> 04:08:53.460]  Fed: And maybe this will also
[04:08:53.460 --> 04:08:54.460]  Fed: help the young
[04:08:54.460 --> 04:08:55.460]  Fed: and the vulnerable.
[04:08:55.460 --> 04:08:56.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:08:56.460 --> 04:08:59.460]  Fed: And the court is a lot,
[04:08:59.460 --> 04:09:00.460]  Fed: a lot,
[04:09:00.460 --> 04:09:01.460]  Fed: a lot of emotions,
[04:09:01.460 --> 04:09:02.460]  Fed: right?
[04:09:02.460 --> 04:09:03.460]  Fed: Always remember
[04:09:03.460 --> 04:09:04.460]  Fed: that the judge
[04:09:04.460 --> 04:09:05.460]  Fed: cares about nothing
[04:09:05.460 --> 04:09:07.460]  Fed: except for the case.
[04:09:07.460 --> 04:09:08.460]  Val: Is it true, though?
[04:09:08.460 --> 04:09:09.460]  Fed: Absolutely.
[04:09:09.460 --> 04:09:11.460]  Fed: And think about it.
[04:09:11.460 --> 04:09:12.460]  Fed: Think about it
[04:09:12.460 --> 04:09:14.460]  Fed: from this perspective.
[04:09:14.460 --> 04:09:15.460]  Fed: Their whole purpose
[04:09:15.460 --> 04:09:16.460]  Fed: for existing
[04:09:16.460 --> 04:09:17.460]  Fed: is to ensure
[04:09:17.460 --> 04:09:18.460]  Fed: the safety of children.
[04:09:18.460 --> 04:09:19.460]  Val: That's what I want to
[04:09:19.460 --> 04:09:20.460]  Val: believe is true,
[04:09:20.460 --> 04:09:21.460]  Val: but that's not what I've seen.
[04:09:21.460 --> 04:09:22.460]  Val: I've seen only
[04:09:22.460 --> 04:09:23.460]  Val: people acting their
[04:09:23.460 --> 04:09:24.460]  Val: own self-interest.
[04:09:24.460 --> 04:09:25.460]  Val: I haven't seen anything
[04:09:25.460 --> 04:09:26.460]  Val: else like that
[04:09:26.460 --> 04:09:27.460]  Val: in this system.
[04:09:27.460 --> 04:09:28.460]  Fed: Well,
[04:09:28.460 --> 04:09:29.460]  Fed: when you talk about
[04:09:29.460 --> 04:09:30.460]  Fed: the lack of
[04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:31.460]  Fed: due process in it,
[04:09:31.460 --> 04:09:32.460]  Fed: something,
[04:09:32.460 --> 04:09:33.460]  Fed: maybe some things are falling
[04:09:33.460 --> 04:09:34.460]  Fed: apart here,
[04:09:34.460 --> 04:09:35.460]  Fed: always come back
[04:09:35.460 --> 04:09:36.460]  Fed: to what the judge
[04:09:36.460 --> 04:09:38.460]  Fed: is going to ask
[04:09:38.460 --> 04:09:40.460]  Fed: and answer those questions
[04:09:40.460 --> 04:09:41.460]  Fed: for him.
[04:09:41.460 --> 04:09:43.460]  Fed: Does that make sense?
[04:09:43.460 --> 04:09:45.460]  Fed: Because one side is going to
[04:09:45.460 --> 04:09:46.460]  Fed: say,
[04:09:46.460 --> 04:09:47.460]  Fed: oh, this is best for the kids.
[04:09:47.460 --> 04:09:48.460]  Fed: And your argument says,
[04:09:48.460 --> 04:09:49.460]  Fed: this has to be
[04:09:49.460 --> 04:09:50.460]  Fed: best for the kids.
[04:09:50.460 --> 04:09:51.460]  Fed: That's what we're talking
[04:09:51.460 --> 04:09:52.460]  Fed: about.
[04:09:52.460 --> 04:09:53.460]  Fed: We got to make you
[04:09:53.460 --> 04:09:54.460]  Fed: look better.
[04:09:54.460 --> 04:09:55.460]  Fed: And you've got to make
[04:09:55.460 --> 04:09:56.460]  Fed: yourself look better
[04:09:56.460 --> 04:09:57.460]  Fed: than there's nothing
[04:09:57.460 --> 04:09:58.460]  Fed: left.
[04:09:58.460 --> 04:09:59.460]  Fed: Because then the judge
[04:09:59.460 --> 04:10:00.460]  Fed: is going to wait until
[04:10:00.460 --> 04:10:01.460]  Fed: and say,
[04:10:01.460 --> 04:10:02.460]  Fed: this is a better place.
[04:10:02.460 --> 04:10:03.460]  Val: Was it the experienced
[04:10:03.460 --> 04:10:04.460]  Val: judged like,
[04:10:04.460 --> 04:10:05.460]  Val: is it her
[04:10:05.460 --> 04:10:06.460]  Val: dominion is to
[04:10:06.460 --> 04:10:07.460]  Val: know the difference
[04:10:07.460 --> 04:10:08.460]  Val: between the lies
[04:10:08.460 --> 04:10:09.460]  Val: and the fabrications.
[04:10:09.460 --> 04:10:10.460]  Val: To know the difference
[04:10:10.460 --> 04:10:11.460]  Val: between a crazy person
[04:10:11.460 --> 04:10:12.460]  Val: that's just calling
[04:10:12.460 --> 04:10:13.460]  Val: every day to
[04:10:13.460 --> 04:10:14.460]  Val: piss somebody off
[04:10:14.460 --> 04:10:15.460]  Val: versus a person
[04:10:15.460 --> 04:10:16.460]  Val: that's concerned.
[04:10:16.460 --> 04:10:17.460]  Fed: And how does the judge
[04:10:17.460 --> 04:10:18.460]  Fed: weigh that
[04:10:18.460 --> 04:10:19.460]  Fed: in front of them?
[04:10:19.460 --> 04:10:20.460]  Fed: To weigh that with
[04:10:20.460 --> 04:10:21.460]  Fed: what the judge
[04:10:21.460 --> 04:10:22.460]  Fed: needed to lay it out
[04:10:22.460 --> 04:10:23.460]  Fed: in front of them?
[04:10:23.460 --> 04:10:24.460]  Fed: What's the
[04:10:24.460 --> 04:10:25.460]  Fed: best kind of evidence
[04:10:25.460 --> 04:10:26.460]  Fed: in front of them?
[04:10:26.460 --> 04:10:27.460]  Fed: OK.
[04:10:27.460 --> 04:10:28.460]  Fed: So you need
[04:10:28.460 --> 04:10:29.460]  Fed: to, like,
[04:10:29.460 --> 04:10:30.460]  Fed: get strong
[04:10:30.460 --> 04:10:31.460]  Fed: and, again,
[04:10:31.460 --> 04:10:32.460]  Fed: you know,
[04:10:32.460 --> 04:10:33.460]  Fed: those are the lawyers
[04:10:33.460 --> 04:10:34.460]  Fed: who, like,
[04:10:34.460 --> 04:10:35.460]  Fed: you need to
[04:10:35.460 --> 04:10:36.460]  Fed: try to organize
[04:10:36.460 --> 04:10:37.460]  Fed: your response
[04:10:37.460 --> 04:10:38.460]  Fed: to those, like,
[04:10:38.460 --> 04:10:39.460]  Fed: rebuttals
[04:10:39.460 --> 04:10:40.460]  Fed: because they're
[04:10:40.460 --> 04:10:41.460]  Fed: representing the facts
[04:10:41.460 --> 04:10:42.460]  Fed: to the judge, not.
[04:10:42.460 --> 04:10:43.460]  Fed: I mean, you could, too.
[04:10:43.460 --> 04:10:44.460]  Val: No, you're right.
[04:10:44.460 --> 04:10:45.460]  Val: We're going to get lawyers.
[04:10:45.460 --> 04:10:46.460]  Fed: Yeah, OK.
[04:10:46.460 --> 04:10:47.460]  Val: But thank you, yeah.
[04:10:47.460 --> 04:10:48.460]  Val: I'm worried because
[04:10:48.460 --> 04:10:49.460]  Val: I looked up this judge
[04:10:49.460 --> 04:10:50.460]  Val: and her reviews were
[04:10:50.460 --> 04:10:51.460]  Val: not good.
[04:10:51.460 --> 04:10:52.460]  Val: And I don't expect her
[04:10:52.460 --> 04:10:53.460]  Val: to have any,
[04:10:53.460 --> 04:10:54.460]  Val: you know,
[04:10:54.460 --> 04:10:55.460]  Val: these are the
[04:10:55.460 --> 04:10:56.460]  Val: things.
[04:10:56.460 --> 04:10:57.460]  Val: But this was
[04:10:57.460 --> 04:10:58.460]  Val: 100% bad.
[04:10:58.460 --> 04:10:59.460]  Val: There was nothing good.
[04:10:59.460 --> 04:11:00.460]  Fed: I guess the people that
[04:11:00.460 --> 04:11:01.460]  Fed: put these are more
[04:11:01.460 --> 04:11:02.460]  Fed: motivated to write this.
[04:11:03.460 --> 04:11:04.460]  Val: I know that, too.
[04:11:04.460 --> 04:11:05.460]  Val: Like, I've read
[04:11:05.460 --> 04:11:06.460]  Val: through the lines.
[04:11:06.460 --> 04:11:07.460]  Val: I've been one
[04:11:07.460 --> 04:11:08.460]  Val: through lots of cases,
[04:11:08.460 --> 04:11:09.460]  Val: but I didn't see anybody say
[04:11:09.460 --> 04:11:10.460]  Val: she did great by me
[04:11:10.460 --> 04:11:11.460]  Val: not one person.
[04:11:11.460 --> 04:11:12.460]  Val: I only see
[04:11:12.460 --> 04:11:13.460]  Val: she's married to another
[04:11:13.460 --> 04:11:15.460]  Val: judge in that same court.
[04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:16.460]  Val: I see he was
[04:11:16.460 --> 04:11:17.460]  Val: admonished for his
[04:11:17.460 --> 04:11:18.460]  Val: handling of the situation.
[04:11:18.460 --> 04:11:19.460]  Val: She was admonished for this.
[04:11:19.460 --> 04:11:20.460]  Val: They were,
[04:11:20.460 --> 04:11:21.460]  Val: they were
[04:11:21.460 --> 04:11:22.460]  Val: severe.
[04:11:22.460 --> 04:11:23.460]  Val: Like, I'm
[04:11:23.460 --> 04:11:24.460]  Val: I'm
[04:11:24.460 --> 04:11:25.460]  Fed: I was focused on
[04:11:25.460 --> 04:11:26.460]  Fed: what's successful,
[04:11:26.460 --> 04:11:27.460]  Fed: the people that are successful,
[04:11:27.460 --> 04:11:28.460]  Fed: right?
[04:11:28.460 --> 04:11:29.460]  Fed: How were they successful?
[04:11:29.460 --> 04:11:31.460]  Fed: They presented
[04:11:31.460 --> 04:11:32.460]  Fed: evidence that
[04:11:32.460 --> 04:11:33.460]  Fed: was more favorable
[04:11:33.460 --> 04:11:34.460]  Fed: for each child.
[04:11:34.460 --> 04:11:35.460]  Fed: Oh.
[04:11:36.460 --> 04:11:37.460]  Fed: That's it.
[04:11:37.460 --> 04:11:39.460]  Fed: It's very narrow,
[04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:40.460]  Fed: and it's really narrow.
[04:11:40.460 --> 04:11:41.460]  Val: But I do that.
[04:11:41.460 --> 04:11:42.460]  Val: That's why I'm here.
[04:11:42.460 --> 04:11:43.460]  Val: That's why I'm frustrated.
[04:11:43.460 --> 04:11:44.460]  Val: Because this is what
[04:11:44.460 --> 04:11:45.460]  Val: I do.
[04:11:45.460 --> 04:11:46.460]  Fed: Well, that's what
[04:11:46.460 --> 04:11:47.460]  Fed: you need to give attorney.
[04:11:47.460 --> 04:11:48.460]  Val: It's clear.
[04:11:48.460 --> 04:11:49.460]  Val: It's clear.
[04:11:49.460 --> 04:11:50.460]  Val: If you walk in the room,
[04:11:50.460 --> 04:11:51.460]  Val: if you guys walk in there,
[04:11:51.460 --> 04:11:52.460]  Val: anybody who's walked
[04:11:52.460 --> 04:11:53.460]  Val: into my life
[04:11:53.460 --> 04:11:55.460]  Val: and Marie's to Steve,
[04:11:55.460 --> 04:11:56.460]  Val: it's night and day.
[04:11:56.460 --> 04:11:57.460]  Val: Obviously,
[04:11:57.460 --> 04:11:58.460]  Val: Marlowe belongs with us.
[04:11:58.460 --> 04:11:59.460]  Val: It's,
[04:11:59.460 --> 04:12:00.460]  Val: I'm not saying that this is
[04:12:00.460 --> 04:12:01.460]  Val: subjectively.
[04:12:01.460 --> 04:12:02.460]  Val: I mean, I am,
[04:12:02.460 --> 04:12:03.460]  Val: but it's clear.
[04:12:03.460 --> 04:12:04.460]  Val: But to have these
[04:12:04.460 --> 04:12:05.460]  Val: these people do that
[04:12:05.460 --> 04:12:07.460]  Val: and come up with
[04:12:07.460 --> 04:12:08.460]  Val: this,
[04:12:08.460 --> 04:12:09.460]  Val: when you read it,
[04:12:09.460 --> 04:12:10.460]  Val: you'll see.
[04:12:10.460 --> 04:12:11.460]  Val: It's,
[04:12:11.460 --> 04:12:12.460]  Val: that scares me
[04:12:12.460 --> 04:12:13.460]  Val: because that shows
[04:12:13.460 --> 04:12:14.460]  Val: that someone is
[04:12:14.460 --> 04:12:15.460]  Val: something else is going on.
[04:12:15.460 --> 04:12:16.460]  Val: There's something else
[04:12:16.460 --> 04:12:17.460]  Val: I don't know.
[04:12:17.460 --> 04:12:18.460]  Val: I don't know how to gauge it.
[04:12:18.460 --> 04:12:19.460]  Val: I don't know how to weigh it.
[04:12:19.460 --> 04:12:20.460]  Val: I don't know what it is
[04:12:20.460 --> 04:12:21.460]  Val: and scaring me.
[04:12:23.460 --> 04:12:24.460]  Val: It's not
[04:12:24.460 --> 04:12:25.460]  Val: how it should be.
[04:12:25.460 --> 04:12:26.460]  Val: You know,
[04:12:26.460 --> 04:12:27.460]  Val: it's how it should be.
[04:12:27.460 --> 04:12:28.460]  Val: That's the problem.
[04:12:28.460 --> 04:12:29.460]  Fed: I told you earlier.
[04:12:29.460 --> 04:12:30.460]  Fed: We're honest.
[04:12:30.460 --> 04:12:31.460]  Fed: I'll be honest with you now.
[04:12:31.460 --> 04:12:32.460]  Fed: It's just scary.
[04:12:32.460 --> 04:12:34.460]  Fed: It's just scary things.
[04:12:34.460 --> 04:12:35.460]  Fed: That's,
[04:12:35.460 --> 04:12:37.460]  Fed: that's Marie's child
[04:12:37.460 --> 04:12:38.460]  Fed: but it's also yours.
[04:12:38.460 --> 04:12:39.460]  Fed: So,
[04:12:39.460 --> 04:12:41.460]  Fed: you've got to focus on those things.
[04:12:41.460 --> 04:12:42.460]  Fed: And I'll,
[04:12:42.460 --> 04:12:43.460]  Fed: and I'll give you something.
[04:12:43.460 --> 04:12:44.460]  Fed: I'm not an attorney
[04:12:44.460 --> 04:12:45.460]  Fed: but hearing this,
[04:12:45.460 --> 04:12:47.460]  Fed: some of what I picked up on
[04:12:47.460 --> 04:12:49.460]  Fed: is an allegation of a bea--
[04:12:49.460 --> 04:12:50.460]  Fed: of a bruise.
[04:12:50.460 --> 04:12:51.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:12:51.460 --> 04:12:52.460]  Val: A black eye.
[04:12:52.460 --> 04:12:53.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:12:53.460 --> 04:12:54.460]  Fed: Don't be mad about the allegation.
[04:12:54.460 --> 04:12:55.460]  Fed: How do you disprove it?
[04:12:55.460 --> 04:12:56.460]  Val: I know,
[04:12:56.460 --> 04:12:57.460]  Val: but you can't,
[04:12:57.460 --> 04:12:58.460]  Val: but that's why they picked the shit
[04:12:58.460 --> 04:12:59.460]  Val: that's hard to disprove.
[04:12:59.460 --> 04:13:00.460]  Val: How do I go and disprove your ph--?
[04:13:00.460 --> 04:13:01.460]  Val: We have photos from the game.
[04:13:01.460 --> 04:13:02.460]  Fed: Well,
[04:13:02.460 --> 04:13:03.460]  Fed: you said you also had a video crew
[04:13:03.460 --> 04:13:04.460]  Fed: that was following you.
[04:13:04.460 --> 04:13:05.460]  Val: We have a video crew
[04:13:05.460 --> 04:13:06.460]  Val: and we have photos of Marlowe
[04:13:06.460 --> 04:13:07.460]  Val: from that day.
[04:13:07.460 --> 04:13:08.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:13:08.460 --> 04:13:09.460]  Fed: So,
[04:13:09.460 --> 04:13:10.460]  Val: so then someone says,
[04:13:10.460 --> 04:13:11.460]  Fed: oh, well,
[04:13:11.460 --> 04:13:12.460]  Fed: you need to produce those
[04:13:12.460 --> 04:13:14.460]  Fed: to show that that allegation is false.
[04:13:14.460 --> 04:13:16.460]  Fed: You just have to focus on that.
[04:13:16.460 --> 04:13:17.460]  Fed: Does that make sense?
[04:13:17.460 --> 04:13:18.460]  Val: That's,
[04:13:18.460 --> 04:13:19.460]  Val: yeah,
[04:13:19.460 --> 04:13:20.460]  Val: I mean,
[04:13:20.460 --> 04:13:21.460]  Val: like it's easy.
[04:13:21.460 --> 04:13:22.460]  Val: And you need to.
[04:13:22.460 --> 04:13:23.460]  Val: It sounds easy.
[04:13:23.460 --> 04:13:24.460]  Val: I can do that
[04:13:24.460 --> 04:13:25.460]  Val: but they can only say
[04:13:25.460 --> 04:13:26.460]  Val: something else.
[04:13:26.460 --> 04:13:27.460]  Val: How do you disprove Marlowe
[04:13:27.460 --> 04:13:28.460]  Val: going through the trash?
[04:13:28.460 --> 04:13:29.460]  Val: Scouraging [sic] for food?
[04:13:29.460 --> 04:13:30.460]  Val: How do I disprove that?
[04:13:30.460 --> 04:13:31.460]  Val: At 1 a.m.,
[04:13:31.460 --> 04:13:32.460]  Val: she says,
[04:13:32.460 --> 04:13:33.460]  Val: he's going through the trash
[04:13:33.460 --> 04:13:34.460]  Val: alone,
[04:13:34.460 --> 04:13:35.460]  Val: trying to get food out of
[04:13:35.460 --> 04:13:36.460]  Val: garbage dumpsters.
[04:13:36.460 --> 04:13:37.460]  Val: Marlowe,
[04:13:37.460 --> 04:13:38.460]  Val: an eight-year-old.
[04:13:38.460 --> 04:13:39.460]  Val: How do I disprove that?
[04:13:39.460 --> 04:13:40.460]  Val: And that's,
[04:13:40.460 --> 04:13:41.460]  Val: that's the thing.
[04:13:41.460 --> 04:13:42.460]  Val: You can't disprove it.
[04:13:42.460 --> 04:13:43.460]  Val: You can't prove a negative, right?
[04:13:43.460 --> 04:13:44.460]  Val: You can't disprove.
[04:13:44.460 --> 04:13:45.460]  Val: Go disprove it.
[04:13:45.460 --> 04:13:46.460]  Val: You're not,
[04:13:46.460 --> 04:13:47.460]  Val: tell me,
[04:13:47.460 --> 04:13:48.460]  Val: prove me you're not guilty.
[04:13:48.460 --> 04:13:49.460]  Fed: A little Scarlet letter?
[04:13:49.460 --> 04:13:50.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:13:50.460 --> 04:13:51.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:13:51.460 --> 04:13:52.460]  Val: That's,
[04:13:52.460 --> 04:13:53.460]  Val: that's,
[04:13:53.460 --> 04:13:54.460]  Val: that's,
[04:13:54.460 --> 04:13:55.460]  Fed: that's what I'm trying to say.
[04:13:55.460 --> 04:13:56.460]  Fed: I'm trying to go to the
[04:13:56.460 --> 04:13:57.460]  Fed: anecdotally talk to these the lawyers.
[04:13:57.460 --> 04:13:58.460]  Fed: Like,
[04:13:58.460 --> 04:13:59.460]  Fed: they've seen it all.
[04:13:59.460 --> 04:14:00.460]  Fed: They've seen,
[04:14:00.460 --> 04:14:01.460]  Fed: you know,
[04:14:01.460 --> 04:14:02.460]  Fed: they've probably seen
[04:14:02.460 --> 04:14:03.460]  Fed: elements of your story before
[04:14:03.460 --> 04:14:04.460]  Fed: and they know what,
[04:14:04.460 --> 04:14:05.460]  Fed: they hopefully they will know
[04:14:05.460 --> 04:14:08.460]  Fed: what a good response to those
[04:14:08.460 --> 04:14:09.460]  Fed: things are.
[04:14:09.460 --> 04:14:10.460]  Fed: And another thing,
[04:14:10.460 --> 04:14:11.460]  Fed: it's not just being a good,
[04:14:11.460 --> 04:14:12.460]  Fed: like,
[04:14:12.460 --> 04:14:13.460]  Fed: you can be a vicious,
[04:14:13.460 --> 04:14:14.460]  Fed: hard-going lawyer,
[04:14:14.460 --> 04:14:15.460]  Fed: but if you don't understand
[04:14:15.460 --> 04:14:16.460]  Fed: and you don't understand
[04:14:16.460 --> 04:14:17.460]  Fed: the process,
[04:14:17.460 --> 04:14:18.460]  Fed: how are you going to be
[04:14:18.460 --> 04:14:19.460]  Fed: at the other side,
[04:14:19.460 --> 04:14:20.460]  Fed: whether you want or not?
[04:14:20.460 --> 04:14:21.460]  Val: Yes.
[04:14:21.460 --> 04:14:22.460]  Fed: You have to understand
[04:14:22.460 --> 04:14:22.960]  Val: Yes.
[04:14:22.960 --> 04:14:24.960]  Fed: You have to understand your situation.
[04:14:24.960 --> 04:14:25.460]  Val: We don't.
[04:14:25.460 --> 04:14:25.960]  Val: We don't.
[04:14:25.960 --> 04:14:26.960]  Val: He didn't tell us anything.
[04:14:26.960 --> 04:14:29.960]  Val: He didn't want that job to be done.
[04:14:29.960 --> 04:14:31.960]  Val: He was using us for his own case.
[04:14:31.960 --> 04:14:33.460]  Fed: Can you see that's pretty tricky?
[04:14:33.460 --> 04:14:36.960]  Fed: I can't tell you what to do with your attorney to fire that and get a new one or what kind
[04:14:36.960 --> 04:14:37.460]  Fed: of attorney.
[04:14:37.460 --> 04:14:44.460]  Fed: I just can't do that because I think I'm starting to be in a certain spot as any human would
[04:14:44.460 --> 04:14:45.960]  Fed: just do any process.
[04:14:45.960 --> 04:14:48.960]  Fed: You have to understand the other side of it.
[04:14:48.960 --> 04:14:49.460]  Val: I did.
[04:14:49.460 --> 04:14:54.460]  Val: I'm telling you, we accidentally put ourselves in the middle of another case.
[04:14:54.460 --> 04:14:57.460]  Val: We're being used for someone else's case.
[04:14:57.460 --> 04:15:04.460]  Val: The lawyer we found, the woman that we recall, wants us to help her with her bigger case.
[04:15:04.460 --> 04:15:05.960]  Val: That's what we're used for.
[04:15:05.960 --> 04:15:08.460]  Val: So our lawyer was not working our best interest.
[04:15:08.460 --> 04:15:11.460]  Val: He's working for his best interest and her best interest.
[04:15:11.460 --> 04:15:12.460]  Val: That's the problem.
[04:15:12.460 --> 04:15:21.460]  Val: And that's why I'm fucking, that woman, the judge, knows that because he's been working
[04:15:21.460 --> 04:15:24.460]  Val: in that group for 30, 20 years.
[04:15:24.460 --> 04:15:25.460]  Val: Everyone knows each other.
[04:15:25.460 --> 04:15:26.460]  Val: It's so incestual down there.
[04:15:26.460 --> 04:15:30.460]  Val: She knows that, but she's still accepted that what she did.
[04:15:30.460 --> 04:15:31.460]  Val: And that scares me too.
[04:15:31.460 --> 04:15:32.460]  Val: [unintelligible] judge
[04:15:32.460 --> 04:15:38.460]  Val: The whole thing used to be, you have to get paternal affairs down there and fucking clean this place up because something's wrong here.
[04:15:38.460 --> 04:15:40.460]  Val: And these are children.
[04:15:40.460 --> 04:15:41.460]  Val: It's fucked up.
[04:15:41.460 --> 04:15:43.460]  Val: You know, they think they're above the law now.
[04:15:43.460 --> 04:15:44.460]  Val: These people are down there.
[04:15:44.460 --> 04:15:45.460]  Val: It's fucked up.
[04:15:45.460 --> 04:15:46.460]  Val: The egos are so big.
[04:15:46.460 --> 04:15:47.460]  Val: Nope.
[04:15:47.460 --> 04:15:51.460]  Val: Like, I've seen big egos, like bankers, like billionaires.
[04:15:51.460 --> 04:15:54.460]  Val: They don't say anything against these lawyers and the judges.
[04:15:54.460 --> 04:15:55.460]  Val: It's crazy.
[04:15:55.460 --> 04:15:57.460]  Fed: But we [???] have your back.
[04:15:57.460 --> 04:15:59.460]  Fed: We're going to have your case.
[04:15:59.460 --> 04:16:02.460]  Val: That's what I'm telling you.
[04:16:02.460 --> 04:16:10.460]  Val: For example, he said, clear as day in writing, I am counsel for Val Broeksmit.
[04:16:10.460 --> 04:16:11.460]  Val: Marie calls him last night.
[04:16:11.460 --> 04:16:12.460]  Val: We record the conversation.
[04:16:12.460 --> 04:16:13.460]  Val: He doesn't know.
[04:16:13.460 --> 04:16:18.460]  Val: Why didn't you say to Tim and Lucy that you were Vals counsel?
[04:16:18.460 --> 04:16:19.460]  Val: Oh fucking Val.
[04:16:19.460 --> 04:16:20.460]  Val: Don't listen to him.
[04:16:20.460 --> 04:16:22.460]  Val: He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[04:16:22.460 --> 04:16:23.460]  Val: Vals an idiot.
[04:16:23.460 --> 04:16:24.460]  Val: Val's a bully.
[04:16:24.460 --> 04:16:25.460]  Val: He's going to ruin you.
[04:16:25.460 --> 04:16:26.460]  Val: He's going to screw up your case.
[04:16:26.460 --> 04:16:27.460]  Val: You need to drop Val.
[04:16:27.460 --> 04:16:29.460]  Val: No, but you didn't answer my question.
[04:16:29.460 --> 04:16:31.460]  Val: How is it that you said this?
[04:16:31.460 --> 04:16:33.460]  Val: I mean, it's right here in the email.
[04:16:33.460 --> 04:16:34.460]  Val: I'm looking at it.
[04:16:34.460 --> 04:16:35.460]  Val: I did not say that, Marie.
[04:16:35.460 --> 04:16:36.460]  Val: I said, I'm your counsel.
[04:16:36.460 --> 04:16:37.460]  Val: I'm Marie's counsel.
[04:16:37.460 --> 04:16:38.460]  Val: And I'm here to help.
[04:16:38.460 --> 04:16:39.460]  Val: That's it.
[04:16:39.460 --> 04:16:40.460]  Val: You want to talk about this?
[04:16:40.460 --> 04:16:41.460]  Val: You want to talk about going with Val?
[04:16:41.460 --> 04:16:42.460]  Val: I can walk away anytime.
[04:16:42.460 --> 04:16:45.460]  Val: I don't need this case for 30 minutes of this.
[04:16:45.460 --> 04:16:46.460]  Val: All right.
[04:16:46.460 --> 04:16:48.460]  Val: He was denying reality.
[04:16:48.460 --> 04:16:49.460]  Val: Okay.
[04:16:49.460 --> 04:16:50.460]  Val: That's scary.
[04:16:50.460 --> 04:16:51.460]  Fed: That's your attorney.
[04:16:51.460 --> 04:16:52.460]  Val: That was our attorney.
[04:16:52.460 --> 04:16:53.460]  Val: That's my attorney.
[04:16:53.460 --> 04:16:54.460]  Fed: That's your attorney.
[04:16:54.460 --> 04:16:57.460]  Val: Yeah, but that's also the relationship with the judge.
[04:16:57.460 --> 04:16:58.460]  Val: That's what I'm saying.
[04:16:58.460 --> 04:17:00.460]  Val: It's like that, don't it?
[04:17:00.460 --> 04:17:03.460]  Fed: It seems like, correct me if I'm wrong,
[04:17:03.460 --> 04:17:06.460]  Fed: Your frustration is that you believe that there's corruption at the judicial level.
[04:17:06.460 --> 04:17:07.460]  Fed: Like the judge is corrupt.
[04:17:07.460 --> 04:17:08.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:17:08.460 --> 04:17:09.460]  Fed: That's the problem.
[04:17:09.460 --> 04:17:10.460]  Val: Absolutely.
[04:17:10.460 --> 04:17:11.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:17:11.460 --> 04:17:12.460]  Val: So, yeah.
[04:17:12.460 --> 04:17:13.460]  Val: No experience with this at all.
[04:17:13.460 --> 04:17:15.460]  Val: I'm just telling you, my experience with this is where I talk.
[04:17:15.460 --> 04:17:19.460]  Fed: Well, it's because nothing we can tell you about the process is going to make any sense
[04:17:19.460 --> 04:17:21.460]  Fed: if you don't trust the system, right?
[04:17:21.460 --> 04:17:24.460]  Fed: Because right now you don't trust the system because you think the judge is corrupt, right?
[04:17:24.460 --> 04:17:27.460]  Fed: So, then the question is, what is our solution?
[04:17:27.460 --> 04:17:28.460]  Fed: We can't just correct the problem, right?
[04:17:28.460 --> 04:17:29.460]  Fed: That's right.
[04:17:29.460 --> 04:17:30.460]  Fed: We have to find a solution to it.
[04:17:30.460 --> 04:17:33.460]  Val: And I cannot be, I can't be an asshole and just do it for myself.
[04:17:33.460 --> 04:17:35.460]  Val: And that's why I say, well, there's other people's children.
[04:17:35.460 --> 04:17:39.460]  Val: So, if I read it online about their kids being taken away from them, we can't...
[04:17:39.460 --> 04:17:40.460]  Fed: Hold on.
[04:17:40.460 --> 04:17:41.460]  Fed: Hold on.
[04:17:41.460 --> 04:17:42.460]  Fed: Right?
[04:17:42.460 --> 04:17:46.460]  Fed: So, like, we can talk all day with you about how to help you.
[04:17:46.460 --> 04:17:51.460]  Fed: But if you don't trust the judge, nothing that we can say is going to make any difference, right?
[04:17:51.460 --> 04:17:57.460]  Fed: So, as far as being a corrupt judge, like if you wanted us to investigate the judge for
[04:17:57.460 --> 04:18:01.460]  Fed: public corruption or something like that, that's a whole other case, a whole other issue that
[04:18:01.460 --> 04:18:04.460]  Fed: we would have to resolve that would take years.
[04:18:04.460 --> 04:18:06.460]  Fed: It's not going to help you.
[04:18:06.460 --> 04:18:08.460]  Val: So, how do you navigate it?
[04:18:08.460 --> 04:18:09.460]  Fed: Right, right.
[04:18:09.460 --> 04:18:14.460]  Fed: So, the best advice I can give you is that, as unfair as it sounds right now, there seems
[04:18:14.460 --> 04:18:17.460]  Fed: like there's a lot of things that are going on with the judge.
[04:18:17.460 --> 04:18:19.460]  Fed: What we've talked about is true.
[04:18:19.460 --> 04:18:22.460]  Fed: The judges do have a kid that interests that hand.
[04:18:22.460 --> 04:18:27.460]  Fed: Like, you can form a whole conspiracy about why this judge wants to take Marlowe away from
[04:18:27.460 --> 04:18:28.460]  Fed: you.
[04:18:28.460 --> 04:18:29.460]  Fed: And at the end of the day it's about Marlowe.
[04:18:29.460 --> 04:18:32.460]  Fed: And that's what we have to focus on, right?
[04:18:32.460 --> 04:18:36.460]  Fed: Because if the judge is trying to, you know, screw someone over...
[04:18:36.460 --> 04:18:38.460]  Val: You're going back to the same...
[04:18:38.460 --> 04:18:44.460]  Fed: Okay, so, what's our solution going to be for a corrupt judge that is just out to fuck
[04:18:44.460 --> 04:18:45.460]  Fed: everyone?
[04:18:45.460 --> 04:18:46.460]  Val: That's not what I'm saying.
[04:18:46.460 --> 04:18:47.460]  Val: I'm not saying...
[04:18:47.460 --> 04:18:49.460]  Val: Is that how it comes off?
[04:18:49.460 --> 04:18:53.460]  Val: Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like that.
[04:18:53.460 --> 04:19:02.460]  Val: I mean, in this specific case, we accidentally found a lawyer that has an agenda to get another
[04:19:02.460 --> 04:19:03.460]  Val: guy, right?
[04:19:03.460 --> 04:19:08.460]  Val: We fell into this trap, into a circle of friends, they're like a cabal, they're very close to
[04:19:08.460 --> 04:19:10.460]  Val: each other, they're married to each other for fuck's sake.
[04:19:10.460 --> 04:19:13.460]  Val: They know each other very well for 20 plus years.
[04:19:13.460 --> 04:19:17.460]  Val: They feel like they're above the law, they have their own law structure there.
[04:19:17.460 --> 04:19:20.460]  Val: They decide what happens, not the law.
[04:19:20.460 --> 04:19:27.460]  Val: And we saw accidentally the triple whammy now into this little cabal and we became a
[04:19:27.460 --> 04:19:29.460]  Val: tool all of a sudden.
[04:19:29.460 --> 04:19:33.460]  Val: Now, when we drop this guy, he's not going to be happy about that.
[04:19:33.460 --> 04:19:35.460]  Val: He knows the judge very well.
[04:19:35.460 --> 04:19:37.460]  Val: Very fucking well, they're very close.
[04:19:37.460 --> 04:19:38.460]  Val: You can see it in the...
[04:19:38.460 --> 04:19:40.460]  Val: You know, they say don't record...
[04:19:40.460 --> 04:19:41.460]  Val: You know how they record this shit?
[04:19:41.460 --> 04:19:42.460]  Val: The trials?
[04:19:42.460 --> 04:19:44.460]  Val: They fucking record everything.
[04:19:44.460 --> 04:19:51.460]  Val: You know, and so we went through it last night and heard again how he did not defend us.
[04:19:51.460 --> 04:19:53.460]  Val: I mean, I don't want to get too much into it.
[04:19:53.460 --> 04:19:58.460]  Val: We actively tried to get him out of the room knowing that Marie was lying saying Val's out of
[04:19:58.460 --> 04:19:59.460]  Val: the room, don't worry about it.
[04:19:59.460 --> 04:20:02.460]  Val: You know Marie, you really have to get him out of the room.
[04:20:02.460 --> 04:20:04.460]  Val: And that's our lawyer throwing us under the bus.
[04:20:04.460 --> 04:20:06.460]  Val: And the judge knew it.
[04:20:06.460 --> 04:20:08.460]  Val: I don't know how to describe it.
[04:20:08.460 --> 04:20:12.460]  Fed: You think if you had a new lawyer it would change the situation?
[04:20:12.460 --> 04:20:13.460]  Val: No.
[04:20:14.460 --> 04:20:17.460]  Fed: But that's a solution, I think, on the table right now.
[04:20:17.460 --> 04:20:18.460]  Val: I don't know.
[04:20:18.460 --> 04:20:21.460]  Val: There might be a good guy, like a stand-up guy.
[04:20:21.460 --> 04:20:24.460]  Val: And he's told us it's a whole other system down there.
[04:20:24.460 --> 04:20:28.460]  Val: You need to get a lawyer that's court ordered that knows that system.
[04:20:28.460 --> 04:20:29.460]  Val: You know, that's your best bet.
[04:20:29.460 --> 04:20:32.460]  Val: I can get you an expensive lawyer that can do it for you, too.
[04:20:32.460 --> 04:20:35.460]  Val: But he's not going to be as good as the people that are in that court.
[04:20:35.460 --> 04:20:37.460]  Val: And that means that it is corrupt.
[04:20:37.460 --> 04:20:38.460]  Val: They do it amongst each other.
[04:20:38.460 --> 04:20:42.460]  Val: They have their own star chambers, certain things.
[04:20:42.460 --> 04:20:47.460]  Val: And so it's Saba who's creating fucking evidence, and she's a social worker.
[04:20:47.460 --> 04:20:50.460]  Val: She's supposed to have the child's best interests at heart.
[04:20:50.460 --> 04:20:51.460]  Val: That is her.
[04:20:51.460 --> 04:20:54.460]  Val: When she was hired she could pay $100,000 a year to do that.
[04:20:54.460 --> 04:20:56.460]  Val: And the other guy, 200,000.
[04:20:56.460 --> 04:20:58.460]  Val: They're supposed to be good at their job.
[04:20:58.460 --> 04:21:00.460]  Val: Comes in and starts fucking lying.
[04:21:00.460 --> 04:21:02.460]  Val: And changing the narrative, read it.
[04:21:02.460 --> 04:21:04.460]  Val: See how the narrative changed after page 15?
[04:21:04.460 --> 04:21:06.460]  Val: The narrative changed dramatically.
[04:21:06.460 --> 04:21:07.460]  Val: You'll see.
[04:21:07.460 --> 04:21:09.460]  Val: How do you fight that?
[04:21:09.460 --> 04:21:11.460]  Val: That's fucked up.
[04:21:12.460 --> 04:21:13.660]  Val: That's what's fucked up.
[04:21:13.660 --> 04:21:16.900]  Val: What I was my plan was if I am all I have options,
[04:21:16.900 --> 04:21:19.940]  Val: I'm going to throw it onto the group, one of the signal
[04:21:19.940 --> 04:21:21.740]  Val: groups, and say, look, this is a problem.
[04:21:21.740 --> 04:21:23.340]  Val: I need your help.
[04:21:23.340 --> 04:21:24.660]  Val: What can you do?
[04:21:24.660 --> 04:21:28.500]  Val: And that's done with my last, but then you guys got something.
[04:21:28.500 --> 04:21:29.000]  Val: It's good.
[04:21:29.000 --> 04:21:31.180]  Val: I want to get that was my other choice.
[04:21:31.180 --> 04:21:33.060]  Fed: Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
[04:21:33.060 --> 04:21:34.940]  Val: And it's for Marlowe, I got to go do it.
[04:21:34.940 --> 04:21:36.540]  Fed: No, totally.
[04:21:36.540 --> 04:21:39.780]  Fed: I mean, I hear what you said too, you walk away from here,
[04:21:39.780 --> 04:21:42.260]  Fed: but look at other references for lawyers.
[04:21:42.260 --> 04:21:44.980]  Fed: Because you always think about a bad reference.
[04:21:44.980 --> 04:21:47.540]  Fed: They had their own reasons for introducing you
[04:21:47.540 --> 04:21:49.220]  Fed: to that lawyer.
[04:21:49.220 --> 04:21:52.060]  Val: So if you're bowling under and hearing me, it's systemic.
[04:21:52.060 --> 04:21:55.740]  Val: Like, I'm not having a great, great burden in the world.
[04:21:55.740 --> 04:21:57.020]  Val: It wins everything.
[04:21:57.020 --> 04:21:59.820]  Val: But not in this world, because this world is
[04:21:59.820 --> 04:22:01.420]  Val: run by these people.
[04:22:01.420 --> 04:22:02.900]  Val: They make their own goals.
[04:22:02.900 --> 04:22:07.580]  Val: The law that was first followed, they create their own laws.
[04:22:07.580 --> 04:22:08.460]  Val: That's a problem.
[04:22:09.420 --> 04:22:11.180]  Val: Just read the report, you'll see
[04:22:11.180 --> 04:22:16.740]  Fed: I think it's going back to thinking about Marlowe, like you're better
[04:22:16.740 --> 04:22:19.380]  Fed: off going in with a lawyer than by yourself.
[04:22:19.380 --> 04:22:20.380]  Val: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[04:22:20.380 --> 04:22:21.860]  Val: Yeah, I agree.
[04:22:21.860 --> 04:22:22.860]  Val: Absolutely.
[04:22:22.860 --> 04:22:23.860]  Val: No, absolutely.
[04:22:23.860 --> 04:22:24.860]  Val: Yeah.
[04:22:24.860 --> 04:22:25.860]  Val: I'm going with the lawyer.
[04:22:25.860 --> 04:22:26.860]  Val: We're fine with the lawyer.
[04:22:26.860 --> 04:22:29.340]  Fed: The thing that we're trying to say,
[04:22:29.340 --> 04:22:31.660]  Fed: like, here's the thing, you have to either trust
[04:22:31.660 --> 04:22:33.780]  Fed: that what we're saying is from experience,
[04:22:33.780 --> 04:22:35.380]  Fed: or you don't have to take our opinion.
[04:22:35.380 --> 04:22:37.100]  Fed: I mean, it's just a opinion of three.
[04:22:37.860 --> 04:22:39.820]  Val: I'm just showing you all the data, I just want
[04:22:39.820 --> 04:22:41.380]  Val: to make sure you have everything.
[04:22:41.380 --> 04:22:43.900]  Fed: So the thing would be, if your attorney also
[04:22:43.900 --> 04:22:47.300]  Fed: sees that there's this corrupt system where the judge is
[04:22:47.300 --> 04:22:49.100]  Fed: in bed with everyone else, they may
[04:22:49.100 --> 04:22:50.220]  Fed: be able to change a venue.
[04:22:50.220 --> 04:22:51.180]  Fed: They may be to do something.
[04:22:51.180 --> 04:22:53.260]  Fed: But they would have that knowledge, right?
[04:22:53.260 --> 04:22:54.540]  Fed: Like, I don't have it now.
[04:22:54.540 --> 04:22:57.180]  Fed: They're not a, I don't do child custody battles,
[04:22:57.180 --> 04:22:59.500]  Fed: on a day to day basis. I've dealt with them, certainly.
[04:22:59.500 --> 04:23:00.940]  Fed: A couple of different occasions.
[04:23:00.940 --> 04:23:03.980]  Fed: But those are different situations, different judges
[04:23:03.980 --> 04:23:04.500]  Fed: different people.
[04:23:04.500 --> 04:23:06.740]  Fed: So whatever attorney you get, we'll
[04:23:06.740 --> 04:23:08.300]  Fed: be able to look after your best interests.
[04:23:08.300 --> 04:23:10.180]  Fed: The point would be, though, is you have to trust
[04:23:10.180 --> 04:23:11.740]  Fed: that that attorney is going to be good,
[04:23:11.740 --> 04:23:13.700]  Fed: and is going to be looking after your best interests.
[04:23:13.700 --> 04:23:15.540]  Fed: So do your research, and maybe we
[04:23:15.540 --> 04:23:18.180]  Fed: can help with that, if that would be the best option.
[04:23:18.180 --> 04:23:19.980]  Fed: But I'm trying to find a good solution for you,
[04:23:19.980 --> 04:23:21.740]  Fed: because I don't want you to walk away from here thinking,
[04:23:21.740 --> 04:23:23.980]  Fed: like, well, if I don't care, I do want to help you.
[04:23:23.980 --> 04:23:26.260]  Fed: But we need to think of realistic ways we can help you.
[04:23:26.260 --> 04:23:27.820]  Fed: And that would be the best way to do it.
[04:23:27.820 --> 04:23:28.820]  Val: Sorry, maybe you're right.
[04:23:28.820 --> 04:23:29.660]  Val: I'm just thinking.
[04:23:29.660 --> 04:23:31.860]  Val: So realistic way would be to play their game,
[04:23:31.860 --> 04:23:33.700]  Val: find out what their rules are, and play their game.
[04:23:33.700 --> 04:23:36.700]  Val: So that's the idea.
[04:23:37.660 --> 04:23:39.540]  Fed: I mean, I don't want you to be upset.
[04:23:39.540 --> 04:23:41.860]  Fed: I mean, it's know it's emotional, and I understand.
[04:23:41.860 --> 04:23:43.060]  Val: I was sort of throwing it out there,
[04:23:43.060 --> 04:23:44.820]  Val: seeing if you guys were interested in doing this whole,
[04:23:44.820 --> 04:23:47.420]  Val: let's take down the system and create a new system in its place.
[04:23:47.420 --> 04:23:49.420]  Val: But I don't think you're there yet.
[04:23:49.420 --> 04:23:51.220]  Val: But I do want to do that at some point.
[04:23:51.220 --> 04:23:52.980]  Val: But right now, I have to get Marlowe focused.
[04:23:52.980 --> 04:23:54.940]  Val: I'm just going to say, right now, it's play their game.
[04:23:54.940 --> 04:23:55.780]  Val: That's fine.
[04:23:55.780 --> 04:23:56.660]  Val: It's perfectly fine.
[04:23:56.660 --> 04:24:01.620]  Val: But yeah, OK, no worries.
[04:24:01.620 --> 04:24:04.660]  Fed: And I think some of those things are being addressed.
[04:24:04.660 --> 04:24:05.540]  Val: They are?
[04:24:05.540 --> 04:24:11.660]  Fed: Yeah, I think there's a lot of your of that whole process.
[04:24:11.660 --> 04:24:16.060]  Fed: When we talk here, and I think what I want to make sure you
[04:24:16.060 --> 04:24:19.020]  Fed: understand is that we'll focus on being successful,
[04:24:19.020 --> 04:24:21.620]  Fed: because that's your immediate need, right?
[04:24:21.620 --> 04:24:23.540]  Fed: And then there's the overall need.
[04:24:23.540 --> 04:24:25.460]  Fed: What can we solve quickly?
[04:24:25.460 --> 04:24:26.820]  Fed: What needs to be addressed quickly?
[04:24:26.820 --> 04:24:31.060]  Fed: And then the bigger thing, the bigger aspect of it.
[04:24:31.060 --> 04:24:36.180]  Fed: It's not that we're not interested in that, because we are.
[04:24:36.180 --> 04:24:38.380]  Val: Yeah, one thing at a time.
[04:24:38.380 --> 04:24:41.740]  Fed: Well, you're here right here.
[04:24:41.740 --> 04:24:44.500]  Fed: What's your number one goal?
[04:24:44.500 --> 04:24:46.380]  Fed: Marlowe, right?
[04:24:46.380 --> 04:24:48.780]  Fed: So when you ask a question, it's not
[04:24:48.780 --> 04:24:52.860]  Fed: that we're side stepping the issues, whatever it is.
[04:24:52.860 --> 04:24:56.100]  Fed: We're focused on, because we're addressing.
[04:24:56.100 --> 04:24:57.540]  Val: Oh, no, absolutely.
[04:24:57.540 --> 04:24:58.420]  Val: Sorry.
[04:24:58.420 --> 04:25:00.180]  Val: Yes, I hope that you didn't think
[04:25:01.140 --> 04:25:04.460]  Val: No, I don't think it's such a, I just, I do this all the time,
[04:25:04.460 --> 04:25:07.140]  Val: because I mean with this book, I just think you guys,
[04:25:07.140 --> 04:25:09.100]  Val: you don't know all the data, and if you just knew all the data,
[04:25:09.100 --> 04:25:11.340]  Val: you'd see how I see it.
[04:25:11.340 --> 04:25:12.660]  Val: That's what I'm thinking.
[04:25:12.660 --> 04:25:13.740]  Val: It doesn't mean it's true.
[04:25:13.740 --> 04:25:15.300]  Fed: But it's important to me.
[04:25:15.300 --> 04:25:20.260]  Fed: And yeah, as what you do, and what I've committed myself to do,
[04:25:20.260 --> 04:25:22.660]  Fed: is I want you to understand what we're coming from.
[04:25:22.660 --> 04:25:24.260]  Fed: I don't want you to walk away like,
[04:25:24.260 --> 04:25:25.740]  Fed: I don't want to give a shit about the bigger problems.
[04:25:25.740 --> 04:25:26.900]  Fed: No, we do.
[04:25:26.900 --> 04:25:28.860]  Fed: But right now, you're in front of us.
[04:25:28.940 --> 04:25:29.780]  Fed: How do we help you out?
[04:25:29.780 --> 04:25:32.260]  Val: Okay, thank you.
[04:25:32.260 --> 04:25:34.700]  Val: And thank you again.
[04:25:34.700 --> 04:25:36.500]  Fed: And again, that's our opinion.
[04:25:36.500 --> 04:25:40.700]  Fed: So it's not legal, it's just my opinion.
[04:25:40.700 --> 04:25:41.540]  Val: Cool.
[04:25:41.540 --> 04:25:44.260]  Val: And yeah, sorry, I know what you're doing.
[04:25:44.260 --> 04:25:48.300]  Val: I wasn't, yeah, can we just throw that out there?
[04:25:48.300 --> 04:25:50.500]  Fed: No, no, no, I just want to, sometimes,
[04:25:50.500 --> 04:25:52.380]  Fed: I think it's always better,
[04:25:52.380 --> 04:25:53.700]  Fed: and maybe this is a fault of mine,
[04:25:53.700 --> 04:25:55.700]  Fed: is to be more articulate and clear,
[04:25:55.700 --> 04:25:58.100]  Fed: and to clarify stuff, so that when we walk away,
[04:25:58.100 --> 04:26:02.140]  Fed: we're clear about what the perception was,
[04:26:02.140 --> 04:26:04.820]  Fed: or what the intent was, but not intent to accept.
[04:26:04.820 --> 04:26:06.780]  Val: I know your intent, yeah, no, I trust your intent,
[04:26:06.780 --> 04:26:09.780]  Val: absolutely, I do trust your intent, obviously.
[04:26:11.260 --> 04:26:13.180]  Val: That, yeah, and I hope you trust mine.
[04:26:14.940 --> 04:26:16.180]  Val: You can do something you can work on,
[04:26:16.180 --> 04:26:19.220]  Val: if you need me, like I told you before,
[04:26:19.220 --> 04:26:20.500]  Val: you know, even if you can't do anything,
[04:26:20.500 --> 04:26:23.580]  Val: and I've been through that before with Tim and Jan,
[04:26:23.580 --> 04:26:26.340]  Val: and when they get stuck on some sort of bureaucratic thing,
[04:26:26.340 --> 04:26:29.460]  Val: I'm still happy to help, so, 
Fed: appreciate that.
[04:26:30.780 --> 04:26:33.340]  Fed: Good deal, I think we got a good, good work and plan.
[04:26:34.340 --> 04:26:36.580]  Fed: Maybe, I mean, I'll even try to do some research
[04:26:36.580 --> 04:26:39.060]  Fed: on a lawyer for you, and give you some suggestions,
[04:26:39.060 --> 04:26:40.260]  Fed: or something like that, I don't know,
[04:26:40.260 --> 04:26:41.380]  Fed: we'll see what I can do.
[04:26:41.380 --> 04:26:44.220]  Fed: I don't know, just do the same research you can do,
[04:26:44.220 --> 04:26:46.700]  Fed: but at least I can give you a,
[04:26:46.700 --> 04:26:48.980]  Fed: okay, well, this looks good, that doesn't look good,
[04:26:48.980 --> 04:26:51.460]  Fed: but anyway, we'll go for that part first,
[04:26:51.460 --> 04:26:52.780]  Fed: and then if you find anything else,
[04:26:52.780 --> 04:26:55.340]  Fed: then you can tell us who would be good.
[04:26:55.340 --> 04:26:58.780]  Val: I'll, can you do more specific with help with?
[04:26:58.780 --> 04:27:01.060]  Val: Yeah, I mean, do you know what I'm doing now?
[04:27:01.060 --> 04:27:02.420]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[04:27:02.420 --> 04:27:04.060]  Fed: So, like, today was just to assess
[04:27:04.060 --> 04:27:06.940]  Fed: what kind of access you have, or what kind of skills you have.
[04:27:06.940 --> 04:27:08.780]  Fed: So what I'll do is I'll write this up and ask around,
[04:27:08.780 --> 04:27:10.300]  Fed: like maybe there's someone who might call a crime
[04:27:10.300 --> 04:27:12.900]  Fed: who has, you know, a need for something
[04:27:12.900 --> 04:27:14.940]  Fed: that you can help with, and then I'll find them and say,
[04:27:14.940 --> 04:27:15.940]  Fed: hey, this is what he's got,
[04:27:15.940 --> 04:27:18.020]  Fed: this is the skills he has, this is the access he has.
[04:27:18.020 --> 04:27:20.180]  Fed: That's all based on what we've said today.
[04:27:20.180 --> 04:27:21.220]  Fed: That's why if there's anything else
[04:27:21.220 --> 04:27:23.700]  Fed: that you have access to, or crimes that you're aware of,
[04:27:23.700 --> 04:27:25.140]  Fed: all those things are useful,
[04:27:25.140 --> 04:27:27.060]  Fed: because then we can use that to say,
[04:27:27.060 --> 04:27:28.700]  Fed: okay, this person can use you to this person.
[04:27:28.700 --> 04:27:29.540]  Val: Oh, okay.
[04:27:29.540 --> 04:27:30.380]  Fed: Does that make sense?
[04:27:30.380 --> 04:27:31.220]  Val: Yeah, it makes sense.
[04:27:31.220 --> 04:27:33.340]  Fed: Right now, we're just the gatekeepers
[04:27:33.340 --> 04:27:35.980]  Fed: of your information, like, you give us the information,
[04:27:35.980 --> 04:27:37.780]  Fed: we send it out to other bureau people,
[04:27:37.780 --> 04:27:39.620]  Fed: because we can't have 800 people in the room right now.
[04:27:39.620 --> 04:27:41.460]  Val: Right, right, so it's a placement.
[04:27:41.460 --> 04:27:42.300]  Fed: That's right, okay.
[04:27:42.300 --> 04:27:43.140]  Val: Okay, yeah.
[04:27:43.140 --> 04:27:44.100]  Fed: That's the whole reason we're here,
[04:27:44.100 --> 04:27:46.220]  Fed: is just to see what you can provide us
[04:27:46.220 --> 04:27:48.100]  Fed: so that we can help you, make sense.
[04:27:48.100 --> 04:27:51.700]  Val: Okay, I will be putting a list of journalism.
[04:27:51.700 --> 04:27:52.540]  Val: Right.
[04:27:52.900 --> 04:27:54.180]  Val: Any journalists I can always get?
[04:27:54.180 --> 04:27:55.540]  Val: I can get to anybody.
[04:27:55.540 --> 04:27:59.660]  Val: And I can, I'm not, I can't get anything,
[04:27:59.660 --> 04:28:02.140]  Val: but I can get a pretty good amount of data.
[04:28:03.500 --> 04:28:05.220]  Fed: And it would be a more specific ask, too.
[04:28:05.220 --> 04:28:07.300]  Fed: We would say, okay, hey, do you know
[04:28:07.300 --> 04:28:10.260]  Fed: X person at the Miami Herald or something like that?
[04:28:10.260 --> 04:28:11.500]  Fed: What do you know about them?
[04:28:11.500 --> 04:28:12.340]  Fed: And that would be someone else,
[04:28:12.340 --> 04:28:13.180]  Fed: That wouldn't it be me?
[04:28:13.180 --> 04:28:14.780]  Fed: Probably someone out of Miami, right?
[04:28:14.780 --> 04:28:17.540]  Fed: So, anyway, we're gonna take all this stuff
[04:28:17.540 --> 04:28:20.740]  Fed: and digest it, hopefully we can help you out at the same time.
[04:28:20.740 --> 04:28:21.580]  Fed: But if you have any questions,
[04:28:21.580 --> 04:28:25.140]  Fed: you can always give me a call or, you know,
[04:28:25.140 --> 04:28:28.060]  Fed: so these guys are in LA, and I'm obviously in Houston,
[04:28:28.060 --> 04:28:31.060]  Fed: but you know, either way, we can help you out, okay?
[04:28:31.060 --> 04:28:34.580]  Val: Okay, are you not gonna be an LA person?
[04:28:34.580 --> 04:28:35.420]  Fed: No.
[04:28:35.420 --> 04:28:36.340]  Val: You're gonna be a Houston person.
[04:28:36.340 --> 04:28:37.620]  Fed: I'm a Houston person, okay.
[04:28:37.620 --> 04:28:39.500]  Fed: Yeah, so if anything develops,
[04:28:39.500 --> 04:28:41.220]  Fed: you'll probably be [unintelligible]
[04:28:41.220 --> 04:28:42.900]  Val: Yeah, you're okay.
[04:28:42.900 --> 04:28:46.620]  Val: Okay, so you just came out here to assess me.
[04:28:46.620 --> 04:28:48.620]  Val: Cool, man, thank you.
[04:28:48.620 --> 04:28:50.180]  Flattered, thank you, kind of.
[04:28:50.300 --> 04:28:51.900]  Val: You can come all the way down there, right?
[04:28:51.900 --> 04:28:52.740]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:28:53.740 --> 04:28:55.300]  Val: Oh, cool

[Conversation ends, Val indistinctly asks about Marie, Fed says he'll talk to her later]
