[00:00.000 --> 00:03.440]  Ko: So, she had a very, yeah, very small recital.
[00:03.440 --> 00:06.120]  Marie: It's a big deal for her.
[00:06.120 --> 00:07.200]  Ko: Of course it is, I know.
[00:07.200 --> 00:09.840]  Ko: And she understands that when work comes up, I have to go.
[00:09.840 --> 00:12.560]  Ko: But, you know, at the very least, what I should do,
[00:12.560 --> 00:14.520]  Ko: like, you know, I should please go back.
[00:14.520 --> 00:17.560]  Ko: And, you know, I got her a little something from L.A.
[00:18.560 --> 00:20.560]  Marie: Oh, that's so cute.
[00:20.560 --> 00:22.480]  Ko: I can catch her before she goes back to sleep.
[00:22.480 --> 00:23.760]  Ko: But that's why I can't tell.
[00:23.760 --> 00:25.960]  Ko: You know, I would love to come right now.
[00:25.960 --> 00:28.320]  Ko: I'm seriously trying to catch her to the airport myself,
[00:28.320 --> 00:29.880]  Ko: which I don't know if I'll make the flight,
[00:29.880 --> 00:32.720]  Ko: but I at least want to make the effort to see if I can.
[00:32.720 --> 00:33.560]  Marie: Okay, I see.
[00:33.560 --> 00:35.200]  Marie: Well, if you don't,
[00:35.200 --> 00:36.800]  Marie: you actually, once you're at the airport,
[00:36.800 --> 00:39.480]  Marie: you're not too far from where we are.
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.760]  Marie: Come here, like seriously.
[00:41.760 --> 00:42.600]  Marie: Just come.
[00:42.600 --> 00:43.840]  Ko: Oh, no, I appreciate that.
[00:43.840 --> 00:46.320]  Marie: And then we're gonna have to, like, don't,
[00:46.320 --> 00:50.200]  Marie: I mean, if you want, not, obviously if you want.
[00:50.200 --> 00:54.440]  Marie: But yeah, there is actually traffic, traffic is back.
[00:54.440 --> 00:59.440]  Marie: So, I don't know how long you've allowed yourself.
[01:00.120 --> 01:02.840]  Ko: It's gonna be very close, unfortunately.
[01:02.840 --> 01:03.800]  Marie: Well, okay.
[01:03.800 --> 01:06.400]  Marie: Well, you know, you have a plan B.
[01:06.400 --> 01:07.960]  Marie: It's easier, so.
[01:09.160 --> 01:10.880]  Ko: At worst, I'll give you a call.
[01:10.880 --> 01:12.560]  Ko: I'll tell you I'm stopping by, but.
[01:12.560 --> 01:13.520]  Marie: No, seriously.
[01:13.520 --> 01:15.160]  Marie: Yeah, do that.
[01:15.160 --> 01:16.080]  Marie: You might not make it.
[01:16.080 --> 01:18.560]  Marie: Sounds like you might not make it.
[01:18.560 --> 01:21.160]  Ko: Who knows, right now I am sitting in a good bit of traffic
[01:21.160 --> 01:23.960]  Ko: on the 405, so it may take a little while.
[01:23.960 --> 01:27.080]  Ko: But I also wanted to tell you just about,
[01:27.080 --> 01:29.000]  Ko: so we had a very good conversation with Val
[01:29.080 --> 01:31.560]  Ko: and, you know, we got to learn some things
[01:31.560 --> 01:32.880]  Ko: and he got to learn some things from us.
[01:32.880 --> 01:35.920]  Ko: So, the other thing I also wanted to tell you,
[01:35.920 --> 01:39.160]  Ko: which I told you on Sunday as well, you and Val,
[01:39.160 --> 01:41.520]  Ko: is that there are some things that he may not be able
[01:41.520 --> 01:42.600]  Ko: to tell you directly about.
[01:42.600 --> 01:45.520]  Ko: I know you guys have a very open and honest relationship,
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.360]  Ko: which is perfect.
[01:46.360 --> 01:49.880]  Ko: I would want nothing less from both of you.
[01:49.880 --> 01:53.520]  Ko: But there's some things that he's gonna talk to about us,
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.960]  Ko: you know, with us and the things that he's interested in,
[01:57.960 --> 01:59.360]  Marie: that you would not share with me.
[01:59.360 --> 02:00.920]  Marie:Yeah, yeah, no, I understand.
[02:00.920 --> 02:03.360]  Ko: Yeah, and that's just for everyone's protection.
[02:03.360 --> 02:05.520]  Ko: That's mainly for you because if you know about it,
[02:05.520 --> 02:09.000]  Ko: then you could become a witness and I don't want that.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.200]  Ko: You know, it's really, it's no danger to me
[02:11.200 --> 02:12.840]  Ko: because it doesn't really affect me much,
[02:12.840 --> 02:15.000]  Ko: but it's more like if you know about it too,
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.240]  Ko: then if it's something that has to be testified, you know,
[02:18.240 --> 02:20.680]  Ko: then when they ask, does anyone else know about it?
[02:20.680 --> 02:22.360]  Ko: I think there's, oh yeah, I felt like, you know,
[02:22.360 --> 02:24.360]  Ko: like, is it your girlfriend or is it wife?
[02:25.360 --> 02:29.760]  Marie: Yes, I'm currently in this divorce proceeding, so.
[02:29.760 --> 02:31.080]  Ko: Of course, yeah.
[02:31.080 --> 02:31.920]  Ko: Yeah.
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.200]  Ko: So anyway, so you know, I talk to my girlfriend
[02:35.200 --> 02:38.280]  Ko: and then they say, okay, well, we need to subpoena her.
[02:38.280 --> 02:40.960]  Ko: And then you have to be on the witness ban too
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.440]  Ko: to answer questions, to validate some things.
[02:44.440 --> 02:46.880]  Ko: And that's not good, that's not good for anyone.
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.000]  Ko: Because your identity is out there and anyway, so.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.480]  Marie: I know, you can, oh, okay, no, no,
[02:53.480 --> 02:55.880]  Marie: you can trust in me, I won't ask questions
[02:55.880 --> 02:57.360]  Marie: and whatever he tells me, he tells me,
[02:57.360 --> 03:00.120]  Marie: I won't torture him for that.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.360]  Ko: Of course, of course.
[03:02.360 --> 03:03.200]  Marie: Okay.
[03:03.200 --> 03:05.360]  Ko: And you have my number too, it's like,
[03:05.360 --> 03:08.200]  Ko: what I was telling Val is that if you independently,
[03:08.200 --> 03:10.800]  Ko: like say Val is out or something like that,
[03:10.800 --> 03:13.200]  Ko: and you know, you think he says, oh hey,
[03:13.200 --> 03:15.080]  Ko: I'm gonna go work with David,
[03:15.080 --> 03:16.720]  Ko: you can call me at the, hey, you know,
[03:16.720 --> 03:19.080]  Ko: is he okay, is he all right, and I'll tell you, of course,
[03:19.080 --> 03:20.800]  Ko: like yeah, he's fine, he's safe.
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.720]  Ko: And then if we decide to work together,
[03:22.720 --> 03:26.920]  Ko: right now, I have to find something for him to do,
[03:26.920 --> 03:29.600]  Ko: but it's nothing that I would directly
[03:29.600 --> 03:31.360]  Ko: be working with him on, so.
[03:31.360 --> 03:32.200]  Marie: Okay.
[03:32.200 --> 03:34.200]  Ko: Anyway, we'll be on the witness stand.
[03:34.200 --> 03:37.600]  Marie: He's a very talented man, he's got many talents.
[03:38.880 --> 03:41.520]  Ko: Yes, I agree, I hear he's got a lot of talent
[03:41.520 --> 03:42.400]  Ko: and lots of skills.
[03:42.400 --> 03:47.400]  Marie: Yes, he's got a set, a wide range of skills.
[03:48.400 --> 03:50.480]  Ko: Yeah, I know he's got a lot of talent.
[03:50.480 --> 03:52.080]  Marie: As you do too, I'm sure.
[03:53.760 --> 03:56.560]  Ko: No, not me, I've got a very limited number of skills
[03:56.560 --> 03:58.520]  Ko: and unfortunately, I need help,
[03:58.520 --> 04:01.440]  Ko: I need help from everyone to do the things we do,
[04:01.440 --> 04:04.960]  Ko: so I appreciate Val's help going in to help us out,
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.720]  Ko: so hopefully we can find him something to work on.
[04:08.720 --> 04:11.120]  Ko: Right now, I'm gonna have to go back and ask some people
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.640]  Ko: and see what they say and see if anyone has any interest.
[04:15.640 --> 04:17.600]  Ko: And I told Val, and like I'm telling you,
[04:17.600 --> 04:19.520]  Ko: I can't promise that we'll have anything
[04:19.520 --> 04:22.080]  Ko: for him to work on, but he has my number too,
[04:22.080 --> 04:24.160]  Ko: so maybe something else comes up and says,
[04:24.160 --> 04:27.080]  Ko: hey, I've got some good information on this or that,
[04:27.080 --> 04:29.560]  Ko: okay, and then we try to find a good home for it,
[04:29.560 --> 04:33.440]  Ko: but up until then, it's kind of up in the air
[04:33.440 --> 04:35.680]  Ko: unfortunately, so we'll see how things go.
[04:35.680 --> 04:40.680]  Marie: Okay, and you're happy with your trip and your research
[04:40.880 --> 04:42.480]  Marie: and what you wanted to achieve?
[04:43.480 --> 04:46.000]  Ko: Yeah, yeah, I mean, my job today
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.200]  Ko: was just to see what Val's skills were,
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.920]  Ko: like you said, he's a very talented person,
[04:49.920 --> 04:52.760]  Ko: he has a lot of good friends, a lot of good access,
[04:52.760 --> 04:55.960]  Ko: so those are the things that my job is just to go and see,
[04:55.960 --> 04:59.520]  Ko: and then I go up and write a report and I tell everyone,
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.240]  Ko: okay, well maybe he can help on that or maybe he can help
[05:03.240 --> 05:07.360]  Ko: on that, but like I said, I don't have anything personally
[05:07.360 --> 05:11.520]  Ko: that I would work with him on because that's not my thing,
[05:11.640 --> 05:14.120]  Ko: so anyway, that's my main job,
[05:14.120 --> 05:17.080]  Ko: it's just to test and see how things go
[05:17.080 --> 05:18.920]  Ko: and then they work out great,
[05:18.920 --> 05:21.040]  Ko: and if not, you know, we still keep the line open
[05:21.040 --> 05:24.000]  Ko: and you can always call him saying he's got more access
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.680]  Ko: or he's got something else and we're good to go,
[05:26.680 --> 05:29.400]  Ko: but yeah, and we need to talk about M,
[05:29.400 --> 05:32.480]  Ko: I'm sure Val will tell you all the details about it,
[05:32.480 --> 05:34.240]  Ko: and it is an unfortunate situation
[05:34.240 --> 05:37.040]  Ko: he got like deep in the 70s because I understand
[05:37.040 --> 05:38.800]  Ko: if someone was trying to take a child,
[05:38.800 --> 05:41.280]  Ko: it is the worst thing that you can imagine,
[05:42.280 --> 05:44.360]  Marie: it's also so bizarre, I mean,
[05:44.360 --> 05:48.960]  Marie: it's the, here and see, the, you know,
[05:48.960 --> 05:51.800]  Marie: I mean, there's certain situation that you can like,
[05:51.800 --> 05:54.240]  Marie: well, you know, that brings that,
[05:54.240 --> 05:56.280]  Marie: that will bring that consequence,
[05:56.280 --> 06:00.120]  Marie: but that's not the case, you know, I mean,
[06:01.880 --> 06:04.560]  Marie: there's certain terrain, you know,
[06:04.560 --> 06:09.360]  Marie: you can put in terrain that the certain kind of seeds
[06:09.440 --> 06:11.400]  Marie: that bring certain kind of plants,
[06:11.400 --> 06:15.160]  Marie: and that's just not the case here,
[06:15.160 --> 06:17.920]  Marie: there's no reason for that, and so,
[06:20.200 --> 06:21.880]  Marie: it's very baffling, you know.
[06:21.880 --> 06:23.920]  Ko: And so, yeah, I know, I know.
[06:23.920 --> 06:27.640]  Ko: And I think, I mean, the best thing I can say is,
[06:27.640 --> 06:30.680]  Ko: I know it sounds, you know, of course you wanna relax,
[06:30.680 --> 06:33.960]  Ko: but take deep breaths when things get stressful
[06:33.960 --> 06:35.040]  Ko: and things will work out,
[06:35.040 --> 06:37.160]  Ko: we'll help you guys as best we can.
[06:37.160 --> 06:38.000]  Marie: Right.
[06:38.280 --> 06:39.600]  Ko: What I told Val is,
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.080]  Ko: I know you guys fired your last attorney
[06:41.080 --> 06:42.840]  Ko: because something was weird with that guy,
[06:42.840 --> 06:47.640]  Ko: but hopefully, you're able to find a good attorney,
[06:47.640 --> 06:50.560]  Ko: I'm gonna do some work to see if I can help
[06:50.560 --> 06:52.400]  Ko: and find a good attorney,
[06:52.400 --> 06:53.240]  Ko: I'll just give you, you know,
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.320]  Ko: I'll just give you a recommendation,
[06:54.320 --> 06:56.320]  Marie: but yeah, of course.
[06:58.320 --> 06:59.960]  Ko: And then, but once you get a good attorney,
[06:59.960 --> 07:04.000]  Ko: I think you guys will be in a better spot, so, anyway.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.200]  Val: Hey, hey guys, sorry, hey, the other half of the cannoli.
[07:07.280 --> 07:08.400]  Marie: He came in the room just now.
[07:08.400 --> 07:10.440]  Val: I'm eating your cannoli.
[07:10.440 --> 07:12.440]  Val: I was gonna save you a cannoli, David,
[07:12.440 --> 07:13.440]  Val: but I'm gonna eat it now.
[07:13.440 --> 07:14.760]  Marie: Well, I think he might miss the flight.
[07:14.760 --> 07:15.600]  Val: Oh, really?
[07:15.600 --> 07:16.440]  Val: He might miss the flight?
[07:16.440 --> 07:17.280]  Val: Oh, dude, come over.
[07:17.280 --> 07:18.960]  Val: You should really miss the flight.
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.360]  Val: You might have half a cannoli.
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.960]  Ko: Oh, trust me.
[07:22.960 --> 07:24.040]  Ko: I would love to come over
[07:24.040 --> 07:26.760]  Ko: because eating your deliciously,
[07:26.760 --> 07:29.120]  Ko: you know, home cooked food is better than my carton meal,
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.080]  Ko: which is nothing.
[07:30.080 --> 07:31.040]  Val: She's good, dude.
[07:31.040 --> 07:32.040]  Val: She's so good.
[07:32.040 --> 07:36.120]  Ko: So, I would say I would love to eat with you guys.
[07:36.120 --> 07:39.640]  Ko: I absolutely would rather eat than jump on a flight
[07:39.640 --> 07:41.200]  Ko: and go hungry the whole night,
[07:41.200 --> 07:43.240]  Ko: but at the same time, I think my daughter
[07:43.240 --> 07:45.120]  Ko: hopefully will appreciate this one day.
[07:45.120 --> 07:45.960]  Ko: That's the-
[07:45.960 --> 07:48.280]  Marie: How many kids, you have, David.
[07:48.280 --> 07:49.280]  Ko: Just the one so far.
[07:49.280 --> 07:50.280]  Marie: Oh, okay, okay.
[07:50.280 --> 07:51.120]  Marie: Oh, cool.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.200]  Marie: Yeah, well, see how you go?
[07:53.200 --> 07:54.920]  Marie: If the plane is not there,
[07:54.920 --> 07:57.400]  Marie: you can't do anything about it.
[07:57.400 --> 07:58.240]  Val: Yeah, just come over.
[07:58.240 --> 08:01.840]  Val: You can crash upstairs to have an extra bedroom.
[08:01.840 --> 08:03.880]  Marie: You have many skills,
[08:03.880 --> 08:06.000]  Marie: but you can't-
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.440]  Val: Tell me, you can crash upstairs too.
[08:08.440 --> 08:09.280]  Ko: That's of course not.
[08:09.280 --> 08:10.120]  Val: You can crash upstairs.
[08:10.120 --> 08:11.280]  Marie: Yes, and we have space.
[08:11.280 --> 08:12.560]  Marie: This is a big place.
[08:12.560 --> 08:13.400]  Val: Yeah, you can crash upstairs.
[08:13.400 --> 08:14.400]  Val: There's lots of space.
[08:14.400 --> 08:15.240]  Marie: Yeah, yeah.
[08:15.240 --> 08:16.080]  Ko: You're-
[08:16.080 --> 08:17.360]  Ko: Hey, if something comes up,
[08:17.360 --> 08:18.760]  Ko: I will give you guys a call
[08:18.760 --> 08:20.040]  Ko: and they'll take it over over
[08:20.040 --> 08:21.120]  Ko: and then we'll have a meal.
[08:21.120 --> 08:23.600]  Ko: But right now, hopefully,
[08:23.600 --> 08:24.440]  Ko: I'll be able to get there
[08:24.440 --> 08:25.840]  Ko: and be able to be get there, but I'm gonna be cutting it close.
[08:25.840 --> 08:27.040]  Marie: Okay, see how you go?
[08:27.040 --> 08:27.960]  Marie: Let us know.
[08:27.960 --> 08:30.920]  Marie: Either way, this house is yours,

[09:21.360 --> 09:22.360]  Marie: this is not what you want,
[09:22.360 --> 09:23.360]  Marie: but he will be part of it.
