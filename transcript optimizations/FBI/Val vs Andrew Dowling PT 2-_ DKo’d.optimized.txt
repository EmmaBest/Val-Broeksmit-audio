[00:00.000]  Val: Say that again, but say again you you you I sorry I got write this down now because now you lost me. Hold on. Let me get a pen. Oh There's the band-aids. Found 'em.
[00:24.640]  Val: By the way, that's an old check of mine. Make people feel more comfortable when I say oh, Hold on. Let me just get a pen and piece of paper so I can write this down. So that way you don't think that I'm recording you [laughter]
[00:45.000]  Val: All right, what do I say what do I say? I did I actually do have a pen and paper now you said ask him what?
[00:52.160]  ??: So initially ask him like why can't you proactively take Information from me?,
Val:okay, why can't you proactively pro does proactive have a hyphen?
[01:05.080]  Overlaping: Proactively no retain retain information from me
[01:11.160]  Val: Okay, I'll obtain obtain. Oh not retain Well, you can retain it. No, you can retain anything You know, anally you can retain a lot anal retentive information Why can't you? 
???: anyway proactively you figure out how you want to phrase that okay?
[01:31.420]  ??: And then if you tap the answers and doesn't give you a direct answer, okay? ask him if The information that he could receive from you
[01:46.300]  ??: Have privileged information which tainted him off a case. 
Val: Oh
[01:52.460]  Val: Okay, so any info he received for me could contain may contain privileged information
??: Privileged
[02:02.300]  Val: That would take him off the case
[02:05.660]  ??: Yeah, and then if he doesn't answer there saydid information that you provided get him in trouble or did he just get himself in trouble on the Russia stuff. Like like is it something that it's specific to you where like if you go and you give information to David? Is that obstruction gonna go to David or is that just sticking with Tim? Because Tim misbehaved himself and fucked up somewhere along. 
Val: Oh, no Tim is saying if I give data to him to not to not to Ko but to him it would be obstruction or if he asked asked me
??: So chances are Tim fucked up somewhere along the way and put himself in a corner
[02:55.300] Val: Yeah, and I think that was by trusting me because the next thing everything's on the New York Times. Right, yeah, but David Ko is calling me back right now. Hold on. Let me turn on the word. Let me call you right back. Okay.
??: Bye
[03:12.220]  Val: Hello. David, what's up? What happened?
[03:16.780]  Ko: Well, I told you I had a meeting. 
Val: Okay. I thought you were hanging up already
[03:21.900]  Ko: Now, sorry. Okay. Good. I told you when remember when I first called you I said hey, I gotta go to meeting in five minutes and then 15 minutes later. I said, okay. I gotta go to the meeting. Hey, what did I say? I'm like, dude, I told you I had to go to the meeting. What are you?
[03:34.140]  Val: Sorry, I missed that five minutes thing. I didn't hear that one. Sorry. I just maybe the phone died
[03:38.620]  Val: But uh, okay. Sorry. So what do you think?
[03:44.300]  Ko: Um, like I said the stuff with Rick Cohen and Kurt Weldon, I mean
[03:51.020]  Ko: I mean, I'll add the Kurt Weldon stuff in see if that interests anyone. 
Val: Um, I can get you a dossier
[03:57.340]  Val: like a Dossier like I'm sort of a so you understand it. Andrew, I think would be happy to provide one or maybe he's already got one like an outline of the basic gist of the whole story. And the players yeah, and the names and players involved. Okay, I'll do that. Let me write that down. Actually, hold on. Because otherwise I am gonna forget this. Okay, so uh dossier on Weldon and Russian thing. But that's separate from FSB guy in LA so it's two
[04:27.340]  Ko: Okay. Did you do you text me the FSB guy's name yet or 
Val: I have not no
[04:33.900]  Val: Oh, I'm still writing this down dossier and Weldon. Okay, um, You know what could we use Signal from now on or I mean are you that secure with your with your iMessages?
[04:47.260]  Ko: I mean, well, I don't have Signal when we can install signal on our work phone. I mean, I just buy a drop phone and use it. But are you worried about people like hacking in and stealing stuff? 
Val: Yeah, you know, it's pretty
[05:01.100]  Val: It, I mean if I can do it be someone else will do it to me, you know, so I'm pretty sure people. Uh, just iMessage. I don't know. I mean, it's encrypted end to end. So I don't know why maybe I'm just being paranoid, but let me just check my text. So I I'll have it right here. It's better to tell it to you than to text it is what I mean. For that in-lessons Signal.
[05:21.500]  Val: Um, we think this woman's number, Um, Are you still in Houston in Houston?
[05:29.740]  Ko: Mm-hmm. 
Val: Let me see this thing
[05:35.900]  Val: Oh, here we go. Okay, um. This name is k r b o y a n. That's the family name
[05:46.300]  Ko: Sorry [could you] say that name again
[05:48.060]  Val: k r b o y a n
[05:54.300]  Ko: [Repeats name in phonetic alphabet]
[05:59.900]  Val: K Like uh Ko david Ko. Okay R like ricochet B like uh bonanza O like orient Y like yandex A antelope N neuro
[06:15.180]  Ko: Okay, sounds good. Is that last name?
[06:18.060]  Val: Sorry, that's the last name. Yeah, that's a family name. Um the number. Wait, wait, uh, okay number four two four. Three four six four nine zero four. That's one of his main. That's his main number. Three four six four nine zed four. Oh, sorry, wait, wait, sorry, that's that's. Sorry, that's the wrong one. Sorry. It's eight seven zero across that out. That's a different number. Actually, I don't know what the hell is that number? Wait. Yeah, you know what keep that number. That's the second number
[06:56.540]  Val: Try this. This is the other one. I think this is a fake. Um This is an internet number though because it has a it's the eight seven zero eight zero zero eight zero eight zero. Oh, yeah, yeah d o b, uh January 13th 1983 first name Arman A r m a n.
[07:23.580]  Ko: Okay, so what is our FSB officer up to? 
Val: Yes. Why is he in LA? And why is he uh,
[07:32.940]  Val: Why is he so close to me now? And am I being paranoid? Because this woman she came into my life very strangely I hired a private investigator. And the private investigator, uh, really good guy worked under the police force for a long time. I might have told you this already. 30 years on the force and then deputy sheriff and then he was a detective for many of those years and instead of going to politics and becoming a sheriff he went became PI and he's a very renowned well-known PI.
[08:07.740]  Val: He's introduced me to her And said that she's very interested in these little cords. I have these things. I kind of
[08:17.100]  Val: I don't make them, but I sort of have like a it's like a hobby. You know the OMG cords
[08:24.940]  Ko: I can't say I do 
Val: oh come on. You're a hacker. I thought you're a hacker
[08:29.740]  Ko: OMG card 
Val: code no cord OMG
[08:34.460]  Val: Oh, uh, so a guy named is a really good hacker named MG developed a really good demon seed is this sort of company he goes by demon seed and he uh great really good with encryption actually that's how I got to know him in 2016 I I heard is uh He gave like a lecture on his encryption. They was developing for he's trying to get people into it. But he was pretty good. It was like a Signal before Signal or around the same time Signal. What's going on? but was he was really good at making these sort of what do you call him like a USB killers or USB hacks?
[09:11.500]  Val: So if someone comes over hey, David, can I can I use your uh charger to charge up my iPhone? And you're like, oh, yeah, here you go and you give him one of the chargers the cords And he plugs it in and the cord just sort of uh It does a um, it does acquisition immediately of all the data on your phone. Well, not all the data, but the high-value data. Important stuff and the best part about about it is that it's it's a web server. So you can log in to the damn cord and you can deliver payloads. You can do whatever, you know
[09:45.180]  Ko: There's a USB cable that will automatically dump an entire phone. 
Val: Yeah. Yeah, it's cool, huh?
[09:51.820]  Ko: It's actually well, it's interesting. I based on what I know of most phones I would say that the claim sounds a little bit excessive. I mean, there's some stuff you can
[10:06.220]  Val: Well, I'll tell you what come over come over to my house and charge your phone and I'll show you
Ko: Well I'd probably bring a dummy phone to charge it
[10:15.420]  Val: It's a I know it's a joke. I'm saying I'll show you that I'll show you I'll do it. I'll show you a thing for it, but I have to, I have
[10:26.140]  Val: Yes, yes, it's called uh because oh MG is the the guy's name and he just put it o in front of it. So it's like, oh my god, you know OMG. Yeah, but I have to tweak it because the way it's sort of sold. Honestly, it's there's some like, uh, it's a little like a miss uh miss not miss no, It's a miss uh. It's bad advertising because it sort of alludes to the fact that it will dump the whole fucking thing from the phone. But really when you get it and you're like, what is this you unbox it? It's really the opposite. It's for the computer.
[10:58.780]  Ko: So, uh, computer's a little different than a phone. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, I know the claim that you can just plug a phone in and it'll dump everything. But that's where I went there something I really I'm like, I really got a loot which is possible, I would, I'll be very suspicious if it actually worked. 
Val: Well, that's what I'm telling you. That's where I come in
[11:20.780]  Val: And I did my a little tweak on it. So I make it work like it's supposed to work, like I thought it was going to work And it's not as hard as you think because uh one you always do is get by the passcode and remember. These are for Macs mostly and for iPhone's So the passcode once you can get past that it's easy because you just trick it into thinking it's an iPhone. It's not that hard. It's if it thinks if it thinks it's iTunes passcode, but-- Sorry?
[11:47.100]  Ko: Again, like that's what I mean is like there's there's a lot of other steps that need to happen. Like the passcode is the very first hurdle you have to right get past exactly. Well, you what what idiot is gonna put their passcode in after they plug it into.
[12:00.540]  Val: No, no, no, no. Of course, but no, no what the thing is you nowadays you have to hit trust this computer or trust this phone, right?
[12:09.340]  Ko: Right
[12:09.820]  Val: So if you can already if the if the if you can emulate emulate the iTunes software. Okay, which is just iTunes and it's already pretty public you can find that that it's you emulate that and so the computer believes that you've already accepted this handshake. This handshake has been stored in somewhere in a cookie somewhere in there or a token or whatever the fuck it sees they do. It's actually a token. Then it's then it's okay, then you can get bypass the passcode, you know. And what you can get from another payload called lock scream.
[12:47.660]  Val: But somebody developed a while ago is very good, is you can get the actual passcode so it'll it'll give you the passcode it gets into that little, you know, what's that thing every iPhone has it's like a it's like a it's just a little file. I can't remember name
Ko: Lock file
[13:02.620]  Val: Yeah, I think there you go lock file. So you just basically gets a lock file. Which is why it's called lock scream, you know. And so you incorporate that is payload number one and then the second one you get the credentials with the you know, what's beautiful is I don't have to write anything. You just copy paste other people's scripts. So and there's 12 different slots and banks for payloads. It's really quite a cool thing.
[13:27.580]  Val: So anyway, I'm trying to I told this to my private investigator. He's like really I said, yeah, he's like, okay Val. You know what I got I'll tell you what I'll do. I'm gonna work for you guys and you don't have to pay me. I just want a one painting from Marie. You know, and I want you to hook me up with one of these cords and a phone. Uh, you know, you know the phones that what do you call them the you can I can with blue dirt via bluetooth. Or via the RFID chip or both I put my phone next to yours and it pulls all the data. What do you call that?
[14:01.580]  Ko: Well, I mean to get that claim is also very... I've heard and I've seen some stuff, but it's not as simple as like I put my phone next to yours and it steals everything
[14:13.820]  Val: Well, you then you are buddy you're you are out of the loop because I have seen those and they are available and they do work and funny enough the only the last time I saw it was my friend Sydney. It was getting divorced and her husband had that had that phone and he uh, he pulled all her data out and it was really quite amazing and that was in 2015.
[14:35.340]  Val: But at that time it took 30 minutes, so he had to leave. His phone on top of hers for 30 minutes. So that was the only problem was getting that to happen for 30 minutes.
[14:43.660]  Val: But nowadays you don't have to have it on top of the other phone. It can be within about one the six half a foot radius. So that's why I suspect RFID is the new way it's going in not bluetooth. Because you know, that's the only you can bluetooth you can go you know pretty far, but RFID you've got to be right there, you know. Still it's a lot of there's still a lot of data to pull over um that channel. I mean that handshake you can't handle much. That's why they only send out like a couple numbers. You know, it's like call and response with something and then decrypt it on RFID. So that's why you can only get the numbers and you can get um the messages are too big.
[15:23.100]  Ko: You're not getting the full dump for the phone. Well, you're getting call logs or maybe messages or something
[15:28.620]  Val: Well, no, no, that's the thing at first you're not getting the full dump, but then you can turn on the bluetooth. Okay, and from the bluetooth you'll get the full dump. So the malware will will do will have a two-step basically two prong attack.
[15:44.140]  Ko: How does it uh download the malware onto the victim phone 
Val: from the bluetooth connection
[15:49.660]  Ko: But how does it initiate a bluetooth connection without a handshake?
[15:53.260]  Val: Well, it's remember how you it's you know how like a vpn won't let you turn off the wi-fi. There's a little trick in in apple that just has that stupid. Some there's the bluetooth the vpn people figured out first. It's a little hack. It's not even a hack. It's just built into the code um, so if you have a... Every time the user turns it off it goes the root turns it back on. So and you can do that for the for that toggle that button which means you can do it for every other toggle button
[16:21.820]  Ko: Wait, so how does so there's a signal that sends to the victim phone? Victim phone then accepts this bluetooth connection without validation.
Val: No. No. No. No the the signal the signal is sent through rfid chip
[16:36.780]  Val: or for the rfid frequency um, and there's a second frequency which is not rfid, but it's like ic or is uh our
[16:46.140]  Val: There's a third one in there too. That's involved and those two
[16:49.740]  Val: Uh
[16:51.740]  Val: Shit, it's it's the credit card. What do credit cards use again?
Ko: NFC
[16:55.260]  Val: Yes, nfc. You're right. nfc rfid and fc. So I think it's nfc that does the initial handshake. Sorry. Then rfid and then bluetooth. But at the end of the day it's always bluetooth that pulls the data because that is the fastest way to do it. And the way it tricks the into the authentication. Is that it deauths first everything around it and then reauth on the uh on the up on the reauth. There's somehow is uh, I don't I'm not sure exactly. I'm like, I'm not a coder, but I can take a look at it and see what it is, but I don't know. Like that's where I can tell you I don't know but it just does it and I think it has to do with the root if you if you can root it um, you can via bluetooth
[17:40.860]  Ko: [unintelligible] always on Android because uh, ios
[17:44.300]  Val: Yeah, no
Ko: I dunno Val, you're trying some pretty wide claims here
[17:52.300]  Val: Dude you got to get in the field more man. I'm telling you, Sydney would never use anything but an iPhone. She's one of those people, you know. Um, since whatever whatever iPhone's became a status symbol. She's she's one of those in the in the husband is a billionaire. So he has no... He has unlimited access to RND.
[18:11.420]  Ko: Okay, 
Val: so remember that too. Yeah
[18:14.940]  Ko: I don't anyway, I don't know whatever.
[18:17.820]  Val: The reason I say that is because um with unlimited access you can hire a team of hackers to do this for you. But he didn't need to do that you can you can buy one.
Ko: you realize that I I do pen testing like I
[18:29.980]  Ko: Whatever it doesn't 
Val: no, no. I'm not tell me you do pen testing
[18:33.580]  Ko: But whatever it is. 
Val: Tell me 
Ko: it's not it's not worth like trying to figure out like how this has worked
[18:40.140]  Val: I'd like to know. No, I like the questions because you're making me think. It's good. Usually I just do stuff by instinct and then
[18:49.980]  Ko: "You gotta get in the field." Yeah, whatever man, what... What I'm saying is like I think the claim that you're making might be conflated with other data that might also be present. There might be a lot of other things that also have to happen in order for this thing to work. 
Val: Well, he's not gonna look. We're not getting we're not getting photos. That's not happening
[19:06.540]  Val: All right, we're not getting photos and videos. We're getting messages
[19:09.420]  Ko: You get a full full everything on the phone. 
Val: That's a clone. 
Ko: That's a lot. That's different a lot of information
[19:16.060]  Val: Sorry, I misspoke. I misspoke. That's a that's a clone like a complete clone 
Ko: the reason why I know that that's not true
[19:21.980]  Ko: Is because just based on data throughput alone. Like you say you have a regular iPhone that's like 64 gigs. You know like 64 gigs with the data just transfer that data alone, not via either type wirelessly. I mean at best at best you're gonna get like 10 15 megabytes per second. And that's if you're like burning through it and you're like phone to phone. 10 to 15 megabytes per second think about that it takes forever to get 64 gigs. So if you thought that someone's just gonna like--
[19:53.340]  Val: Oh
[19:54.380]  Ko: And I'm gonna grab everything that's what I mean. It's like yeah, 
Val: what if it's the wi-fi that's almost impossible
[19:59.900]  Val: It must be the wi-fi. No, it's not it would be the wi-fi because if you can turn on the wi-fi and hotspot, hotspot the phone. 
Ko: Yeah, but like the phone can't
[20:10.220]  Ko: A phone doesn't have the native ability to transfer something wi-fi to wi-fi right like, think if you have that you have an iPhone right how many ways can you transfer data? You can airdrop it you can bluetooth it which is the same thing. You can transfer via wi-fi, but it has to have a specific protocol that allows it to transfer that data. So like anyway, 
Val: no, no
[20:31.340]  Ko: But that's what I'm saying. It's like when you make this claim like oh, I have enough to hold on like
[20:34.700]  Val: No, no, but it verifies if you what you just said was the missing the link because it just it verifies what I was telling you before it is, it has to be bluetooth because it is the airdrop the airdrop is the fastest way to do it. It's actually faster than wi-fi close differences. That's gotta be it.
Ko: airdropping something also has a bunch of other security protocols that hey, if someone's cracked it.
[20:55.420]  Ko: Maybe they have I mean there's always new things every day that I know I learned about
Val: Mm-hmm
[20:59.580]  Ko: But it seems... Here's the other thing is we get a lot of these claims and then we go look at it and it's fucking bullshit. And then total bullshit where someone is just scamming other pretend hackers. 
Val: I'm not telling you something I heard from somebody. This isn't like a
[21:16.140]  Val: Gossipy thing. I'm telling you something that I that I've seen and I know. You know, maybe I got scammed. Maybe someone pulled the wool over from my eyes or something. They use some other, you know, it's a good parlor trick. It's possible. But I don't I don't know. I'll just I look into it. I mean I will look at.
[21:30.700]  Ko: Here's the other thing too is like. Like I am interested in this stuff and the reason is because you know, we need to keep abreast of like what's the latest hack. What's the latest vulnerability and it's always changing but. You're realistically like this type of information if from an investigative standpoint isn't valuable to us unless someone's using it to do something bad something illegal like breaking into someone's phone is already illegal. But you know, it's like if a proof of concept is you're just like a whitehat hacker. You're trying to find vulnerabilities. Yeah, they do it all the time. They publish white papers and you know, we read them and we go to you know, trainings on them and things like that. But there's nothing illegal about that, right? So it's right while it's interesting. It's not
[22:12.540]  Val: It's only illegal if you use it. And by the way, I'm just this is a side adage for the main story I was telling you We just got stuck here because it's fun to talk shop for some for once in a while.
[22:22.620]  Val: But yeah, the main gist is that they wanted they they were interested in developing these things as a mass production kind of thing so, um, I got called into this meeting and uh and the lawyer was there. She wants to uh, either fund it. I wasn't quite sure what she wanted other than
Ko: [unintelligible] investigator's name?
[22:44.940]  Val: Um, yeah, why he's a good guy. Okay. Yeah Porter p o r t e r
[22:52.380]  Val: Order that last name. Yes, uh, uh, John. I don't know if it's an h or an n. I think it's I think it's John with an h. But he's a he's a good dude. Yeah, he has he owned a uh, he was sorry. He's the the warden. He was the warden of a of a prison out here. After that for a while too. No, he's an interesting guy. Very clever. 
Ko: He's a former Los Angeles county sheriff's officer.
Val: Bakersfield Bakersfield deputy deputy sheriff. And there was a time when there was constables in California. Is that correct? There's a constable And so back then he used to work in the constables office or something. I'm not exactly sure. I'll ask him. He's coming by today. And so he was interested. He knows nothing about technology
[23:38.220]  Val: So he was very interested in this. He said val if you can actually deliver these things. I know a thousand people that will spend a thousand dollars right now. I'm like, really? It's like, yeah, and like well, you can buy these online. I mean, if it was that there's that much of an audience for it. I mean, you think there'd be something. I'm like hotcakes in July. But they're not so
[23:57.580]  Ko: Okay, so John Porter. Uh, you said John Porter somehow introduced you to the lawyer, right? The Russian Armenian lawyer
[24:06.860]  Val: No, yes, he introduced me to the lawyer. Yes.
[24:10.060]  Ko: Okay, and what's what's the lawyer's name?
[24:12.540]  Val: The lawyer's name is Diana with a really, I don't I don't know her last name actually. I never asked. But let me see but the because she says here in the text the first message I have from her is Diana. The second one is hey it's Val and here's my number blah blah. So it was the introduction text and she never put give me her last name, but I will ask John today for the last name.
[24:38.460]  Ko: What's her phone number, I guess
[24:41.420]  Val: Um, again, I'm getting the same bullshit phone number. I'm getting a 310 400 4000
[24:48.380]  Ko: Okay, 
Val: yeah, it's a fake number
[24:51.660]  Val: She's somewhat of a prodigy. She was she skipped ahead and she went to college at USC at age 16. And in ninth grade they skipped her up a few classes three grades. And she was uh, she's a prodigy of some sort. Very
Ko: Diana went to USC
[25:10.780]  Val: She's 31. Uh, that's another interesting thing. She was it was all international. Uh, kind of you know, when you're spying, what do you do? What are those courses called international? communication is. You know the one every
Ko: So Diana is also a spy, is that?
[25:28.380]  Val: No, no, I'm not I'm just saying that what I heard from her when we went to the meeting. She told us a bit of her about her life story. And um, it was actually John that brought up the she jumped ahead. She's a prodigy and then she's filled it in by saying that she studied international communication international relations. Thank you. And I'm the one that said, oh, that's what you know. All the CIA guys study first and she could laugh and he was haha. And she's actually I was approached by them and they wrote me a letter and I said, oh, can I see it? And she did not show me the letter.
[25:58.860]  Val: Um asking me to work for them, but I said my real love was with the FBI. I really wanted to work with the FBI. I said, oh, that's interesting. And she said, yeah, but um, you know, I just went into law because it was easier or something like I don't know. It's a weird story so. Um, anyway, you asked I told you. That's all I I don't have a last name.
[26:19.260]  Ko: Diana, no last name. 31 years old, went to USC number. 310-400-4000.
[26:27.660]  Val: Yeah.
[26:28.860]  Ko: introduces you to uh, Arman Krboyan?
[26:35.020]  Val: Incorrect incorrect asks if I can help um ask if I can help her. But I don't can't tell you too much. I don't want to tell you too much here because I don't want to get you in trouble. So I was asked to help on a totally different thing because I believe this guy has some compromising videos of her, uh, you know doing uh things that people do.
[27:02.060]  Ko: And Krboyan has compromising videos of Diana. 
Val: Yeah
[27:07.180]  Ko: Okay. Okay, 
Val: Wants them deleted
[27:12.780]  Ko: Okay, so, Krboyan, I forget how to spell the crc. Oh. Krboyan compromising videos of Diana, but isn't Krboyan being represented by Diana or something like that.
[27:30.700]  Val: Well, it's apparently they fuck. Okay.
Ko: I got the insinuation. So he's got some video of her and him, I assume.
[27:46.700]  Val: I don't know. I haven't seen it yet, but I think it's them. Maybe there's someone else. I don't know but uh, okay.
[27:52.860]  Ko: Yeah, so. But then she wants them to delete it. So she called you.
[27:57.820]  Val: No, no, she's not calling me. She's not calling me. No, I was introduced for by Porter because Porter. Yeah, we went to meet him in a park where he was working a different case. He was protecting these this uh, a woman and her children in the park. um, some sort of gang thing. So it was a whole thing and then he said, you know what you guys why don't you come and have lunch with me and my friend and you should really get know her because she's someone you should know, you know. And this is called networking. It's like, oh, thanks John. He's a funny guy. And you know, she's a criminal defense lawyer and she's very interested in these cords that you were telling me about.
[28:34.860]  Val: I said, oh, okay. So Marie and I go over there for lunch and she does not cook lunch. But she did give us coffee, but we were there for hours talking. And she was very interested in financing these cords, but I have to deliver a working cord very soon. And uh, then she told me what she wanted from me. Right.
[28:58.460]  Ko: Okay, which is to delete these. But uh, of her that Krboyan has 
Val: videos. Yeah
[29:08.540]  Ko: Okay, and so Krboyan is, but she and she says he's an FSB officer. 
Val: She alluded to that
[29:17.500]  Val: Yes, she did not again. I told you earlier. She did not come out and say FSB officer.
[29:22.460]  Ko: How did she
[29:25.340]  Val: Um, because I asked. Um, when we spoke about because everything she said, um with the 16 phone calls. And I'm looking at everything. Oh, she's just your basic. Criminal defense attorney defending drug dealers, right? But then the guys said she says that he doesn't use drugs and doesn't doesn't uh, he's not a drug dealer. And then I'm like, well, why would he have 16 phones? I said, oh and I just sort of sometimes I can't really control what I say. Like a Tourette's but I don't have Tourette's and I said, oh FSB. And then everyone sort of laughs and suddenly I was like, who's what's FSB? Because he's a little too old to understand that they changed KGB to FSB.
[30:02.620]  Val: And then I'm like, oh, uh, and I started then she starts explaining, you know, she fills in my senses and then. Uh, she said something. That made it sort of click with me that it was FSB. And it was something that she so there's a hacker named Ruslan, you know Ruslan.
[30:22.140]  Ko: How do you spell Ruslan? 
Val: R U S L A N
[30:26.940]  Ko: Can't say that, no.
[30:28.060]  Val: Oh, man. Yeah, you are you're a bit out there about touch buddy. Sorry, but this guy Ruslan
[30:34.700]  Ko: You want me to hang up man? Like every time. I can't know everything in the fucking world, man.
Val: I'm busting your balls. Relax. I'm busting your balls, man
[30:42.220]  Ko: Like every time you know about OMG Cords, man, I don't know about fucking on.
[30:45.580]  Val: Ah, dude, I'm busting your balls. Relax. Relax. You don't have a partner to bust balls with it's fun. Yes, look, you got this guy Ruslan. He's a russian hacker and he's a pretty fucking good by the way. He's one of the best and he uh, I don't know exactly. I'll fan but if I get my computer pull it off. He was working. She was handling his case and uh. Shit, where's my computer here? If she was handling his case and she was working out a deal over he was going to hand himself over to the FBI.
[31:16.380]  Val: And because this is your specialty. So that's what I'm telling you and at the very last day. Uh, he's supposed to show up to court and turn himself in and get some sort of uh suspended sentence or something some sort of deal. He got on it was well, we don't she didn't say for sure. It was a plane but he left the country and went to Kiev on that very same day. And everyone went to court and we're waiting for him for a while a long time.
[31:44.540]  Val: When he uh, I think called from a some either a plane or a boat or something. Somehow somehow he got to the Ukraine. Is it his greatest career?
