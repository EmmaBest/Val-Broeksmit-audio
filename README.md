# Val-Broeksmit-FBI-audio

Audio files and transcripts of FBI informant [Val Broeksmit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Broeksmit) meeting with and speaking to FBI agents. 

## As-is
 * The [Val vs Andrew Dowling PT1  DKO’d](https://github.com/EmmaBest/Val-Broeksmit-FBI-audio/blob/main/audio/Val%20vs%20Andrew%20Dowling%20PT1%20%20DKO%E2%80%99d.m4a) file was corrupt in the original Zip file I was sent, and is provided as-is.
 * The NYT audio files were too large to upload to GitHub, so they were split evenly by time. The original versions were uploaded as [podcasts](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thenewenthusiasts/) before being downloaded again.

# Transcription process

 1. The original transcripts were created using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). These are useful for searching, but contain numerous errors. These versions are being provided **as-is** and for reference only.
 2. Large portions of [Kofbico PY2](https://github.com/EmmaBest/Val-Broeksmit-FBI-audio/blob/main/audio/Kofbico%20PY2.m4a) were manually corrected using [oTranscribe](https://oTranscribe.com). However, I am not a transcriber and these versions may still contain errors. 
 3. Other transcripts were manually corrected the same way. Some are still pending.
 4. (Pending) The corrected transcripts should then be edited to be more readable. i.e. combining multiple lines from a single speaker into one paragraph, etc.
