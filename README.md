# Val-Broeksmit-FBI-audio

Audio files and transcripts of FBI informant [Val Broeksmit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Broeksmit) meeting with and speaking to FBI agents. 

## Note
The [Val vs Andrew Dowling PT1  DKOâ€™d](https://github.com/EmmaBest/Val-Broeksmit-FBI-audio/blob/main/audio/Val%20vs%20Andrew%20Dowling%20PT1%20%20DKO%E2%80%99d.m4a) file was corrupt in the original Zip file I was sent, and is provided as-is.

# Transcription process

 1. The original transcripts were created using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). These are useful for searching, but contain numerous errors. These versions are being provided **as-is** and for reference only.
 2. Large portions of [Kofbico PY2](https://github.com/EmmaBest/Val-Broeksmit-FBI-audio/blob/main/audio/Kofbico%20PY2.m4a) were manually corrected using [oTranscribe](https://oTranscribe.com). However, I am not a transcriber and these versions may still contain errors. 
 3. (Pending) The corrected transcripts should then be edited to be more readable. i.e. combining multiple lines from a single speaker into one paragraph, etc.
