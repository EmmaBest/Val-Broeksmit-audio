[09:39.000]  Fed: Look at it.
[09:40.000]  Val: Do your parents...
[09:41.000]  Fed: Is that the one staff that comes down?
[09:43.000]  Val: Oh, my God. There was some, but not for LA.
[09:46.000]  Fed: Okay.

[10:07.000]  Fed: I need a physical ID, unless you guys are okay with that.
[10:12.000]  Val: This is actually my fault because I lost my drivers license a few days ago. I don't know where it is. It's in a book. It's on my bookshelf.

[13:15.000]  Val: Sorry?
[13:16.000]  Fed: This is new.
[13:17.000]  Val: It's new, huh?
[13:18.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[13:19.000]  Val: That's why.

[14:15.000]  Val: Eight.
[14:16.000]  Fed: Which languages?
[14:18.000]  Val: Oh, uh, uh, English, I know, right? English, Swiss, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian.
[14:27.000]  Fed: Huh?
[14:28.000]  Val: And I think she – uh, Chinese.

[14:54.000]  Fed: Cheers.
[14:55.000]  Fed: Can you see my partner?
[14:56.000]  Val: Thanks.
[15:12.000]  Val: Does everyone make fun? [???]
[15:14.000]  Fed: Um...
[15:15.000]  Val: Really, huh?
[15:16.000]  Fed: Yeah, usually you'll feel comfortable here because of your game console.
[15:20.000]  Val: Oh, dang it.
[15:21.000]  Fed: You know, I get to meet about a fun man or two different people.
[15:28.000]  Val: I remember this tenth floor. I handed my stuff, we go to another one over there.
[15:32.000]  Fed: Exactly, same thing. And then what we just handled over there used to be handled on the tenth floor.
[15:38.000]  Val: Yeah.
[15:39.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[15:40.000]  Val: So that girl's no longer working here? It's a floor lady?
[15:43.000]  Fed: Oh, it's always changing.
[15:44.000]  Val: She's so nice. Super nice.
[15:46.000]  Fed: Oh, that could be it.
[15:48.000]  Val: Yeah. Still not. Are you guys there? So, some of you are special agents?
[15:55.000]  Fed: Yep.
[15:56.000]  Val: And you are DC3?
[15:58.000]  Fed: Uh, I'm not... I'm not in LA. You know, I'm not part of their...
[16:02.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[16:03.000]  Fed: Their hierarchy. No, I'm not.
[16:05.000]  Val: It's not the... It's the general hierarchy. In New York. It's everything but Russia.
[16:11.000]  Fed: DC3. Yeah, so it usually doesn't work in the same way.
[16:14.000]  Val: Oh.
[16:15.000]  Fed: Yeah. So different...
[16:17.000]  Fed: Different to a lot of different things.
[16:20.000]  Val: Cool. Oh, there. I see what you're saying.
[16:23.000]  Fed: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You remember that?
[16:26.000]  Val: I do. Oh, wait.
[16:31.000]  Val: It's my natural that's supposed to...
[16:33.000]  Fed: Oh, right.
[16:36.000]  Val: Thanks. Okay.
[16:51.000]  Val: Did you get a chance to... There were four lights. Clever. I liked it. I liked it.
[16:57.000]  Fed: I'd love you get the reference.
[16:58.000]  Val: Oh, I got it. I got it.
[17:00.000]  Fed: That's what it is. That's supposed to make a random number.
[17:03.000]  Val: Yeah, that's good.
[17:04.000]  Fed: One, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.
[17:06.000]  Val: I was surprised you spelled out four, though.
[17:08.000]  Fed: Oh, I think... Because I never thought we'd take anything.
[17:11.000]  Val: Oh, it was? Oh, okay.
[17:13.000]  Fed: Yeah, that's how it is.
[17:14.000]  Val: It's good. Well, you read the call of Winston. It's from Winston. And he's being tortured.
[17:19.000]  Fed: Right.
[17:20.000]  Val: Writing in the floor. It's a portless floor. A two-plus-two-plus-four.
[17:24.000]  Fed: Interesting. No. That's the one where there are five lights. And he makes Picard saying that there are four.
[17:31.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[17:32.000]  Fed: He makes them say that there are five lights.
[17:34.000]  Val: I know, but that's... But it's taken from 1984?
[17:37.000]  Fed: Yes.
[17:46.000]  Val: Nice. Cool.
[17:57.000]  Fed: He probably grabbed all the stuff. Okay.
[18:02.000]  Fed: Is there another room?
[18:03.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[18:04.000]  Val: I think I might have a bigger...
[18:06.000]  Fed: No, it's okay.
[18:34.000]  Fed: Well, this is... This is Patty
[18:36.000]  Val: Patty? How do you do it? Nice to meet you.
[18:39.000]  Fed: Can I take a hand?
[18:40.000]  Fed: Yeah, I know, it's a...
[18:41.000]  Val: The virtual way, right?
[18:42.000]  Fed: Sure, sure.
[18:43.000]  Val: Patty, are you from Houston as well?
[18:45.000]  Fed: No.
[18:46.000]  Val: LA? From LA. Okay.
[18:49.000]  Fed: How do you like your coffee?
[18:50.000]  Val: Lots of milk sugar.
[18:51.000]  Fed: Milk sugar?
[18:52.000]  Val: Yes, please. Can I take off my mask?
[18:55.000]  Fed: Good.
[18:56.000]  Val: We casual here?
[18:57.000]  Fed: Okay.
[18:58.000]  Fed: I have one.
[19:00.000]  Fed: Take it really.
[19:03.000]  Val: I just can't, it fogs up my glasses.
[19:05.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[19:06.000]  Val: You do it with your fogger.
[19:08.000]  Fed: I know.
[19:09.000]  Val: You know?
[19:10.000]  Fed: I've got some people with a mask.
[19:12.000]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[19:13.000]  Fed: I've got a clear one.
[19:14.000]  Fed: Yeah, like a face shield.
[19:15.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[19:16.000]  Fed: But now they're saying,
[19:21.000]  Val: Do you need both of them?
[19:23.000]  Fed: I don't know.
[19:30.000]  Val: Believe it or not, Russia just did the other vaccine yesterday.
[19:33.000]  Fed: Of course they did.
[19:34.000]  Fed: I saw that.
[19:35.000]  Fed: I saw that too, right?
[19:37.000]  Val: It's propaganda. It's propaganda.
[19:42.000]  Fed: Oh, I'm sure.
[19:43.000]  Fed: I saw that too.
[19:44.000]  Fed: Thank you.
[19:46.000]  Val: Good to [unintelligible]
[19:48.000]  Val: So I'm so excited to hear what this is about.
[19:50.000]  Fed: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:51.000]  Val: I don't think I can take it anymore. It's like so thrilling. I've got four guesses. Can I guess?
[19:56.000]  Fed: Sure, you can guess it.
[19:57.000]  Val: Okay. Does it have to do... I don't think it has to do with things.
[20:00.000]  Fed: It [unintelligible] have to tell you. If that makes you feel any better.
[20:02.000]  Val: That's not helpful. All right, let me see if I can read you. Based on my guesses. I don't think it's related to banking.
[20:10.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:11.000]  Val: Okay. I think it's related to hacking.
[20:13.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:14.000]  Val: I think it has something to do with Emma.
[20:16.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:17.000]  Val: How am I? I'm close? I couldn't read you. Well, no, you're getting a different one the first time. Your eyes went to the right. Usually, eyes up to the right, you're creating something. Down to the left, it acts as a memory.
[20:30.000]  Fed: So, everything I've read and studied about that is actually bullshit.
[20:34.000]  Val: It is bullshit. You've got to know the person who does that. It is true. You've got to get a baseline with the person first.
[20:38.000]  Fed: Whatever.
[20:39.000]  Val: It's not like global.
[20:40.000]  Fed: Because you think about it, if that was true.
[20:42.000]  Val: Yeah.
[20:43.000]  Fed: Every poker tournament you'd be able to find out immediately who's blocking the business.
[20:46.000]  Val: That's true. That's true.
[20:48.000]  Fed: Because detection of deception is incredibly difficult, unfortunately.
[20:51.000]  Val: Well, do you think so? I think it's pretty easy.
[20:55.000]  Fed: It's a research issue.
[20:57.000]  Val: If you know how you are deceptive, then you will know how someone else is deceptive. Except for certain type.
[21:03.000]  Fed: I would have to see.
[21:05.000]  Fed: So, there's different types of liars, too. There's Machiavellian liars, who will lie just a lot. They'll lie because that's just what they did every single day of their life.
[21:12.000]  Val: Trump.
[21:13.000]  Fed: Then, on the other side of the world, there's what you can call the Catholic school boy or girl. They've grown up with a fear of lying, where anytime they lie, they're like, I just said that my name is David. What does he think my name is?
[21:27.000]  Val: The shame associated with guilt.
[21:28.000]  Fed: So, those are, yeah, exactly. So, those are two very distinctly different types of liars who lie very distinctly different.
[21:35.000]  Fed: So, for example, the Machiavellian liars is harder to detect on the line.
[21:39.000]  Val: Because it's constant lines. There's no baseline.
[21:41.000]  Fed: And the opposite would be the Catholic school boy or girl is harder to detect because they're constantly triggering. Well, they honestly think that they're lying about something even when they're not.
[21:51.000]  Val: What about the sort of desperate liars that are trying to stay alive?
[21:56.000]  Fed: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot. That's what it means. I've read a couple books on it, and we've taken a couple classes.
[22:00.000]  Val: Yeah, that's what I was curious about in your classes. Do they teach that? Do they teach at Quantico or something?
[22:06.000]  Fed: Like, that's a thing that I'm sure can be used to see someone's life and there are things that we'll do. And there's things that I do as part of my normal daily life.
[22:16.000]  Val: Yeah. Well, what I do is I ask you questions. I know. I'll ask you what's your name when it's your birthday, because they're at low. And then I'll see how you react to the honest question. And then I'll ask you something I know you don't know, and I'll see how you react to that. And that's how I establish a baseline. That's my method, though.
[22:31.000]  Fed: That's a good thing.
[22:32.000]  Val: That's how I do it. What about you?
[22:34.000]  Fed: You had polygraph, huh?
[22:35.000]  Val: What's a polygraph? No, no, I'm not. I'm not. I'm never taking polygraph. I would like to if you guys [hook me up] It'd be fun. But no, I just, you know, I like people. Well, actually, I hate people, but I like... I love and I hate people, but I like to study things. I don't know.
[22:54.000]  Fed: Very cool. Very cool. That was nice of you,we're going to bring you down here.
[22:59.000]  [unintelligible]
[23:00.000]  Fed: if you want to head back out or something.
[23:01.000]  Val: I'm sorry?
[23:02.000]  Fed: Do you have to give her a call?
[23:03.000]  Val: No, it's just got to work at one. So she said, is you going to go out and just to write this letter to the judge? Yeah. Well, he got screwed over by his fucking lawyer. It's got to be Mike Kretzmer.
[23:13.000]  Fed: Mm-hmm.
[23:14.000]  Val: He went so far as to... He emailed Jim and Tammy saying, I am Val's counsel. I am Val's attorney.
[23:23.000]  Fed: Interesting. Yeah, because I saw your text this morning.
[23:26.000]  Val: I saw that.
[23:27.000]  Fed: You know, he said he'd like to represent you, but he's not, so...
[23:30.000]  Val: Yeah, we had to fire him. Yeah. He was very condescending. And there's something really wrong. You see, I thought it was in L.A. I mean, it's like a mafia. They know each other and they do whatever the other person says. It's very disturbing. They don't want to mess it up however you want, but you have to have it.
[23:53.000]  Val: Well, I tried to guess what this is all about.
[23:55.000]  Val: It's nothing to do with banking.
[23:57.000]  Fed: Okay.
[23:58.000]  Val: And I think that's something to do with hacking.
[24:00.000]  Val: And her name is Emma.
[24:02.000]  Fed: Oh, look.
[24:03.000]  Fed: I think I got the honor of being here.
[24:08.000]  Fed: Well, I mean, to the third guess.
[24:09.000]  Okay.
[24:10.000]  No, no, no.
[24:11.000]  Fed: Another guest.
[24:12.000]  Interesting.
[24:16.000]  Fed: Who's the third guest?
[24:18.000]  Fed: I thought you said he had four guesses.
[24:19.000]  Val: No, no, no.
[24:24.000]  Val: It's a match. It's a match. It's a problem.
[24:27.000]  Fed: Cool. I guess, so, what we're here for is mainly to see how we can help you, right? Because we need to find out. So, you and I have talked, I've talked with Patty and Boeing about it lately, but you should probably rehash a little bit about what the situation is right now, how the hearing went, and everything else. Just make sure that we're all on the same page. Because like I told you,like, if we are going to be able to help, we have to know how we can help and how best to help you.
[24:54.000]  Val: Okay.
[24:55.000]  Fed: That way, we can go forward. But at the same time, if you're going to help us, you also have to know, okay, well, is this going to be dependent on something else?
[25:01.000]  Val: Right. Well, that's why, why don't you just tell me first what you want. And then I'll go from there.
[25:06.000]  Fed: Well, I mean, the thing is like, I'm not going to tell you what exactly we want. I'm telling you that right now.
[25:11.000]  Val: I've already told you, on the phone, I'm giving you my word, because you, Tim and Jami, recommended you. I said, I'll help you if you need my help. No matter what. Even if it's, even if it's not anything related to you helping me, I will help you the best in my ability. Okay. Just because of Tim and Jami, because I take, their word is very, they carry a lot with me. It goes far with me. So I've already told you that, so I'll stick with that. You don't have to worry about anything too transactional with me right now. Okay. If you guys are coming out here to help me, that's great.
[25:41.000]  Fed: Okay.
[25:42.000]  Val: I'll tell you, what do you need to know? The whole story from the beginning?
[25:45.000]  Fed: Yep.
[25:46.000] Fed: [unintelligible]
[25:51.000]  Val: I don't even know where to start
[25:52.000]  Fed: from the beginning.
[25:55.000]  Val: So, you don't know my story though. It doesn't really matter, does it? Um. You can't even trust it. You can't even trust it. Oh, please don't read it. David Enrich's article. It's terrible. Okay. Marie and I metbecause I thought she was a spy for my mom, and I thought she was spying on me.
