[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:03.960]  Val: Here, I'll give you a quick peep.
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:06.080]  Val: This is what it's like, you can scroll around.
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:08.720]  Val: It's not that, it's not a cool, great, crazy data
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:11.080]  Val: that I keep, it's not what you think.
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:11.920]  Fed: Cool.
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:23.000]  Fed: Doc Rockett
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:23.840]  Val: What's wrong?

[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:25.560]  Fed: Doc Rockett

[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:27.600]  Fed: I assume these are not like real people, right?
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:28.920]  Val: No, they're not real people.
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:31.480]  Fed: I mean, they're not their real names.
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:34.480]  Val: Some of them, I mean, I use my real name.
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:35.480]  Fed: That's your friend.
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:36.760]  Val: I use his real name.
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:37.600]  Fed: Oh.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:39.360]  Val: I think Barrett uses his real name.
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:42.240]  Val: Conlon, I don't know, kind of, Doc Rockett is a,
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:44.840]  Val: I can't remember, I used to read through it again.
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:46.240]  Val: I used to know what everybody was, but.
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:47.920]  Fed: He's too many secrets, you know?
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:50.080]  Val: Oh, that guy's great, yeah, I do.
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:53.880]  Val: He doesn't do anything illegal.
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:56.240]  Val: He's like, he's just like a researcher.
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:57.640]  Val: He's not even that good.
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:55:59.360]  Val: He's got a couple of databases in there.
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:01.240]  Val: He's just very loyal and helpful.
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:03.880]  Val: So if anyone needs my help, I'll do that.
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.520]  Val: Kind of nice thing.
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.920]  Fed: So there are no film crews outside,
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:08.760]  Fed: but you never know.
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:11.640]  Fed: They could show up to your comfort level.
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:12.480]  Val: Okay, let's go.
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:15.160]  Fed: At the same time, the protest is like
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:17.920]  Fed: about salons wanting to open.
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:19.040]  Val:  That's what, salons?
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:20.240]  Fed: Yeah, like salons.
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:21.560]  Val: Okay.
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:22.400]  Val: Cool.
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:23.240]  Val: Let's join.
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:24.240]  Fed: A bit of a carry.
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:26.440]  Fed: Oh, that's what we really did there.
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:27.760]  Fed: Oh, thank you.
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:30.040]  Val: That was pretty good, though.
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:31.560]  Val: I mean, I give you credit.
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:38.080]  Val: God, it's split ends.
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:39.400]  Val: Okay, there you go.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.440]  Val: So yeah, it's not that it's fun.
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:46.920]  Val: It's mostly just people yelling.
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:49.040]  Val: During like, you know, Joe,
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:50.520]  Val: I'm sure you know Joe Fionda.
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:53.080]  Fed: Who's Joe Fionda?
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:55.040]  Val: Joe is like, what's his name?
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:56.440]  Val: Sub-Zero?
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:57.360]  Val: Sub-Zero?
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:58.200]  Val: Was his name?
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:00.040]  Val: I think in 2000.
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:01.520]  Fed: I'm talking about the mortal kombat character.
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:02.360]  Val: I don't know.
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:03.200]  Val: I don't know.
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:04.040]  Val: It's his name.
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:04.880]  Val: His alias.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:07.480]  Val: He's pretty, he's a clever guy.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:08.520]  Val: He was in the,
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:09.720]  Val: did you see the Hacker War film?
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:12.040]  Val: That's the film that women did with Barrett.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:16.720]  Val: It's basically the guy that's talking all the time.
[02:57:16.720 --> 02:57:18.920]  Val: And wearing a suit, that guy.
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.000]  Fed: Okay.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.040]  Fed: Joe, is he a hacker?
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:24.920]  Val: I think, yeah, he's like a, yeah.
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:25.880]  Fed: Okay.
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:27.520]  Fed: So he's like, he's friends with Barrett.
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:28.920]  Fed: Is that how he got in the group?
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:31.320]  Val: Yeah, these old friends of Barrett.
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:32.160]  Fed: Cool.
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:35.240]  Val: He's one of his old friends of Barrett, man.
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:36.960]  Fed: So what did Joe do?
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.280]  Val: Joe, I'm not quite sure.
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:40.360]  Val: I think he goes cycling a lot.
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:43.880]  Val: He spends most of his time cycling
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:44.720]  Val: during the year.
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:47.600]  Val: He's a, everyone,
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:49.880]  Val: but these guys are fairly activism, you know,
[02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:52.200]  Val: based, which is great and all.
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:54.880]  Val: I'm not really a, you know,
[02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:57.320]  Val: I mean, I guess I don't believe anything that strongly
[02:57:57.320 --> 02:57:59.080]  Val: to go out and carry a sign.
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:57:59.920]  Fed: Sure.
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:01.880]  Val: But I'm sure, you know,
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:06.600]  Val: I mean, if someone DCFS right now,
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:08.520]  Val: of course, I think I would probably carry a sign.
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:11.000]  Val: So I'm like, it hasn't hit me personally yet.
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:14.960]  Fed: I mean, that's a really popular corner.
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:15.800]  Val: Yeah, wow.
[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:17.040]  Fed: Just because it's like one of the,
[02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:17.880]  Fed: you hear it over there.
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:19.200]  Val: Yeah, this would be okay.
[02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:21.960]  Val: It's really far away.
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:32.920]  Fed: I can push a little bit over there.
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:33.760]  Val: Sure.
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:36.600]  Val: Oh, really?
[02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:37.440]  Val: Oh, man.
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:42.400]  Val: So, yeah, I mean, just like everyone,
[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:43.520]  Val: the people who use their real names
[02:58:43.520 --> 02:58:46.080]  Val: really aren't afraid of the guy finding out.
[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:48.120]  Val: So, I'm sure you, yeah.
[02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:53.600]  Val: But the, yeah, there was another interesting thing.
[02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:56.880]  Val: God, I can't remember why they said Ko.
[02:58:57.160 --> 02:58:59.000]  Val: I'm running to show you the thing.
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:00.320]  Fed: I can almost guarantee you.
[02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:02.840]  Fed: It's not me, because I'm not that important.
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:04.800]  Val: No, but you were from Houston,
[02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:06.800]  Val: and Barrett said it was a guy from Houston
[02:59:06.800 --> 02:59:08.680]  Val: that called a friend of his
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:10.720]  Val: that was trying to infiltrate some group,
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:12.040]  Val: but he was on the wrong group.
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:14.040]  Val: I don't know exactly what happened.
[02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:15.200]  Val: We got a recording of the phone call.
[02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:16.520]  Val: I wanted to play back the phone call
[02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:18.640]  Val: to see if that was you talking to this other guy.
[02:59:18.640 --> 02:59:20.240]  Val: Not Barrett directly, but someone else.
[02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:22.040]  Fed: I would be interested if you got a recording
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:23.400]  Fed: of me talking to someone.
[02:59:23.400 --> 02:59:24.240]  Fed: I'd love to hear it..
[02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:29.280]  Val: Yeah, that's what ??? with Ko

[02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:32.880]  Val: Okay.
Fed: [unintelligible]
[02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:40.640]  Val: Now, could you, is it possible that,
[02:59:41.640 --> 02:59:46.640]  Val: is it possible to have this guy,
[02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:48.080]  Val: that you've done your research,
[02:59:48.080 --> 02:59:50.560]  Val: you probably understand that Steve is not a good guy?
[02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:51.400]  Fed: Who's Steve.
[02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:52.240]  Val: Steve Tolts?
[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:55.080]  Fed: You've posted here on Facebook.
[02:59:55.080 --> 02:59:58.880]  Val: Yeah, like he's not a stand-up guy.
[02:59:58.880 --> 02:59:59.720]  Val: He's not a,
[03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:04.960]  Val: you know the type that's run to mom and the scribbling.
[03:00:04.960 --> 03:00:05.960]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[03:00:08.480 --> 03:00:11.360]  Val: I think it's actually really become a threat
[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:15.320]  Val: to not only to Marlowe's update with the priest,
[03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:16.480]  the priest that's happening.
[03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:17.480]  Sure, no, I get it.
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:21.240]  Is it possible to have him deported?
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:23.080]  No.
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:27.520]  Australia.
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:34.680]  I went to a whole moral crisis.
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:36.920]  Did I do this or not?
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:39.400]  And I asked them, they said they'd do it.
[03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:40.240]  But then I said,
[03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:41.520]  but then all of a sudden I had this father,
[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:43.080]  I said, we're not going to do that tomorrow.
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:44.840]  That was the bottom line.
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:46.000]  But that was last year.
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  Yeah, that was last year.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.080]  But now everyone's really asking me,
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:51.040]  I know.
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:53.360]  Thank you.
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:54.360]  Thank you.
[03:00:54.360 --> 03:00:56.360]  Oh, good, good, good, good.
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:01.720]  You're welcome.
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:02.720]  I am the broker.
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:04.160]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:06.200]  You actually thought about it.
[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:08.640]  I was like, I'm not fucking one out.
[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:09.920]  I was like, you know,
[03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:12.040]  don't look at me, I did it on the right.
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:13.440]  I did, I did it on the right.
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:14.440]  That's all I got.
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:17.440]  It's a little bit economic.
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:20.440]  Because I was shopping in one town,
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:23.440]  and this was like twice that.
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:25.440]  I'm like, if you guys really eat it,
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:26.440]  I can eat for a week.
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:27.440]  That's true.
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:36.440]  Fed: I don't think you guys realize how nice this weather is
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:38.440]  Fed: for August, whatever.
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:40.440]  Val: Do you know Andrew?
[03:01:40.440 --> 03:01:41.440]  Fed: I don't like this weather.
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:43.440]  Val: Do you know Andrew?
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:44.440]  Val: Who's Andrew?
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:46.440]  Val: The one you pointed out, my friend.
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:47.440]  Fed: Your friend?
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:48.440]  Val: Yeah.
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:49.440]  Fed: I mean, you just told me about him,
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:50.440]  Fed: but I don't know.
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:52.440]  Val: Before I mentioned him.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:01:54.440]  Val: He's a good, interesting character.
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:55.440]  Fed: What's the deal?
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:56.440]  Val: He's a really good guy.
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:57.440]  Val: Good dude.
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:01:59.440]  Val: Do you remember, maybe,
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:03.440]  Val: probably in 2015 there was this article
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:06.440]  Val: in Bloomberg about
[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:08.440]  Val: if there was this company,
[03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:09.440]  Val: and it turned out later,
[03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:11.440]  Val: you find out articles later,
[03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:14.440]  Val: that it was a Russian company,
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:16.440]  Val: they created this big debts for people.
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:17.440]  Val: Someone would call you and say,
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:19.440]  Val: you owe us $2,000 a month,
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:21.440]  Val: and then you say,
[03:02:21.440 --> 03:02:22.440]  Val: you got this thing,
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:23.440]  Val: you forgot about it,
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:24.440]  Val: you should probably pay it.
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:26.440]  Val: Most people will pay that money.
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:29.440]  Val: If you will just create this big debt,
[03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:31.440]  Val: and it's a really fucking dollar,
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:33.440]  Val: and it's $1,000,000 a month.
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:35.440]  Val: So a lot of people would take advantage
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:36.440]  Val: and people would just be doing that.
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:38.440]  Val: And they'd try to get it to Andrews.
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:39.440]  Val: They wouldn't call Andrew,
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:41.440]  Val: and they'd say, you owe us $5,000,
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:42.440]  Val: we're a combination of debts,
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:43.440]  Val: and he'd say,
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:44.440]  Val: No I don't,
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:45.440]  Val: I remember paying that back,
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:47.440]  Val: ???
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:49.440]  Val: So he starts fighting and arguing with this guy,
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:51.440]  Val: until the guy threatens to go
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:53.440]  Val: and rape his wife.
[03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:54.440]  Val: Like, totally possible,
[03:02:54.440 --> 03:02:55.440]  Val: and Andrew said,
[03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:56.440]  Val: that's it.
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:02:58.440]  Val: So he starts doing like,
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:02:59.440]  Val: he's now,
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:02.440]  Val: he's the Liam Neeson thing,
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:04.440]  Val: I have three,
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:05.440]  Val: you know,
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:07.440]  Val: a few good things,
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:08.440]  Val: whatever the line is.
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:09.440]  Val: And that's what he does.
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:10.440]  Val: So you reverse engineers,
[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:11.440]  Val: it's brilliant what he did,
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:12.440]  Val: I love it.
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:13.440]  Val: Reverse engineers,
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:14.440]  Val: everyone that's called him,
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:15.440]  Val: and looks him up,
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:16.440]  Val: there's all the background on them,
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:19.440]  Val: gets them to give up more information on their,
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:21.440]  Val: just like you could do in any case.
[03:03:21.440 --> 03:03:22.440]  Val: You know,
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:23.440]  Val: give information to the guy at mob,
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:24.440]  Val: and the hierarchy,
[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:26.440]  Val: all the way up to Weldon,
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:27.440]  Val: the congressman,
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:29.440]  Val: was he a senator or congressman?
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:31.440]  Fed: Well, I'm a senator or something.
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:32.440]  Val: Is he Weldon?
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:33.440]  Val: No,
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:34.440]  Val: Josh Weldon,
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:36.440]  Val: or is he something Weldon?
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:37.440]  Val: Yeah, man,
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:38.440]  Fed: I don't know all the senators
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.440]  Fed: and representatives,
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:40.440]  Fed: so I'm a bad,
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:41.440]  Fed: he's an ???
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:42.440]  Fed: But,
[03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:43.440]  Val: I mean,
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:44.440]  Val: he might be,
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:45.440]  Val: he might be actually,
[03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:46.440]  Fed: I know he's a congressman person,
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:47.440]  Fed: but that's about the extent of my knowledge
[03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:48.440]  Fed: I know.
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:49.440]  Val: Yeah,
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:50.440]  Val: but he's in bed with a lot of,
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:51.440]  Val: the Russian companies,
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:53.440]  Val: they're creating these fake debt companies,
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:55.440]  Val: and it's a really good story,
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:03:56.440]  Val: it's great articles,
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:57.440]  Val: and it's just sort of reverse engineers,
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:03:58.440]  Val: put some in jail,
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:00.440]  Val: and it's a good guy at the store.
[03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:01.440]  Val: It's very impressed.
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:02.440]  Fed: That's cool.
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:03.440]  Val: I mean,
[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:04.440]  Val: he found me,
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:05.440]  Val: he just wanted to know
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:06.440]  Val: if I had any data
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:07.440]  Val: on those people as well,
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.440]  Val: like,
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:09.440]  Val: I was looking for Weldon,
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:10.440]  Val: the Russians,
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:11.440]  Val: the Tudmento[???]
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:13.440]  Val: or some other guy,
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:15.440]  Val: and that's how we became friends.
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:16.440]  Val: He's a good guy.
[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:17.440]  Fed: That's cool.
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:19.440]  Val: I thought he was already working with you guys.
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:20.440]  Val: I'm pretty sure he was,
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:21.440]  Val: I thought he was CIA.
[03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:22.440]  Fed: Okay,
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:23.440]  Fed: I mean,
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:24.440]  Fed: so if he was CIA then,
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:25.440]  Fed: I don't think he would.
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:26.440]  Val: That's what I thought.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:27.440]  Val: I don't know.
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:28.440]  Fed: Have you ever met him
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:29.440]  Fed: like,
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:30.440]  Fed: okay.
[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:31.440]  Val: Yeah,
[03:04:31.440 --> 03:04:32.440]  Val: he came out to visit.
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:33.440]  Fed: I don't know,
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:35.440]  Fed: do you think he'd want to work with us?
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:36.440]  Val: I think he would.
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:37.440]  Val: I think he would,
[03:04:37.440 --> 03:04:38.440]  Val: actually.
[03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:40.440]  Fed: Do you want to give me his contact information?
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:42.440]  Val: I think I'd have to ask him.
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:43.440]  Fed: Okay.
[03:04:43.440 --> 03:04:44.440]  Val: And then,
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:45.440]  Val: if he'd never have to,
[03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:46.440]  Val: I'd bring it up.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:47.440]  Val: Because I don't know,
[03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:48.440]  Val: he's like a,
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:49.440]  Val: like a really,
[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:52.440]  Val: he almost pisses me off,
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:53.440]  Val: he's like,
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:54.440]  Val: too good.
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:55.440]  Val: He's like,
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:04:57.440]  Val: he reminds me of my father in the sense
[03:04:57.440 --> 03:04:58.440]  Val: of his morality.
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:04:59.440]  Val: He's very,
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:00.440]  Val: very strong.
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:01.440]  Fed: That's good.
[03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:02.440]  Val: So that's the thing you guys like,
[03:05:02.440 --> 03:05:03.440]  Val: I mean,
[03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:04.440]  Val: you hire a lot of,
[03:05:04.440 --> 03:05:05.440]  Val: like,
[03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:06.440]  Val: Mormons, right?
[03:05:06.440 --> 03:05:07.440]  Val: So,
[03:05:07.440 --> 03:05:08.440]  Val: or is that the CIA?
[03:05:08.440 --> 03:05:10.440]  Val: Who's hiring all the Mormons?
[03:05:10.440 --> 03:05:12.440]  Fed: They're doing a lot of good things.
[03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:13.440]  Val: Yeah, okay.
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:14.440]  Fed: If they can pass the drug test,
[03:05:14.440 --> 03:05:15.440]  Fed: yeah.
[03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:16.440]  Val: Okay,
[03:05:16.440 --> 03:05:17.440]  Val: really the Mormons
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:18.440]  Val: can't pass the drug test?
[03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:19.440]  Val: That's great.
[03:05:19.440 --> 03:05:20.440]  Fed: Because they can't.
[03:05:20.440 --> 03:05:21.440]  Val: They cannot.
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:22.440]  Fed: No, they can't.
[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:23.440]  Fed: Oh, they can't,
[03:05:23.440 --> 03:05:24.440]  Val: right?
[03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:25.440]  Val: Yeah.
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:26.440]  Val: Okay,
[03:05:26.440 --> 03:05:27.440]  Val: okay.
[03:05:27.440 --> 03:05:28.440]  Fed: I mean,
[03:05:28.440 --> 03:05:29.440]  Fed: the Mormons
[03:05:29.440 --> 03:05:30.440]  Fed: a lot of time,
[03:05:30.440 --> 03:05:31.440]  Fed: they do missions.
[03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:32.440]  Fed: So when they go overseas,
[03:05:32.440 --> 03:05:33.440]  Fed: they learn the language,
[03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:34.440]  Fed: it's probably useful
[03:05:34.440 --> 03:05:35.440]  Fed: for like,
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:36.440]  Fed: CIA and all that kind of stuff.
[03:05:36.440 --> 03:05:37.440]  Val: Right,
[03:05:37.440 --> 03:05:38.440]  Val: good cover.
[03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:39.440]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:40.440]  Val: Yeah,
[03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:41.440]  Val: but it's so,
[03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:42.440]  Val: like,
[03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:43.440]  Val: we're so
[03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:44.440]  Val: strict with rules
[03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:45.440]  Val: and stuff.
[03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:46.440]  Val: How do you,
[03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:47.440]  Val: how do you,
[03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:48.440]  Val: justify one thing
[03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:49.440]  Val: or do something else?
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:05:50.440]  Fed: That's a good question.
[03:05:50.440 --> 03:05:51.440]  Fed: That's something
[03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:52.440]  Fed: I've,
[03:05:52.440 --> 03:05:53.440]  Fed: know nothing about.
[03:05:53.440 --> 03:05:54.440]  Val: Right.
[03:05:54.440 --> 03:05:55.440]  Fed: Well,
[03:05:55.440 --> 03:05:56.440]  Fed: being a Mormon
[03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:57.440]  Fed: won't work for the agency.
[03:05:57.440 --> 03:05:58.440]  Fed: Like,
[03:05:58.440 --> 03:05:59.440]  Fed: how do you justify,
[03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:14.440]  Val: What do you guys
[03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:15.440]  Val: do?
[03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:16.440]  Val: Jesus,
[03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:17.440]  Val: people?
[03:06:17.440 --> 03:06:18.440]  Val: Can't say that.
[03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:19.440]  Val: Okay.
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:20.440]  Val: Do it or not do it?
[03:06:20.440 --> 03:06:21.440]  Fed: No.
[03:06:21.440 --> 03:06:22.440]  Fed: I wish there was.
[03:06:28.440 --> 03:06:34.440]  Val: That's what's more impressive, what you need for me right away is the thing that you have on your plate.
[03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:40.440]  Val: What I can help you with, what you can do with the transactional for Marlowe's safety.
[03:06:40.440 --> 03:06:44.440]  Val: I would like to bro it, Steve.
[03:06:44.440 --> 03:06:46.440]  Val: Listen to me, sir.
[03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:48.440]  Thank you.
[03:06:54.440 --> 03:06:56.440]  Fed: Seriously, it caught me up.
[03:06:56.440 --> 03:06:58.440]  Val: Are you happy?
[03:06:58.440 --> 03:07:00.440]  Fed: Maybe.
[03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:02.440]  Fed: You've got to take off that pavilion.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:04.440]  Val: Thank you.
[03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:06.440]  Val: Thank you very much.
[03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:08.440]  You're welcome.
[03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:10.440]  I like the economy with our mayor.
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:12.440]  That's right.
[03:07:12.440 --> 03:07:16.440]  Val: I'm going to watch out for the Marie.
[03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:34.440]  Val: I would have to be really secretive if I now tell Marie.
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:36.440]  Val: I can't tell her everything.
[03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:40.440]  Val: What I don't tell her, she always finds out.
[03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:42.440]  Fed: What would you tell her?
[03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:48.440]  Val: I'm going to tell her, oh they offered me a job.
[03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:52.440]  Val: She'd be like, what are they paying down?
[03:07:52.440 --> 03:07:54.440]  Val: Not money.
[03:07:54.440 --> 03:07:56.440]  Val: It's a good job.
[03:07:56.440 --> 03:07:58.440]  Val: But they will have Marlowe.
[03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:00.440]  Val: They should say, trust them.
[03:08:00.440 --> 03:08:02.440]  Val: You can live with them.
[03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:04.440]  Val: See that?
[unintelligible]
03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:14.440]  She'll see you working on it.
[03:08:14.440 --> 03:08:16.440]  What are you doing?
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:18.440]  Okay, thanks.
[03:08:18.440 --> 03:08:20.440]  Val: I'll see you later.
[03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:28.440]  Val: It's fun to do an episode
[03:08:28.440 --> 03:08:32.440]  But I don't know how people will know.
[03:08:32.440 --> 03:08:34.440]  I figured it was okay to do an episode 7 today.
[03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:36.440]  Val: It was a bit rainy.
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:38.440]  But she said it was not.
[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:40.440]  It was a lot.
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:44.440]  A lot of stuff was in French.
[03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:48.440]  Which brings me to a good point.
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:50.440]  Val: So I was afraid to look at it.
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:52.440]  I don't understand what it meant.
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:54.440]  Just to take a look at it.
[03:08:54.440 --> 03:08:56.440]  I'm a hard guy, right?
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:00.440]  That's concerning.
[03:09:00.440 --> 03:09:02.440]  So that's why I just ran it over.
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:04.440]  Val: I'll forward it to you.
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:06.440]  Val: That's what I said to David.
[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:08.440]  Val: I don't know.
[03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:10.440]  Val: I would really like to use that against him somehow.
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:12.440]  I'm trying to do that.
[03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:14.440]  Val: It's legal for me to give him that.
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:16.440]  Val: But he does it with an afterward.
[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:18.440]  Val: I don't know.
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:20.440]  Fed: I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:22.440]  Fed: It's hard.
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:24.440]  Fed: It's hard to say.
[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:28.440]  Fed: But it's definitely hard to do what he did.
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:34.440]  Fed: So before the show, what's up with you?
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:36.440]  You know?
[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:38.440]  You know what's really wrong?
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:40.440]  You know?
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:42.440]  I'm just a musician.
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:44.440]  I used to play football and having...
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:46.440]  Sorry, I didn't go to it.
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:48.440]  I see.
[03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:52.440]  And there was a guy who lived about me in London.
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:54.440]  He lived in London for you.
[03:09:54.440 --> 03:09:56.440]  He was really good at acting, with the transition.
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:09:58.440]  He gave me a list of all that.
[03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:00.440]  [IP?] addresses [?]
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:02.440]  He'd be a good guy.
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:04.440]  He'd just have fun and see me.
[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.440]  You could tell that or something.
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:08.440]  And he's the one who said,
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:10.440]  I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:12.440]  And at times it's like $30.
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:14.440]  I mean, I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:18.440]  I want to spend $30 on some bullshit.
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:20.440]  I would have bought pizza.
[03:10:20.440 --> 03:10:22.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:26.440]  Well, that was about the sound of it,
[03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:28.440]  but I mean, I was really focused.
[03:10:28.440 --> 03:10:30.440]  I have 36 hours to do the single.
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:32.440]  It's been all my time.
[03:10:32.440 --> 03:10:34.440]  A lot of work.
[03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:36.440]  A lot of work.
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:38.440]  You know, I don't do that anymore.
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:40.440]  Really?
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:42.440]  Do you miss it?
[03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:44.440]  I mean, I miss lifestyle.
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:48.440]  No.
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:50.440]  I don't.
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:52.440]  I don't have music,
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:54.440]  but I think I do.
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:56.440]  I don't.
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:10:58.440]  Cross our lifestyle.
[03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:00.440]  Yeah, but you got to stop at some points.
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:02.440]  You can't be the other guy doing that.
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:04.440]  Yeah, there's a lot of things.
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:06.440]  It's not like it's still going on.
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:08.440]  Yeah, but still, it's a little creepy.
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:10.440]  We were at a party.
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:12.440]  We didn't see what's happening.
[03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:14.440]  What's the name of the meeting?
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:16.440]  I didn't talk to him.
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:18.440]  I was like, what's the change that you're doing here?
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:20.440]  You just get out of rehab.
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:22.440]  That's where he's supposed to not do it.
[03:11:22.440 --> 03:11:24.440]  He's like, let's go get a drink.
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:26.440]  And whatever.
[03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:28.440]  It's all like rehab.
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:30.440]  Things are supposed to not do it.
[03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:32.440]  So, you guys,
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:34.440]  we're having everything.
[03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:36.440]  We got the idea.
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:40.440]  There's a lot of rules.
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:42.440]  We're not supposed to be that broad.
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:44.440]  But first you're out.
[03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:46.440]  You got laid and be manipulative.
[03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:48.440]  Because we don't have your drugs here.
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:50.440]  You're trying to compensate.
[03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:52.440]  I don't know.
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:54.440]  We'll never realize that.
[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:58.440]  So you're not allowed to date at all after rehab?
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:00.440]  No.
[03:12:00.440 --> 03:12:02.440]  So, you're on a graduation?
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:04.440]  You'll get that certain tone of the dopey
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:06.440]  that you don't have for your drug.
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:08.440]  So, the relationship won't fill it up for you.
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:10.440]  But you're always going to end tragically
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:12.440]  because once you're speaking away.
[03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:14.440]  It's like what you're going to do.
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:16.440]  I'm going to act strong.
[03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:18.440]  I'm going to act strong.
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:20.440]  That's what I'm going to do.
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:22.440]  We'll just talk about that.
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:24.440]  You don't want to do it?
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:26.440]  No.
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:28.440]  It depends.
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:30.440]  You want to or you want to.
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:32.440]  If you just don't want to.
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:34.440]  If you're stuck with it.
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:36.440]  You have to.
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:38.440]  I mean, I did.
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:40.440]  Well, first of all, Muzza,
[03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:42.440]  he's called Nick.
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:44.440]  We need you to stay at this rehab
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:46.440]  but we figure out everything
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:48.440]  through your mopsie.
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:50.440]  If you don't know anything about Muzza
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:52.440]  or if you don't know anything about Muzza
[03:12:52.440 --> 03:12:54.440]  you might want to stay out here.
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:56.440]  I was banned from the UK for three years.
[03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:58.440]  I've never stayed with him.
[03:12:58.440 --> 03:13:00.440]  Nothing's relationship.
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:02.440]  So, stay the year in the California
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:04.440]  in this rehab.
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:06.440]  We'll figure out the next move.
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:08.440]  And that's when I realized
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:10.440]  that I had to learn really fast
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:12.440]  for my mother.
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:14.440]  Well, the Buddha taught me.
[03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:16.440]  She got my dad.
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:18.440]  She threw out my dad.
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:20.440]  Not the people, literally.
[03:13:20.440 --> 03:13:22.440]  But he signed it.
[03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:24.440]  But in the New York state
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:26.440]  he agreed.
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:28.440]  So, it's not up to her to throw that.
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:30.440]  So, she landed in the fall of 2004
[03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:32.440]  where she gets everything.
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:34.440]  She's very smart.
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:36.440]  And I didn't know anything about finance.
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:38.440]  But she's doing something that's happening
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:40.440]  where you can learn fast.
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:42.440]  So, that's why I learned finance.
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:46.440]  When you're desperate
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:48.440]  and you have to face off
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:50.440]  and get nothing to lose
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:52.440]  you find like you have intelligence
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:54.440]  and everything.
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:56.440]  Really, everyone has it.
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:58.440]  I think it's the current everybody.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:00.440]  If you can get rid of the emotion
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:02.440]  because emotion sort of clogs you up
[03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:04.440]  then you can get more free
[03:14:04.440 --> 03:14:06.440]  and free of focus.
[03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:08.440]  It's emotion that really blocks the emotions.
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:10.440]  And emotion is important of course
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:12.440]  but you also need the emotion to
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.440]  connect with someone to understand
[03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:16.440]  all the time.
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:18.440]  You need to control it.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:20.440]  It's the greatest freedom.
[03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:24.440]  Well, drugs.
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:26.440]  Drugs help a lot.
[03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:28.440]  When they train you, you can do it without drugs.
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:30.440]  But at first, no, you can't.
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:32.440]  But you're such an emotional mess.
[03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:34.440]  So, you take the drug
[03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:36.440]  which calms you down and makes you feel
[03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:38.440]  like it's making you focus.
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:40.440]  Like I was not crying.
[03:14:40.440 --> 03:14:42.440]  I was not keeping my father.
[03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:44.440]  And it's a reminder that
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:46.440]  that part exists.
[03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:48.440]  It's when you're pressing that existing
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:50.440]  to get it back.
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:52.440]  So, you just mind yourself that,
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:54.440]  yeah, I was free one day.
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:56.440]  So, you have it.
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:14:58.440]  So,
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:15:00.440]  you can then exchange it.
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:02.440]  And you can actually say,
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:04.440]  wait, is that
[03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:06.440]  is that my thinking?
[03:15:06.440 --> 03:15:08.440]  Is this you?
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:10.440]  Is that my question for you?
[03:15:10.440 --> 03:15:12.440]  Is this certain?
[03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:14.440]  That's the purpose of this.
[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:16.440]  Help me if you can hear me.
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:18.440]  So, if you can stop me,
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:20.440]  stop me, stop me.
[03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:22.440]  We do it with light speakers.
[03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:24.440]  We have it.
[03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:26.440]  We get it.
[03:15:26.440 --> 03:15:28.440]  It's like it becomes instinctive.
[03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:30.440]  My dad would stop me.
[03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:32.440]  He's the one.
[03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:34.440]  You guys never
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:36.440]  trust your feelings.
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:38.440]  Always trust your instincts.
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:40.440]  Your emotions.
[03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:42.440]  And there's a huge difference between
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:44.440]  your feelings and your emotions
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:46.440]  and your instincts.
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:16:00.440]  What are you talking about?
[03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:02.440]  Feelings versus questions.
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:04.440]  Your instinct, I guess.
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:06.440]  Your instinct is my emotion.
[03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:08.440]  Your instinct is my reply.
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:10.440]  It's like this danger is not in me.
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:12.440]  This is going to serve me, not serve me.
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:14.440]  I'm going to have to calculate it.
[03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:16.440]  That's the risk.
[03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:18.440]  I'm going to do the risk.
[03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:20.440]  Let's see how sad it's going to be.
[03:16:20.440 --> 03:16:22.440]  That's a year.
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:24.440]  Our brains are so fucking
[03:16:24.440 --> 03:16:26.440]  amazingly fast.
[03:16:26.440 --> 03:16:28.440]  We calculate that.
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:30.440]  And it comes out as an instinctive
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:32.440]  instinctive man.
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:34.440]  The emotion of the cloud,
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:36.440]  you can see everything through this wall
[03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:38.440]  that you're not wanted or not loved
[03:16:38.440 --> 03:16:40.440]  or you're not wanted or not loved.
[03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:42.440]  That's the way you're going to friend the world.
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:44.440]  That's the emotion you want to love.
[03:16:44.440 --> 03:16:46.440]  So focus on the world.
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:48.440]  That's all they want.
[03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:50.440]  You can do that.
[03:16:50.440 --> 03:16:52.440]  Your dad just died.
[03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:54.440]  My dad and my mother.
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:56.440]  It was terrible.
[03:16:56.440 --> 03:16:58.440]  I used to be
[03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:00.440]  like a...
[03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:02.440]  This is a country.
[03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:04.440]  I didn't do that.
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:06.440]  I didn't do shopping.
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:08.440]  People did it for me.
[03:17:08.440 --> 03:17:10.440]  All of a sudden, I'm looking at my car.
[03:17:10.440 --> 03:17:12.440]  I don't know how to do it.
[03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:14.440]  I don't know how to...
[03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:16.440]  I didn't think I had it in me.
[03:17:16.440 --> 03:17:18.440]  They did.
[03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:20.440]  I don't know. We'll see.
[03:17:20.440 --> 03:17:22.440]  We'll see.
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:24.440]  It's another thing I'm not going to go there.
[03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:28.440]  It's a party.
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:34.440]  Hello.
[03:17:34.440 --> 03:17:36.440]  How are you?
[03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:38.440]  I'm fine.
[03:17:38.440 --> 03:17:40.440]  It's been a few years.
[03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:42.440]  Did you sacrifice?
[03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:44.440]  No.
[03:17:44.440 --> 03:17:46.440]  It's been a few years.
[03:17:46.440 --> 03:17:48.440]  Not as good as this guy's.
[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:50.440]  Thanks a lot.
[03:17:50.440 --> 03:17:52.440]  What did you do for a while?
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:54.440]  For a while.
[03:17:54.440 --> 03:17:56.440]  For a while?
[03:17:56.440 --> 03:17:58.440]  Really?
[03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:00.440]  For a while.
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:02.440]  I was doing a different one.
[03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:04.440]  We'll see.
[03:18:04.440 --> 03:18:06.440]  We will do the same thing.
[03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:08.440]  We will...
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:10.440]  We'll do some research.
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:12.440]  Development drugs.
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:14.440]  Like...
[03:18:14.440 --> 03:18:16.440]  We'll see.
[03:18:16.440 --> 03:18:18.440]  Yes, yes.
[03:18:18.440 --> 03:18:20.440]  I didn't do it.
[03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:22.440]  Oh, it didn't happen.
[03:18:22.440 --> 03:18:24.440]  Yep. We didn't all...
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:26.440]  Be born in a...
[03:18:26.440 --> 03:18:28.440]  Sorry, we weren't born in a...
[03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:30.440]  We didn't all sort out...
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:32.440]  You would do a different type of drug.
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:34.440]  You would do a different type of drug.
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:36.440]  You would do a different type of drug.
[03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:38.440]  That's good.
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:40.440]  That's good.
[03:18:40.440 --> 03:18:42.440]  No, no.
[03:18:42.440 --> 03:18:44.440]  It's kind of like using drugs.
[03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:46.440]  That would be huge investments.
[03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:48.440]  They are going to offer you that.
[03:18:48.440 --> 03:18:50.440]  No, not anyone would.
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:52.440]  That's like...
[03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:54.440]  There's been a handle.
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:56.440]  There's been a handle.
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:18:58.440]  We have the FBI tries to fire
[03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:00.440]  diversely
[03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:02.440]  in terms of like backgrounds.
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:04.440]  So we don't...
[03:19:04.440 --> 03:19:06.440]  We try it.
[03:19:06.440 --> 03:19:08.440]  There's a big pool of like...
[03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:10.440]  I want to join...
[03:19:10.440 --> 03:19:12.440]  I want to join...
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:14.440]  I want to be in contact with...
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:16.440]  I want to join...
[03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:18.440]  The military.
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:20.440]  We certainly don't want to be a
[03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:22.440]  100% of that.
[03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:24.440]  We don't want to be a general...
[03:19:24.440 --> 03:19:26.440]  We don't want to be a general population.
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:28.440]  We don't want...
[03:19:28.440 --> 03:19:30.440]  We're going to get a fifth grade teacher
[03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:32.440]  when I was in high school.
[03:19:32.440 --> 03:19:34.440]  He also had a rocket scientist.
[03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:36.440]  Just a lot of people.
[03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:38.440]  I've had all over the world.
[03:19:38.440 --> 03:19:40.440]  What was a fifth grade teacher.
[03:19:40.440 --> 03:19:42.440]  They've heard of people together?
[03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:44.440]  She's actually a good...
[03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:46.440]  She's still a good agent.
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:48.440]  She must be a people person.
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:50.440]  She's very good people.
[03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:52.440]  But she's also a very good...
[03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:54.720]  and a lot of things that we had to do.
[03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:55.720]  But...
[03:19:55.720 --> 03:19:57.280]  You still have the Casanovas?
[03:19:57.280 --> 03:19:58.480]  And it still exists?
[03:19:58.480 --> 03:19:59.480]  Casanovas?
[03:19:59.480 --> 03:20:00.480]  Is it Mars?
[03:20:00.480 --> 03:20:01.480]  What's that?
[03:20:01.480 --> 03:20:02.480]  Casanovas.
[03:20:02.480 --> 03:20:03.480]  It's Mars.
[03:20:03.480 --> 03:20:06.480]  Yeah, well, we don't know a lot like that.
[03:20:06.480 --> 03:20:07.480]  It's a little thing.
[03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:09.480]  No, it's like the old 60s.
[03:20:09.480 --> 03:20:12.480]  You know, the guys who played, you get information.
[03:20:12.480 --> 03:20:13.480]  Hello.
[03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:15.480]  I don't think that's it.
[03:20:15.480 --> 03:20:16.480]  No, I don't.
[03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:18.480]  Maybe it's what's waiting for my time.
[03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:19.480]  That's the 60s.
[03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:21.480]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the...
[03:20:21.520 --> 03:20:23.520]  You know, that's the limit.
[03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:25.520]  They're working for us right now.
[03:20:25.520 --> 03:20:27.520]  You guys get fired.
[03:20:27.520 --> 03:20:29.520]  That's the same.
[03:20:29.520 --> 03:20:31.520]  Do you know how many roles we have?
[03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:34.520]  Like, half the stories of your complete bullshit.
[03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:37.520]  But, you know, it's good that there's a myth out there
[03:20:37.520 --> 03:20:40.520]  that people make you just sleep with whoever.
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:42.520]  Maybe that's...I'm sure that's what some agents said.
[03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:43.520]  It's like, no, no, no.
[03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:45.520]  I'm recruiting you for some super secret mission.
[03:20:45.520 --> 03:20:47.520]  All you gotta do is sleep with me.
[03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:48.520]  Right.
[03:20:48.560 --> 03:20:50.560]  You know, she's probably graduating.
[03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:52.560]  It's like, I'm working for the FBI.
[03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:54.560]  That's what I'm doing.
[03:20:54.560 --> 03:20:56.560]  Oh, the good question, though.
[03:20:56.560 --> 03:21:00.560]  You guys have unfettered access to, like,
[03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:05.560]  the sort of the interagency software
[03:21:05.560 --> 03:21:08.560]  where, like, if I wanted to go hack into your phone,
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:12.560]  I would do it with a new camera.
[03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:14.560]  Is there a reason why?
[03:21:14.560 --> 03:21:16.560]  Still, there's not a reason why.
[03:21:16.600 --> 03:21:19.600]  But there's a powerful cause to be able to use it.
[03:21:19.600 --> 03:21:23.600]  Like, if I wanted to hack into your phone
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:27.600]  and try your camera, would I need a passport?
[03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:28.600]  Yeah.
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:31.600]  Or is it, like, is it sure like now?
[03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:32.600]  Is it in the world?
[03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:34.600]  See, ten years ago, if you needed a passport,
[03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:35.600]  it would be very qualified to get one.
[03:21:35.600 --> 03:21:38.600]  But now it's adjacent to the point where you just ask for it.
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:39.600]  No, it's way harder.
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:40.600]  Really?
[03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:41.600]  Should that, even that?
[03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:44.600]  And just thinking theoretically is, like,
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:45.640]  even harder to do.
[03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:46.640]  Really?
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:48.640]  Yeah, to an effect.
[03:21:48.640 --> 03:21:51.640]  You're not, you're no longer searching, you're actively
[03:21:51.640 --> 03:21:53.640]  buttering or flipping.
[03:21:53.640 --> 03:21:55.640]  That's what happens.
[03:21:55.640 --> 03:21:58.640]  Yeah, then that, like, a new turn.
[03:21:58.640 --> 03:22:00.640]  Like, a turn on the camera.
[03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:02.640]  What's the difference now in a guy sitting in a car
[03:22:02.640 --> 03:22:04.640]  on top of a car?
[03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:07.640]  Look, this thing can go places for some guy in a car here.
[03:22:07.640 --> 03:22:08.640]  Which is...
[03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:09.640]  In a car?
[03:22:09.640 --> 03:22:10.640]  In a car.
[03:22:10.640 --> 03:22:11.640]  In a car in your house.
[03:22:11.640 --> 03:22:13.640]  Who's a guy in a car?
[03:22:13.680 --> 03:22:15.680]  Yeah, I thought it was you guys.
[03:22:15.680 --> 03:22:16.680]  See you guys?
[03:22:16.680 --> 03:22:18.680]  We're in the triangle.
[03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:20.680]  I don't think so.
[03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:22.680]  There's some other interesting things to see.
[03:22:22.680 --> 03:22:25.680]  You got a guy outside of the brewery.
[03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:28.680]  So he's in the same place with the triangle.
[03:22:28.680 --> 03:22:31.680]  And then every time he spots, I mean, it's a wave.
[03:22:31.680 --> 03:22:33.680]  I thought it was you.
[03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:35.680]  Might be, like, see a higher-department investigator
[03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:37.680]  for all I know.
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:38.680]  Maybe that, too.
[03:22:38.680 --> 03:22:40.680]  Let's take a picture of the place.
[03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:42.680]  Can I just run it here?
[03:22:42.720 --> 03:22:43.720]  How would you run it?
[03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:45.720]  Oh, I got some.
[03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:47.720]  You got a guy.
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:49.720]  That's the thing.
[03:22:49.720 --> 03:22:51.720]  I got a guy.
[03:22:51.720 --> 03:22:53.720]  You used to be seen in the improviser
[03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:55.720]  and you guys know how to do it.
[03:22:55.720 --> 03:22:57.720]  Oh, I know.
[03:22:57.720 --> 03:22:59.720]  That is...
[03:22:59.720 --> 03:23:01.720]  How do you put that?
[03:23:01.720 --> 03:23:02.720]  Stuff.
[03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:04.720]  I mean, you can't do it by yourself.
[03:23:04.720 --> 03:23:06.720]  The level of this is not as much as it needs to be
[03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:09.720]  to roll with the times and adapt.
[03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:11.760]  Like, for example,
[03:23:11.760 --> 03:23:14.760]  this whole encryption key battle,
[03:23:14.760 --> 03:23:18.760]  like, you know, we've had previous leaders talk about,
[03:23:18.760 --> 03:23:21.760]  like, what do you need to give up the encryption key?
[03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:23.760]  But we all kind of know, like,
[03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:25.760]  philosophically, that'll never,
[03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:27.760]  and that shouldn't happen if it doesn't matter.
[03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:29.760]  It's, like, a losing battle.
[03:23:29.760 --> 03:23:31.760]  We're just going to, unfortunately, have to adapt.
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:34.760]  If you just build a job, it's just going to be harder.
[03:23:34.760 --> 03:23:37.760]  And then many, you know, like,
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:41.800]  these old-school techniques
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:43.800]  that, like, talking to people, like,
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:45.800]  we're talking right now are talking to people
[03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:47.800]  that are now way more, you know,
[03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:49.800]  just sitting at your desk
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:51.800]  and looking at, like, a pipeline.
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:54.800]  So it becomes, there's a question figure
[03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:56.800]  at work sometimes.
[03:23:56.800 --> 03:23:58.800]  And, like, swaying back tomorrow.
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:01.800]  And this is just me, but it should be hard.
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:03.800]  It should be hard?
[03:24:03.800 --> 03:24:05.800]  It should be hard.
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:07.840]  It should be hard.
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:09.840]  I agree a lot.
[03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:11.840]  It should be better.
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:13.840]  It's not the way it works.
[03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:15.840]  It's the way it works.
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:17.840]  There's nothing, there's no secret to it.
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:19.840]  It's just that, you know,
[03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:21.840]  I can find it when I want it,
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:23.840]  but I don't really want it yet.
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:25.840]  There's nothing I can do.
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:27.840]  You can do that.
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:29.840]  You know, I mean, I can do it.
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:31.840]  I can do it anywhere in the world.
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:33.840]  You know, once you get there,
[03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:35.880]  you have to actually keep a secret from all of them.
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:37.880]  That's a weird quote.
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:39.880]  I don't know what to make of it.
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:41.880]  You just have to adapt to it and accept it, I guess.
[03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:43.880]  It's true.
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:45.880]  It's just, like, you know,
[03:24:45.880 --> 03:24:47.880]  good pre-LLCs instead of work.
[03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:51.880]  You don't have your name on it.
[03:24:51.880 --> 03:24:53.880]  That's beautiful things.
[03:24:53.880 --> 03:24:55.880]  That's why it's a living dog.
[03:24:55.880 --> 03:24:57.880]  You can have a fake name.
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:24:59.880]  You can have a name.
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:01.880]  Perfectly legal.
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:03.920]  It's a good thing to do.
[03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:05.920]  Jersey and all of Iowa.
[03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:07.920]  Yeah, it's just like a state.
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:09.920]  It's a state.
[03:25:09.920 --> 03:25:11.920]  You know what?
[03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:13.920]  It's very deep, very Jersey.
[03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:15.920]  I think that's pretty sure.
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:17.920]  Probably.
[03:25:17.920 --> 03:25:19.920]  It's a good spot.
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:25.920]  Thank you.
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:27.920]  You want to go?
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:29.920]  I'll go.
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:31.960]  I'm trying to be right there.
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:33.960]  Yeah.
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:37.960]  Actually, I think if you prefer
[03:25:37.960 --> 03:25:39.960]  an opera or a movie,
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:41.960]  I think you can take it.
[03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:43.960]  I think you can take it.
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:45.960]  I really do.
[03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:47.960]  No, I don't.
[03:25:47.960 --> 03:25:49.960]  I think you can take it.
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:51.960]  You can go to a opera or a movie.
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:53.960]  You can go to a opera or a movie.
[03:25:53.960 --> 03:25:55.960]  You can go to a opera or a movie.
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:57.960]  You can go to a movie.
[03:25:57.960 --> 03:25:59.960]  You know what?
[03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:01.960]  You have to do it.
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:03.960]  You have to do it right.
[03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:05.960]  You can go to a opera or a movie.
[03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:07.960]  You can do it right.
[03:26:07.960 --> 03:26:09.960]  You can go to a opera or a movie.
[03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:11.960]  You can do it.
[03:26:11.960 --> 03:26:13.960]  You can do it.
[03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:16.960]  You know what?
[03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:18.960]  You can do it.
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:20.960]  Okay.
[03:26:20.960 --> 03:26:22.960]  I'm not sure.
[03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:24.960]  I mean, I can't worry.
[03:26:24.960 --> 03:26:26.960]  You can do it.
[03:26:26.960 --> 03:26:28.960]  That's the thing I learned.
[03:26:28.960 --> 03:26:33.960]  It's not, I can't, it's, it's all I'm learning.
[03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:35.960]  It's not only me.
[03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:37.960]  It's only freedom, too.
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:39.960]  It's a freedom, you know what I'm saying?
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:42.960]  It's worrying about a kid, and then everything is justified.
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:45.960]  Everything is justified if it's for his safety.
[03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:47.960]  You know?
[03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:50.960]  That's the interesting part of it.
[03:26:50.960 --> 03:26:53.960]  Where are you thinking about yourself all the time?
[03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:55.960]  I don't know.
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:26:58.960]  I think it's more because of the protector.
[03:26:58.960 --> 03:27:02.960]  Yeah, or, uh, or...
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:04.960]  I don't know.
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:06.960]  There's a word for it.
[03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:08.960]  You're a protector of someone.
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:10.960]  Someone else's life is now.
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:12.960]  Yeah.
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:14.960]  Well, it's also pretty scary as shit.
[03:27:14.960 --> 03:27:17.960]  You know, you're accountable for everything.
[03:27:18.960 --> 03:27:21.960]  What if it turns out to be an accident?
[03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:23.960]  Shit.
[03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:25.960]  That's when you were like, that was the other person.
[03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:27.960]  Shit.
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:31.960]  Yeah, you're gonna have faith, though.
[03:27:31.960 --> 03:27:33.960]  That's all for me.
[03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:35.960]  Here you go.
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:42.960]  Are you serious?
[03:27:42.960 --> 03:27:44.960]  He's just searing in the sun.
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:46.960]  Well, he's in his heart, right?
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:48.960]  Yeah.
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:55.960]  There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
[03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:57.960]  What's that?
[03:27:57.960 --> 03:27:59.960]  There's a lot of stuff going on with oil contracts down there.
[03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:01.960]  And a trade-off and a trade-off.
[03:28:01.960 --> 03:28:03.960]  It's really big.
[03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:05.960]  The whole concept of oil contracts is really big.
[03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:07.960]  Yeah.
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:09.960]  The oil companies are very political.
[03:28:09.960 --> 03:28:12.960]  There's a lot of other factors that you can think of.
[03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:14.960]  Yeah?
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:16.960]  Just political factors?
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:18.960]  People that are just fucking...
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:20.960]  I think everyone else is off.
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:22.960]  Well, I think there's a lot of other things.
[03:28:22.960 --> 03:28:24.960]  Peaks down around the whole...
[03:28:24.960 --> 03:28:26.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:28.960]  I don't know.
[03:28:28.960 --> 03:28:30.960]  People have issues with oil contracts.
[03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:32.960]  How do you think it's going to work?
[03:28:40.960 --> 03:28:42.960]  How do you think it's gonna work?
[03:29:42.960 --> 03:29:44.960]  How to get it to work?
[03:29:44.960 --> 03:29:46.960]  How do you think it's gonna work?
[03:29:58.960 --> 03:30:00.960]  Where positive positive 230 are set
[03:30:00.960 --> 03:30:02.960]  where positive and positive C.
[03:30:02.960 --> 03:30:04.960]  What are the odds,
[03:30:04.960 --> 03:30:06.960]  What is theculрей to choose
[03:30:36.960 --> 03:30:38.960]  Why do we need to do that?
[03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:41.960]  Because we don't need to pay the money out.
[03:30:41.960 --> 03:30:43.960]  It's different.
[03:31:12.960 --> 03:31:13.960]  You have to carry it on your knee alone.
[03:31:13.960 --> 03:31:14.960]  It's different.
[03:31:14.960 --> 03:31:15.960]  It doesn't.
[03:31:15.960 --> 03:31:16.960]  Yes.
[03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:27.460]  It won't
[03:31:27.460 --> 03:31:28.460]  It won't be big.
[03:31:28.460 --> 03:31:33.460]  It can stand too low.
[03:31:33.460 --> 03:31:38.460]  But it didn't end, obviously, I mean, it still worked.
[03:31:38.460 --> 03:31:41.460]  Yeah, that's right, right now, but like, in a, oh.
[03:31:41.460 --> 03:31:42.460]  Now it's 11.5.
[03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:43.460]  11.5?
[03:31:43.460 --> 03:31:44.460]  Yeah.
[03:31:44.460 --> 03:31:45.460]  Okay.
[03:31:45.460 --> 03:31:46.460]  I'm sorry.
[03:31:46.460 --> 03:31:47.460]  I'm sorry.
[03:31:47.460 --> 03:31:48.460]  It dropped to...
[03:31:48.460 --> 03:31:49.460]  It went up to 12,000.
[03:31:49.460 --> 03:31:50.460]  It dropped to...
[03:31:50.460 --> 03:31:51.460]  Yeah.
[03:31:51.460 --> 03:31:52.460]  4,000.
[03:31:52.460 --> 03:31:55.460]  At least then I could regulate it.
[03:31:55.460 --> 03:31:56.460]  Do you like it?
[03:31:56.460 --> 03:31:57.460]  At least a lot?
[03:31:57.460 --> 03:31:59.460]  Well, yeah, I don't like it.
[03:31:59.460 --> 03:32:02.460]  I just like to talk to you regularly.
[03:32:02.460 --> 03:32:07.460]  Yeah, I still haven't tried it, you know.
[03:32:07.460 --> 03:32:11.460]  I didn't expect you to do this, but you did.
[03:32:11.460 --> 03:32:16.460]  You didn't have to decide what you wanted to try.
[03:32:16.460 --> 03:32:17.460]  You just didn't know.
[03:32:17.460 --> 03:32:24.460]  You didn't even know how to do it.
[03:32:24.460 --> 03:32:25.460]  You just flashed in there.
[03:32:25.460 --> 03:32:27.460]  You could be just pumping down.
[03:32:27.460 --> 03:32:28.460]  Yeah.
[03:32:28.460 --> 03:32:33.460]  I didn't want to say too much.
[03:32:33.460 --> 03:32:37.460]  The whole Brickel-Prinsky arena.
[03:32:37.460 --> 03:32:38.460]  I don't know.
[03:32:38.460 --> 03:32:45.460]  I don't think you should say too much.
[03:32:45.460 --> 03:32:46.460]  You're the last one.
[03:32:46.460 --> 03:32:48.460]  You're the last one.
[03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:49.460]  No, I'm the last one.
[03:32:49.460 --> 03:32:50.460]  I'm the last one.
[03:32:50.460 --> 03:32:51.460]  I'm the last one.
[03:32:51.460 --> 03:32:52.460]  I'm the last one.
[03:32:52.460 --> 03:32:53.460]  No, I'm the last one.
[03:33:25.460 --> 03:33:28.460]  I'm the most iconic person in the room.
[03:33:28.460 --> 03:33:30.460]  I'm the last one.
[03:33:43.460 --> 03:33:45.460]  I was the last one.
[03:33:45.460 --> 03:33:46.460]  I'm the last one on my list.
[03:33:46.460 --> 03:33:47.460]  I got the person.
[03:33:47.460 --> 03:33:50.460]  So it's just been decided that there's noney for now.
[03:33:50.460 --> 03:33:52.460]  How did you figure that out?
[03:33:52.460 --> 03:33:56.460]  I just put the time last time I logged in.
[03:33:56.460 --> 03:33:58.460]  I didn't log in. I wasn't going to log in.
[03:33:58.460 --> 03:34:00.460]  What the fuck? I didn't log in the moment.
[03:34:00.460 --> 03:34:02.460]  And what would they go for?
[03:34:02.460 --> 03:34:04.460]  And then I took the last window.
[03:34:04.460 --> 03:34:06.460]  They didn't even open.
[03:34:06.460 --> 03:34:08.460]  I think I just sort of assumed it was a log file
[03:34:08.460 --> 03:34:10.460]  because the windows were open.
[03:34:10.460 --> 03:34:12.460]  But I actually don't really know what they thought.
[03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:14.460]  I still think it could be gone.
[03:34:14.460 --> 03:34:16.460]  When the gun thought I was by.
[03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:22.460]  Glenn was a funny story.
[03:34:22.460 --> 03:34:24.460]  So after the Bahamas,
[03:34:24.460 --> 03:34:26.460]  he slides me back to his house.
[03:34:26.460 --> 03:34:28.460]  At first I thought I was staying at a hotel.
[03:34:28.460 --> 03:34:30.460]  He said, go to his house.
[03:34:30.460 --> 03:34:32.460]  And it turns out I was at his house.
[03:34:32.460 --> 03:34:34.460]  Why am I staying here?
[03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:36.460]  It's too hot right now in Florida.
[03:34:36.460 --> 03:34:38.460]  And it's too hot in DC.
[03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:40.460]  You can't put your hotel in.
[03:34:40.460 --> 03:34:42.460]  You've got to stay here.
[03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:44.460]  Fortunately, my wife is gone on a vacation.
[03:34:44.460 --> 03:34:46.460]  But you can stay in her room.
[03:34:46.460 --> 03:34:48.460]  Her room.
[03:34:48.460 --> 03:34:50.460]  They haven't slept in the same rooms
[03:34:50.460 --> 03:34:52.460]  for like ten years.
[03:34:52.460 --> 03:34:54.460]  So they're separated by the same house.
[03:34:54.460 --> 03:34:56.460]  Okay, so I stayed in his room.
[03:34:56.460 --> 03:34:58.460]  I was asleep.
[03:34:58.460 --> 03:35:00.460]  I was so tired and I had some long flight.
[03:35:00.460 --> 03:35:02.460]  And then I wake up.
[03:35:02.460 --> 03:35:04.460]  And you know,
[03:35:04.460 --> 03:35:06.460]  God save your cigarette.
[03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:08.460]  He has this colonial house with this kitchen porch.
[03:35:08.460 --> 03:35:10.460]  And I notice there's like a brick
[03:35:10.460 --> 03:35:12.460]  in the screen window.
[03:35:12.460 --> 03:35:14.460]  Yeah.
[03:35:14.460 --> 03:35:16.460]  I sat there the last night.
[03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:18.460]  I didn't call it a good story.
[03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:20.460]  What were you doing at 2am last night?
[03:35:20.460 --> 03:35:22.460]  I was asleep.
[03:35:22.460 --> 03:35:24.460]  In bed.
[03:35:24.460 --> 03:35:26.460]  No, you weren't.
[03:35:26.460 --> 03:35:28.460]  I heard a car.
[03:35:28.460 --> 03:35:30.460]  I saw you run to the car.
[03:35:30.460 --> 03:35:32.460]  They gave him something.
[03:35:32.460 --> 03:35:34.460]  What did you give him?
[03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:36.460]  I didn't give him anything.
[03:35:36.460 --> 03:35:38.460]  I have it all in video.
[03:35:38.460 --> 03:35:40.460]  And it is this huge 1997 camera
[03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:42.460]  that you know,
[03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:44.460]  he has not updated its RAM systems.
[03:35:44.460 --> 03:35:46.460]  Made by Nintendo.
[03:35:46.460 --> 03:35:48.460]  Nintendo, yeah.
[03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:50.460]  And so he starts going through his,
[03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:52.460]  you know, his fast-forward
[03:35:52.460 --> 03:35:54.460]  thing in his office.
[03:35:54.460 --> 03:35:56.460]  He takes me to the office.
[03:35:56.460 --> 03:35:58.460]  He's like, he's so
[03:35:58.460 --> 03:36:00.460]  convinced that he's caught a Russian spy
[03:36:00.460 --> 03:36:02.460]  in his house trying to get out of there.
[03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:04.460]  Dossier just was published.
[03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:06.460]  He's like,
[03:36:06.460 --> 03:36:08.460]  he's out.
[03:36:08.460 --> 03:36:10.460]  And then,
[03:36:10.460 --> 03:36:12.460]  around 2am,
[03:36:12.460 --> 03:36:14.460]  we see a hundred shadowy figure
[03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:16.460]  approach.
[03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:18.460]  Wow.
[03:36:18.460 --> 03:36:20.460]  And I see it.
[03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:22.460]  And I see the figures sort of stumble and fall.
[03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:24.460]  And they stand up really quick.
[03:36:24.460 --> 03:36:26.460]  And I look around and see the camera.
[03:36:26.460 --> 03:36:28.460]  Glad he's a nice little kid.
[03:36:28.460 --> 03:36:30.460]  He's strong, he's strong.
[03:36:30.460 --> 03:36:32.460]  And you can't get into.
[03:36:32.460 --> 03:36:34.460]  He's trying to slice the window screen.
[03:36:34.460 --> 03:36:36.460]  The only window that doesn't have an alarm
[03:36:36.460 --> 03:36:38.460]  is the camera.
[03:36:38.460 --> 03:36:40.460]  No, no, Glenn Simpson.
[03:36:40.460 --> 03:36:42.460]  He's going to be a Russian spy
[03:36:42.460 --> 03:36:44.460]  when his son tries to sneak back in
[03:36:44.460 --> 03:36:46.460]  for a party.
[03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.460]  Still no apology.
[03:36:48.460 --> 03:36:50.460]  You guys.
[03:36:52.460 --> 03:36:54.460]  I appreciate that.
