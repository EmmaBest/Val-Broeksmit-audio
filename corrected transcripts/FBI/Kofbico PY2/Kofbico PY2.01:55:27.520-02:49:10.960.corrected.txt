[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.000]  Val: Do you like political shit?
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.280]  Val: Or do you like give me a genre?
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.200]  Fed: I work in cyber crime.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.040]  Val: Oh, you do?
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.840]  Val: OK, that's what I thought.
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.600]  Fed: You read it on that article, I know.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.080]  Fed: So you're going to do that part, right?
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.520]  Fed: So I work in cyber crime.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.800]  Fed: So we look for hackers.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.360]  Fed: We do ransomware, or BTC, and [unintelligible]jacking.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.360]  Val: Oh, you do?
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.360]  Val: Really?
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.160]  Fed: Yeah, we do a bunch of other stuff, like computer issues in general.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:55.640]  Fed: I do some stalking pieces.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.120]  Val: Do you have all the toys and tech shit, too?
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.440]  Fed: I've got a lot of toys.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.200]  Val: Oh, really?
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.000]  Val: OK.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:01.520]  Fed: But yeah.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.800]  Val: Dude, OK.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.720]  Val: Do you need like an apprentice?
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:06.720]  Fed: All right.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.320]  Fed: Do you want to come out to QC and see all the toys we have?
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:13.640]  Fed: In our hand presses, and then you ask the whole band to give them out.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.040]  Val: Well, yeah, OK.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.600]  Val: OK, yeah, well, I can help you.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:18.880]  Val: I'm a self-taught hacker.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:19.840]  Val: I'm not very good.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.480]  Val: I did not hack Sony, OK?
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.640]  Val: I did not do that.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.240]  Val: They was accused of that, [sic] but I did not do that.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.080]  Val: The stuff on DDoS Secrets, I was stupid enough to say,
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:33.280]  Val: Emma, can you actually give me credit for my stuff?
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.400]  Val: Can you put my name?
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.880]  Val: I'm the only idiot that said, here, put my name on it.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.800]  Val: But MPS, Monty Duposky, that was not a hack of the documents
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.000]  Val: were given to me by the Anatella Rossi.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.320]  Val: So it was not a hack.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:50.840]  Val: And she said, I want you to make this public as possible,
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.320]  Val: because we need David Rossi's story out there.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.480]  Val: So I said, of course.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.960]  Val: And she knew I had connections with New York Times,
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.760]  Val: and most journals, and that's what she wanted.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.680]  Val: So I helped her, and Luca was her lawyer.
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.560]  Val: It seems like a very, like you walk in one light bulb
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:10.600]  Val: on this old ancient desk, smoking a cigarette,
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:15.720]  Val: speaking Italian, perfect cliche of a lawyer.
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.760]  Val: He also wanted all this everywhere.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.280]  Val: He wanted me to disseminate as much as I could.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:22.600]  Val: We had a deal.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.960]  Val: I said, if you can give me anything on McKaylee Faisola,
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:27.560]  Val: anything on my father, anything you got,
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.120]  Val: I'll give you whatever I have.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.200]  Val: And I don't really, let's look for David Rossi.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.200]  Val: I don't have much in here.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.320]  Val: If you want to do it, you can do it right now.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.520]  Val: So that was our trade.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:39.400]  Val: And man, I told you in town, but he told me
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:42.040]  Val: the craziest fucking story.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:44.680]  Val: It'll take a long time to tell you the story.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.040]  Val: The short version is that Monty Duposky, the Calabria mafia,
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:54.560]  Val: is using MPS to launder their money.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.120]  Val: And they're using it in very interesting and creative ways,
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.520]  Val: like putting cash in basketballs for the Italian basketball
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.080]  Val: team.
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.400]  Val: Literally, they'll have basketballs filled with cash.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:09.600]  Val: And then they give the basketballs to some other team.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.520]  Val: They trade them with other basketballs.
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.280]  Val: And that's how they do the cash exchange.
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.440]  Val: Fucking weird.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.920]  Val: I swear to God.
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.440]  Val: And we've got David Rossi.
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:19.800]  Val: And Anatella says this happened.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.120]  Val: And Luca says this is what happened.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.760]  Val: David Rossi would pick up just a briefcase full of cash.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:26.440]  Val: He'd rent a car.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.640]  Val: He would drive from Siena to Lugano.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.600]  Val: And he would just start dumping cash into different accounts.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.640]  Val: And then one guy that picked up the cash count
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:42.840]  Val: is Cardinal Scorano from the Vatican, caught on CCTV.
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:43.800]  Val: And he's laundering money.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:46.960]  Val: He's got a history of being a dirty banker as well.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.040]  Val: So this is very interesting.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.480]  Val: But no one's gone after him the second time.
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:51.920]  Fed: He's got to go.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.960]  Fed: Or has to mention that he doesn't go.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.240]  Fed: Both of them.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.600]  Fed: And how do you know what to tell him?
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.640]  Val: I went over and then visited her.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.320]  Val: When I was a, it's a really, it's another story
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:06.040]  Val: if you want to have a story time.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:09.680]  Val: But I was trapped in Amsterdam.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.760]  Val: Like literally trapped in a fucking campsite.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.240]  Val: Someone broke into my rental car and stole,
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:19.120]  Val: like I had this computer in black case, Macbook,
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.840]  Val: and it was underneath the passenger seat.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.600]  Val: And it's the dead of night in Amsterdam.
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:27.000]  Val: Like 3 AM, I'm going into town and I buy some cigarettes.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.080]  Val: So I leave the car for a little, maybe 10 minutes.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.240]  Val: And I walk back and cobblestone streets and I see glass.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.840]  Val: I say, oh, poor fucker, guys, car broke in.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:36.880]  Val: It's mine.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.800]  Val: No, they did not take my passport.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:42.560]  Val: They did not take my 30 or 40 euros.
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.040]  Val: You know, sitting in that little tray between the passenger
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.120]  Val: and the driver's side.
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.200]  Val: They didn't take my fender strad in the back seat
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.400]  Val: or anything else.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.480]  Val: They only took that computer, which I have a dutch bank
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:55.840]  Val: stuff that I had just bought in New York City
[01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:57.400]  Val: a month and a half prior.
[01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:00.680]  Val: And I just organized all my dutch bank shit,
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.240]  Val: all the files on that computer.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.080]  Val: It was encrypted.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.720]  Val: There's no way anyone can get to it.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.520]  Val: And anyone that would pull off something like that,
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.360]  Val: it's got to be a shitty private investigator.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.760]  Val: There's no, anyone that's sophisticated
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:12.800]  Val: would have just fucking hacked it, you know,
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.600]  Val: or given up on anyone saying it was encrypted.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.440]  Val: There's no way in.
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.640]  Val: It was air gap, I forgot to say.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:17.480]  Val: There's no way.
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:20.080]  Val: But that's the only thing that was taken.
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:23.240]  Val: And I suspect Deutsche Bank hired a private investigator.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:24.640]  Val: That's what I think.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.000]  Val: In Prague, I thought I was gonna die
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.560]  Val: when this guy, Italian thug, pulls me out of the car
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.000]  Val: and starts beating on me.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:38.040]  Val: And he doesn't speak a word of English.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.440]  Val: I just came to buy some car to the mall in Czechoslovakia.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.920]  Val: Have you ever been to a mall in Prague?
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.400]  Val: It's fucking weird.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.480]  Val: It's a weird place.
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:47.720]  Fed: I once rode on a train.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.880]  Val: Oh, in Prague?
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.200]  Val: What happened?
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.040]  Fed: I got to get off.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:51.880]  Val: No, no.
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.440]  Fed: I ended up in a train.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.280]  Val: That's not good.
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.600]  Fed: It was not good.
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.880]  Fed: No, it was like, it was bad.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.120]  Val: Yeah, I hit the SOS button in the car, like,
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.520]  Val: help, I'm being murdered.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.800]  Val: This guy's gonna murder me.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.320]  Val: And I forgot, I had bought a fake gun,
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.880]  Val: like a BB gun in Germany.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.840]  Val: And I never, I don't know anything about guns,
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.560]  Val: but I should have used it.
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.800]  Val: Maybe he would have run away,
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.080]  Val: but I forgot it was in the fucking apartment.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.320]  Val: So instead I'm just like, I use my phone.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.320]  Val: Look, you're on camera.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.600]  Val: Stop kicking me, stop this.
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:20.160]  Val: You're being on camera.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.720]  Val: And the SOS, hears it all.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.040]  Val: And next thing I know, the fucking SWAT teams.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.120]  Val: They got machine guns, there's six of them.
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.160]  Val: And they surround us, and they tell the guy,
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.800]  Val: he has fucking hands up, and I'm like,
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:34.400]  Val: that's the guy, we know that's the guy.
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:35.520]  Val: They're speaking English.
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:39.160]  Val: And then the dude does the strangest thing.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:42.720]  Val: He's surrounded by the SWAT team, with M16s,
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:44.400]  Val: wherever those big guns are.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:48.680]  Val: He takes off his shirt, so you can see he's topless, right?
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.920]  Val: Why does he take off his shirt?
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.160]  Val: Cause he's got military tattoos.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.240]  Val: This is how he's going to communicate to the Czech police
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:55.640]  Val: that I'm one of you.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.920]  Val: That's what he did [unintelligible]
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.680]  Val: at the EU military, some sort of service.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.240]  Val: And they put down the gun, it works.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:04.320]  Val: They're like, what is going on here?
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.120]  Val: Turns out, we take over the police station,
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:11.800]  Val: and like a fucking lady from a central casting,
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.680]  Val: Interpol, shows up, you know?
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:16.640]  Val: He's like, I don't want to be here in a sunday or anything.
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:19.920]  Val: Get me, who's this stupid American, you know, sorry.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:21.440]  Val: Turns out he's from Avis rental car,
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.720]  Val: and he just came to repo the car.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.960]  Val: That's the fucking crazy shit that it was, man.
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.840]  Val: It was a weird time, you know?
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.960]  Val: I don't know why I told you that story, but it's fine.
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.480]  Val: What was the question?
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.320]  Val: Sorry.
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.160]  Fed: Let's go back to your hacking system.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:35.000]  Val: Oh, hacking?
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:35.840]  Val: Yes.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.720]  Fed: What kind of skills do you know,
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:38.920]  Fed: what kind of techniques do you know?
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.160]  Val: Well, I guess my, the only one I pulled off,
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:44.960]  Val: like really successfully was my mother.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:48.160]  Val: But we had a lot of time in planning, though.
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.320]  Val: It was just a man in the middle of watching my hack.
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:51.200]  Val: It was really easy.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.480]  Fed: Was it a Wi-Fi fan app or something?
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.920]  Val: I have a pineapple, but I did not use a pineapple.
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:57.800]  Val: I could not, I was like, I had no money, I had nothing.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.760]  Val: I had to learn how to increase the output of my battery
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.920]  Val: power on the MacBook to handle all the fucking thoroughfare
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.720]  Val: that was coming in through the,
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.640]  Val: well, I had practiced at this hotel down there.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:12.720]  Val: They called the, in Venice Beach,
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.960]  Val: but it was a, I spoofed their,
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:22.560]  Val: it's in Manhattan Beach,
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.240]  Val: and it was where I learned everything for two weeks.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.720]  Val: Anyway, I spoofed the router,
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.800]  Val: and I learned Wireshark at that time,
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.400]  Val: which was like driving me crazy
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.920]  Val: because all I got were the packets,
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.280]  Val: but I could not figure out how to put the packets together
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:38.360]  Val: and took me, like, maybe I'm slow, I don't know,
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:39.560]  Val: but it took me a while to figure out
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.040]  Val: how to put the fucking packets together.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.440]  Val: And once I did, I was like, shit, I have passwords now.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.160]  Val: I have some, well, not full passwords,
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.440]  Val: they're still broken up,
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:51.920]  Val: but you can just put them into a algorithm that will,
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:56.240]  Val: yeah, John the Ripper or something,
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.600]  Val: anything that's, actually, John the Ripper won't work,
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.200]  Val: it's more like a, I don't know, it's,
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.640]  Val: Sorry?
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.800]  Fed: Rainbow table?
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.520]  Val: No, the table one, that's not very easy one,
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:11.440]  Val: the table hack, that's the injection one,
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.080]  Val: were you in KaliLinux, you're talking about?
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.320]  Fed: Yeah, it's been a long time since I took that class,
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.520]  Fed: but I thought you're just running it
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.040]  Fed: against a dictionary or something?
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.600]  Val: Yeah, well, you are, but you also had an algorithm
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.200]  Val: that's specific to what you're looking for.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:26.360]  Val: Like, I knew my mom's,
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:29.120]  Val: my mom would have a very specific list
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.400]  Val: of names she would use, right?
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.440]  Val: So I had to plug in just those,
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.400]  Val: and I had to have the, you know,
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.320]  Val: anything over eight fucking,
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:39.360]  Val: it's good we can talk a little bit, this is fun,
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.000]  Val: anything over eight letters is gonna take over
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.760]  Val: a day and a half, unless you have a 20 gig GEX,
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.680]  Val: whatever, NVIDIA card, you know,
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.240]  Val: that's with Elcomsoft, which is the fastest
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.160]  Val: password cracker I've seen so far right now,
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:54.320]  Val: on the market, I'm sure you guys
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.960]  Val: probably have access to something cooler than that,
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.400]  Val: but it takes a long time.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.400]  Val: But it's a lot of it, you just have to use your intuition
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:03.480]  Val: or make a phone call, you know, I didn't say you,
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:06.800]  Val: you know, that's the best way to do it is this,
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:09.960]  Val: they call it social engineering,
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:13.360]  Val: so that's the most fun way to do it.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.680]  Fed: How do you learn, like, do you take classes?
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:17.880]  Fed: You too, we don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:22.120]  Val: I was, you don't understand, my dad just killed himself,
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.200]  Val: my mom cut me out of the family,
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:28.920]  Val: I was sequestered to rehab, it was a very nice rehab,
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:32.040]  Val: but I was not free, I was like, for four months,
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.520]  Val: I'd say that.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.640]  Fed: You're a whole lot more than me,
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.920]  Fed: I've taken the classes that you and I,
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:38.680]  Fed: I don't understand everything.
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:42.280]  Val: But I had to, it was like, if you have no money
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:43.480]  Val: and you have to feed yourself
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.960]  Val: and someone throws you in a foreign country,
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.360]  Val: you're gonna learn, you know, that's what it was for me,
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.240]  Val: it was like, I had to know why my dad killed himself,
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:51.760]  Val: I had to figure it out, I had to get into his email,
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.720]  Val: so I just sat down and fucking focused.
[02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.600]  Val: I was impressed, I was like,
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:57.760]  Val: I was planning on killing myself,
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:00.120]  Val: you know what, maybe my mom will learn something
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:01.600]  Val: if I die the same year, you know,
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:03.160]  Val: maybe my sister will never have the stuff,
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:04.800]  Val: I was being a martyr, you know,
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.440]  Val: I was being a little shit too, being an asshole.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.480]  Val: And the doctor said, you know what Val,
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.920]  Val: we're gonna try and give you adderall,
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:15.080]  Val: let's see what this does, what the fuck that was like.
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:17.440]  Val: You know, and then I take it, I'm playing,
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.000]  Val: three hours like that.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.200]  Val: All right, let's learn hacking, you know,
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.320]  Val: finance is next.
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:24.880]  Val: And you know what, it fucking saved my life that thing,
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:26.400]  Val: it really did, I drugged,
[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:27.560]  Val: and people say don't do drugs,
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.960]  Val: but sometimes drugs really work, it shows you.
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.840]  Val: Yeah, if you're depressed, you don't see any hope,
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.720]  Val: sometimes the drug will just give you a glimpse
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.800]  Val: and remind you that there is another way
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:42.240]  Val: of viewing the world, you know, that's it.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:44.280]  Val: But anyway, yeah, I was fueled with adderall,
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.320]  Val: it was very helpful.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:50.040]  Val: Yeah, I found focus, I never, like I was a dumb musician,
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.400]  Val: I thought I had, there's no way I was gonna learn
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.440]  Val: how a derivative work, right?
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:57.040]  Val: I had no fucking, I was very proud of myself,
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.600]  Val: and I thought my father was very proud too,
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:01.320]  Val: and that's kind of another thing, kind of,
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.960]  Val: you know, a little fuel, a fuel to the fire.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:08.000]  Fed: So what other things really need to happen?
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.960]  Fed: Like, do you know anything about ransomware?
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:14.480]  Val: I do, yeah, I stay away from it, it sounds,
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:16.160]  Val: I mean, it sounds like it's really,
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.960]  Val: it's not, I mean, I've never had anything around somewhere,
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:22.160]  Val: but it doesn't seem like a difficult thing to break,
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:24.200]  Val: I mean, it's gotta be localized on the computer
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:26.480]  Val: and you can isolate it, it's not,
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.080]  Val: if you take the computer offline,
[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:30.720]  Val: it's not like a self-destruct button
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:34.800]  Val: that where all of a sudden your computer's gone dead,
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.120]  Val: you can isolate the fucking hack.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.360]  Val: It's just like anything, you know, any virus.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.640]  Val: Well, not like any virus, I don't know much about it,
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.560]  Val: but if someone's putting a foreign code
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.440]  Val: onto your computer, it's depending where it is,
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:48.200]  Val: and again, remember, there's different types,
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.640]  Val: and with Intel, the new shit we learned about Intel,
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:53.880]  Val: with the hack on the chips, there's a whole new,
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:57.720]  Val: it's like a whole new industry, but there's a whole new,
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:02.440]  Val: what's the word, like a way to get at data,
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.560]  Val: I can't remember the names of them
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.920]  Val: because it's, my brain's not 100% today,
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.720]  Val: but the ones, the Intel chips, the flaws
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.000]  Val: that were found about a year and a half ago,
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.120]  Val: do you remember what you know what I'm talking about?
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:13.960]  Fed: The vulnerability, thank you.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:14.800]  Val: What's it called?
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.640]  Fed: Vulnerability?
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:17.480]  Fed: Yeah, but what were the names of the ghost one?
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:18.600]  Fed: Well, no, no, no, I don't,
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:21.240]  Fed: I think the noise might be one of these problems. [???]
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:22.960]  Val: So the things Intel fucked up,
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.120]  Val: and from the very beginning when we started making chips,
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120]  Val: there was a cache, or a cache, or whether you can,
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.800]  Val: yes, we could get all the credentials back
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:36.120]  Val: from the actual chip, and every single computer
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:39.240]  Val: in the world is vulnerable to this, every single computer,
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:41.000]  Val: and that's fucking amazing, right?
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.080]  Val: So that gives you completely new access,
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.840]  Val: and three different companies found this out at the same time.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.640]  Val: It's like the 100th monkey hearing.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.440]  Val: Do you know the thing?
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.280]  Val: The 100th monkey?
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.120]  Fed: Yeah, the 100th monkey.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.520]  Val: Great, yeah, it's just, the idea has sort of happened.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.760]  Val: But anyway, yeah, that's a whole new way of doing it.
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:57.760]  Val: I know how to do,
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.160]  Val: my best thing is social engineering,
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.560]  Val: and then, you know, I'm not really a coder.
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:06.400]  Val: I don't know how to do it,
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.160]  Val: but I can take other people's programs
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:11.680]  Val: and use them very well, you know?
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:14.200]  Val: Elcomsoft kind of pisses me off a little bit.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.520]  Val: These guys, they overdo it, but,
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.440]  Val: I mean, I have magnet, [sic] I have Elcomsoft,
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.000]  Val: I have the orange one.
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.520]  Val: I can't remember, I can't remember what it's called.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.440]  Val: Belkasoft, there's no issue, you know what?
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:30.280]  Val: Oh, you know what?
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:33.160]  Val: I'll show you, I'll show you what I got.
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:35.120]  Val: You know, magnet is the best right now.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:37.440]  Val: See, and I'm thinking, like, why go through,
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:40.800]  Val: why do all this extra work you don't need to do
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.040]  Val: if you can just get the fucking,
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.240]  Val: someone's already built the program,
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:46.200]  Val: why go out there and invent the wheel, right?
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:51.200]  Val: So if, for example, if Elcomsoft, oh shit,
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:53.360]  Val: let me see the options,
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:58.600]  Val: if Elcomsoft is already created a way
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:02.040]  Val: to get the tar ball off your iPhone 11,
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:04.120]  Val: why do I have to create a program
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:04.960]  Val: that do the same thing,
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.920]  Val: that you've got people that spend a lot of time
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.080]  Val: and money doing it?
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.280]  Val: So I'll just use their shit
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:11.240]  Val: and improvise with other people's shit.
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.640]  Val: Like, the pineapple is not that great, you know?
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.640]  Val: It's not that interesting.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.520]  Val: And also it's a little, it's not user-friendly, you know?
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.520]  Val: It's like you have to really sit down and study
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:25.120]  Val: the fucking stupid pineapple and what not to do it.
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.160]  Val: So I build a, like a fast way to do it for my girlfriend
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:29.120]  Val: because she wanted to know how to do it,
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.520]  Val: but she had no patience to sit down
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:35.520]  Val: and learn how to keep the AP or the evil twin thing. [sic]
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:38.520]  Val: You know, so I just showed her like a,
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.600]  Val: I created like a shortcut for her, which is sort of-
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.840]  Fed: How did you make it easier for her?
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:50.000]  Val: I automated it, yeah.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.400]  Val: It's easier if you do that,
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:52.720]  Val: because she just does one thing,
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:55.120]  Val: everything falls into place instead of making her,
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:58.240]  Val: it makes her think like she's accomplished something, you know?
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.120]  Val: It's not that hard to just automate, let me see, you know.
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:05.560]  Val: Sorry, so let me show you, for example.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.360]  Val: Oh, Evan Tree [???] was the other one.
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.920]  Fed: The other one is her Wi-Fi off, it's Bluetooth off.
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:11.760]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:13.560]  Val: Of course, of course.
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.600]  Val: Your security and ours, but-
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.240]  Val: Oh, really?
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:19.280]  Val: You guys got people, interesting.
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.600]  Val: Yeah, I mean, I think, sorry, I got all excited,
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.000]  Val: but I forgot that you guys were with the FBI.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  Val: Shit, okay, yeah, Wi-Fi's off, Bluetooth is off.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.120]  Val: So let's pull up, like phone breaker,
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.720]  Val: Xcode, I can do, I don't know,
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:43.840]  Val: can you be more specific, is there something you're looking for?
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.360]  Fed: Trying to assess your level of skill
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.080]  Fed: would like need your help to do something.
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:47.920]  Val: Okay.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.080]  Fed: You know, we needed you to look at, you know,
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.520]  Fed: vulnerable website or something like that,
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.040]  Fed: is that something you could do?
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:54.880]  Val: Oh.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:57.080]  Fed: You know, if we had a phone, we'd be pretty good.
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.640]  Val: The phone I could do a lot better
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.960]  Val: than I could with the vulnerable website.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:03.320]  Val: I could do the website, but it would take me a little extra time,
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.680]  Val: because I have not studied that one as much.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.840]  Val: I mean, I used to do it before,
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:10.720]  Val: maybe when it was easy, when everything was on the server,
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.800]  Val: and you could just do it through the back space.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:15.400]  Val: Remember, you could just do that stupid thing,
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.440]  Val: you know, maybe I could do that.
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.240]  Val: But the phone is more fun for me, that's easy,
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.040]  Val: that's not easy, but it's more of a challenge.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.840]  Val: Because I did my dad's phone, I did my girlfriend's phone,
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.920]  Val: and then people would find phones on the street for me
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:29.400]  Val: and just sell it to me, it's just like a phone practice.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.720]  Val: It is fun, that's what I like.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.360]  Val: And the remote stuff is,
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.160]  Val: well, am I gonna get in trouble
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:40.240]  Val: for telling you guys any of this shit?
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.920]  Fed: You told me like you murdered someone,
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.800]  Val: I never murdered anybody, okay?
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.520]  Val: No murder, okay?
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.120]  Val: The New York Times asked me to hack Epstein.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.160]  Val: Okay, so David wanted me to hack Epstein.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.200]  Val: So I did it, and everyone's very,
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.120]  Val: I didn't, oh sorry, I didn't do it.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.280]  Val: I started the process of doing it,
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.400]  Val: and I gave him the list of passwords,
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:07.440]  Val: and I gave him the list,
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:09.200]  Val: and I have this on email to prove to you,
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.680]  Val: okay, the passwords, and I gave him the list of logins,
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:13.440]  Val: that's it, all the credentials.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.360]  Val: And I gave him the Ghislane's credentials as well.
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:19.840]  Val: I did not break in, I did try, okay, made an attempt,
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.320]  Val: but it was a double authentication,
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.440]  Val: someone already got to it.
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:26.660]  Val: I don't know whose number it is,
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:28.920]  Val: but I have a phone number if you wanna trace it,
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.480]  Val: it would be helpful for you guys.
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.640]  Val: And I found out a lot, for Kevin Hall,
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.720]  Val: actually, I did this one in the morning.
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:40.800]  Val: I know someone who's running around, so.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.640]  Oh, Kevin Hall is doing this one in the morning,
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.600]  Val: and he's a partner with me,
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.360]  Val: he wrote the Epstein story.
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.640]  Val: Yeah, he's really good, really good, yeah.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:59.880]  Val: [unintelligible] money laundering
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.520]  Val: so I helped him by just looking at his old email addresses
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.440]  Val: from like 1999, old banks that he used in old,
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:13.520]  Val: just old accounts, and lawyers that he used as well,
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:16.120]  Val: because a lot of the lawyers are hiding some money too.
[02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:18.760]  Val: Stuff like that, yeah.
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:24.000]  Val: Just, you know, I usually don't give away a secret,
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.240]  Val: but I'll give you a secret,
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.360]  Val: and it'll make it seem so mundane and obvious to you,
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.320]  Val: you'll think like, why didn't I think of that?
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:31.280]  Val: It's the easiest possible way to start,
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:33.960]  Val: and mostly, people ask you to find a password,
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.240]  Val: this is the easiest thing to do.
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:38.960]  Val: You just get a database of the billion or so
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:40.600]  Val: already hacked files,
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:43.480]  Val: you find the old password that somebody used,
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:45.600]  Val: and you just sort of engineer from there,
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.760]  Val: it's not that hard, yeah.
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.280]  Val: A lot of people don't change their passwords,
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:52.160]  Val: and when they do, they make a variation.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.000]  Fed: That's all you have.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:53.840]  Val: Right.
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:57.720]  Fed: I assume you usually work alone, do you work with other people?
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:02.720]  Val: No, no, I don't understand how you work with,
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:07.200]  Val: I mean, teach me, there's a way to work with other people,
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.280]  Val: yeah, teach me, because usually, I don't know,
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:12.080]  Val: like usually it's one person doing all the work,
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.960]  Val: and the other person is watching, so, I don't know.
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.440]  Val: But yeah, I'd like to, I would love to try, I mean.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.080]  Fed: Yeah, like I said, right now I'm completely list of stuff
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:27.680]  Fed: that like, okay, we could use help on this,
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:29.320]  Fed: so it's maybe something that we could do.
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:31.360]  Fed: We could try to find a spot for you, still.
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.160]  Fed: I feel like it's that, I guess, on my head.
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.200]  Val: What I'm really good at doing is I could find
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:37.920]  Val: stolen money and money laundering.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:39.280]  Val: If someone needs to move money,
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:40.680]  Val: I can show you how to do that.
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:44.080]  Val: I know how to, I know people that can reverse engineer,
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:48.160]  Val: there's a word for it, Bitcoin wallets?
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.920]  Reverse [???], what do you call it?
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:51.840]  Fed: Well, how do they, how do they,
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:54.320]  Fed: do you mean, they're gonna track where the Bitcoin goes,
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.200]  Val: no, they can find, no, how, where it came from.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:00.840]  Val: They can do the whole scrub, they call it,
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:03.000]  Val: it's not scrub, it's called the,
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.240]  Fed: they're watching it now, like you're telling,
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:08.840]  Fed: because it's all public, so that you can see
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:09.720]  Fed: where it goes to and from,
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:11.400]  Fed: you mean after it's been tumbled or something?
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:12.720]  Val: After it's been, yes.
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:15.240]  Val: Not tumbled, after it's been put into any wallet.
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:18.640]  Val: They can trace it, like a reverse trace.
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:20.600]  Val: There's two people I know that can do it.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:22.600]  Fed:That part's not too difficult, I'll tell you.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:23.440]  Val: It's not, okay.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:24.920]  Val: Oh, you can?
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.400]  Val: Okay, I don't know anything about it.
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.880]  Fed: And it's just like the ledger is public,
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:30.040]  Fed: so you can see where the money comes and goes to.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.160]  Fed:It's just that this number means nothing.
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.320]  Val: Oh, no, but it's not that simple.
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.160]  Val: I mean, yeah, I know there's an open ledger,
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:42.600]  Val: but it's also, there's like a wallet
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.400]  Val: that has self-account as well,
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.480]  Val: so you have to find out where it, yeah.
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.800]  Val: It's like, they know how to do that.
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.080]  Val: They can, they can,
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.160]  Val: I'm not sure what the wording is.
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.040]  Val: You see, that would be nice.
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:57.280]  Val: I would like to know what the terms are for these things.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:59.360]  Val: I know how to do it, I know what the action is,
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:02.320]  Val: but I don't know the term, the term, the terminology.
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:06.960]  Fed: Okay, so what other stuff do you have access to?
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:09.240]  Fed: I mean, because you have access to a lot of journalists, right?
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:10.600]  Fed: And here's the thing.
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:12.720]  Fed: I don't really want to deal with journalists
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.200]  Fed: because it's the [unintelligible] stuff that's there.
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.360]  Val: Journalists have a lot of data.
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:20.560]  Val: They're a very untapped source of data.
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:22.560]  Val: You know, if you know how to say the right thing,
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:25.080]  Val: you can get all, I got the guys in Russia,
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:27.520]  Val: there was a spy on trial,
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.800]  Val: he's a banker spy, and I got the guy
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.040]  Val: to send me the whole fucking transcripts,
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:33.040]  Val: court records, everything.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.360]  Fedl: You mean the journalist was able
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.280]  Fed: to get the court records in 2017?
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.960]  Fed: Yes, okay, yes, interesting.
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.760]  Val: Journalists have a lot of shit,
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.560]  Val: and they just sit on it and just goes,
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:45.000]  Val: once the story's done, they forget about it.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:45.920]  Val: They don't need it anymore.
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:50.080]  Val: So there's a huge fucking great source of information.
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:52.840]  Val: Nobody even bothers to get it.
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:54.760]  Val: But I know so many journalists now,
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:56.400]  Val: and they're sending me shit all the time.
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:58.800]  Val: People, I just have this guy named,
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.720]  Val: well, I'm not gonna tell you his name,
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.920]  Val: because that would be kind of weird.
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.160]  Val: It would be rude to do that, too.
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:05.880]  Val: But he just found me on Twitter and said,
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.880]  Val: I think that there's some shady shit
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.000]  Val: going on in the Bank of Ireland.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.360]  Val: Can you take a look at this one?
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.920]  Val: And I guess, I take a look at it,
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:17.920]  Val: and lo and behold, Wilbur Ross stole $35 billion
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.280]  Val: from Bank of Ireland.
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.960]  Val: Well, Wilbur Ross and his compatriots,
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:27.960]  Val: but 23, he calls them hedge funds because they're not hedge
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:31.160]  Val: funds, they're more like LSEs.
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.560]  Val: But 23 of them that he owns, Wilbur Ross owns, okay?
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.520]  Val: Bank of Ireland hid $35 billion in promissory bonds, sorry.
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:46.920]  Val: He bought a portion of that bank for 1% for like,
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.000]  Val: like something so touchy, like a couple billion dollars.
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.840]  Val: And his, that share gave him access to $35 billion,
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:57.720]  Val: which he pulled out, and it's fucking amazing.
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:58.680]  Val: It's amazing.
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.000]  Val: So look, I get shit like that,
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.440]  Val: but then I get the weird spy people, you know?
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.400]  Val: Like the crazy people, they're not crazy.
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.640]  Val: They're, sometimes they're reading a script.
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:09.440]  Val: Like, I don't know if they're intelligence
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:11.000]  Val: from corporate intelligence,
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.680]  Val: or if they're actual state-run intelligence.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.040]  Val: I can't tell.
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:16.000]  Val: Like this guy, Kaiser Soze, right?
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  Val: So he's, he did a very classic move where you,
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:25.680]  Val: instead of going right for me, he goes to people around me,
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.160]  Val: and then they start talking about,
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.960]  Val: and I'm like, oh, who's this guy you're talking about?
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:29.800]  Val: Right?
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:30.640]  Val: And that's how I get hooked.
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:32.840]  Val: And I saw that coming a mile away, right?
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:34.600]  Val: So I was like, okay, I'm here.
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:35.800]  Val: What do you want to say?
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.520]  Val: And he won't tell me what his real name.
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:40.920]  Val: And he goes into this story, it's very specific,
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.600]  Val: and it's very good, and I really wish it was true,
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:44.960]  Val: but I don't believe it is.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.480]  Val: But I do believe that 60 to 40% of it,
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:54.160]  Val: somewhere over this bridge of the 50% mark, is true.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.360]  Val: It makes sense.
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:57.720]  Val: Trump, there was a meeting in Deutsche Bank,
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:59.400]  Val: he says, when my father was there,
[02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:01.000]  Val: and he, it's a lie, my father was never there.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.600]  Val: I checked his schedule, he did not go to this meeting.
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:05.800]  Val: And Jurgen Fitchison was not there either.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:06.960]  Val: He claims he was there.
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:10.160]  Val: And two people from Natsutzky were there,
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:12.040]  Val: and he was one of them, right?
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.520]  Val: He says that they came in to buy a CLO,
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:18.600]  Val: which is a collateralized loan obligation.
[02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:20.920]  Val: It's basically a structured product.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:25.920]  Val: It's a, it's a whole shitload of mortgages
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.360]  Val: put together into one bundle that you can buy.
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:31.680]  Val: And it's like a bank-to-bank thing.
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:33.560]  Val: You can't, it probably gives no [???] access to it.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.520]  Val: So they thought they were gonna get rid of this,
[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:38.800]  Val: this charge, and sell it to Natsutzky.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:40.720]  Val: And the guy said, well, the problem is,
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:43.360]  Val: we don't want you to buy it, we just want you to look at it
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.040]  Val: and tell us what you think.
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.000]  Val: And tell us where you see the problem.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.560]  Val: So they looked at it and they saw that,
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.560]  Val: to make this long story short,
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:54.160]  Val: Donald Trump did not sign a consenting agreement.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:56.600]  Val: Okay, so if you have a,
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:59.800]  Val: if you guys are all in a trust, right,
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:02.040]  Val: that means that you're all shared,
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.440]  Val: it's sort of the money that's pooled together.
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:08.280]  Val: Let's say you wanted to borrow $5 million
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.280]  Val: to start a golf course, right?
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.040]  Val: But you don't tell these guys.
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.800]  Val: You take it, you take the $5 million,
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:14.640]  Val: you don't tell them,
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:16.640]  Val: and you don't sign a consenting agreement.
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:20.120]  Val: If you fail, they have to pay your debt, right?
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.880]  Val: If you sign a consenting agreement,
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.040]  Val: then they're free, right?
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:26.680]  Val: They're not liable for your debt if you fail.
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:27.520]  Val: But you made money,
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.120]  Val: you bring it back in and put it in the pool,
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.640]  Val: and everyone's very happy, except that you didn't,
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:35.120]  Val: they overlooked the fact that you didn't sign this agreement.
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:37.760]  Val: Now, Trump didn't sign three of them, right?
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.400]  Val: Which means the people at Deutsche Bank
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:43.440]  Val: and the high net worth individuals at DBTCA specifically
[02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:46.080]  Val: will be very upset to know that,
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.360]  Val: and it would cause a run on DBTCA.
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:52.800]  Val: Now, and DBTCA has $23 billion going for it,
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:56.840]  Val: and they still don't have a fucking chief risk officer,
[02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.480]  Val: all right, $23 billion.
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:03.480]  Val: That is a 700 person entity, all right?
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:06.920]  Val: There's 25,000 Deutsche Bank America,
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:08.800]  Val: 700 people in DBTCA.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.520]  Val: It's very secretive, it's a weird place,
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.080]  Val: and that's where my dad,
[02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:15.120]  Val: that's where they put my father when he died,
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.320]  Val: when he killed himself.
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:19.480]  Val: There's a French guy that runs it,
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.040]  Val: and he was supposedly at this meeting as well.
[02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.360]  Val: Now, I'll just, fuck it, I'll just tell you.
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:31.360]  Val: The first guy is Rebolyev, signed off on the loan, okay?
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:35.280]  Val: The second one is, I don't believe him,
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.840]  Val: because I fed him the answer, and I fucked up.
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:40.280]  Val: You know when you say, oh, did you hear the word
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:41.760]  Val: Victor Bexelberg in the room?
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:43.520]  Val: He goes, oh yeah, that's it, right?
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.320]  Val: Fuck, I shouldn't have said that, yeah.
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:48.200]  Val: So he claims Victor Bexelberg was number two,
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.000]  Val: and number three is interesting,
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.040]  Val: I didn't believe him until yesterday,
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:55.280]  Val: because something interesting happened yesterday.
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:59.680]  Val: He said that SpareBank signed on behalf,
[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:01.440]  Val: a person signed on behalf of SpareBank,
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:03.440]  Val: not anyone you've heard of, but as,
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:06.760]  Val: sorry, I'm sorry, not SpareBank, Gazprom.
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:09.680]  Val: Gazprom is [??] an entity signed off on a loan.
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:11.000]  Val: I'm like, what the fuck, how can an entity
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:11.840]  Val: sign off on a loan?
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:13.120]  Val: I've never heard of that.
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:16.680]  Val: Until yesterday, when this Irish guy I was telling about
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:20.800]  Val: sends me a, they call it charges,
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:23.720]  Val: they call it in Ireland, they call them charges mortgages,
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:24.560]  Val: right?
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:28.200]  Val: He sends me this, I have it right here if you wanna see it,
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:34.040]  Val: this charge of some land that was sold in Ireland
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.280]  Val: by Deutsche Bank.
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.680]  Val: So Deutsche Bank, as a bank, is an entity liable for it.
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:40.280]  Val: I was like, holy shit, it does,
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:42.600]  Val: and that's very, I've never seen that before.
[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:44.640]  Val: And he asked me, I've never seen this before,
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.040]  Val: and I have not answered him yet,
[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:48.120]  Val: I'm not gonna tell him yes, you know,
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:50.000]  Val: because I don't know who the fuck he's doing,
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.640]  Val: where his game is.
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:54.840]  Val: He's telling me that he wants to find a proper journalist,
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:56.640]  Val: he wants Ronan Farrow, so I'm like, okay fine,
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.880]  Val: here's Ronan Farrow, give him a Ronan Farrow,
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:01.680]  Val: but he's still sending me documents, so I don't know.
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:07.840]  Val: And it's, things like that happen a lot, so, yeah.
[02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:09.000]  Fed: So what do you wanna, like, you know,
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.760]  Fed: economic fraud type stuff, it's good information.
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:14.880]  Fed: If that's the case too, we'll probably pass it to
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:17.320]  Fed: an economic fraud agent, if you can help out too.
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:19.080]  Val: Sure.
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:21.800]  Fed: What other, like, are you involved in any hacking groups?
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:25.160]  Fed: Do you know of any hacking groups that you can get into?
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:26.400]  Fed: Like, yeah, a dark net type thing.
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:31.400]  Val: Well, I mean, is this like, what if I say yes, am I in trouble?
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.840]  Val: Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's one group.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:37.440]  Fed: Because obviously the FBI monitors a lot of these things,
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:38.840]  Fed: and you like to see, you know, what's going on.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:40.880]  Val: Yeah, you guys are in that signal group, aren't you?
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.120]  Fed: What signal group?
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:43.760]  Val: Which one?
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:45.680]  Val: There's a bunch of signal groups.
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:48.640]  Val: There's one, I know there's some people that we checked,
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:50.320]  Val: and there's some like, brand new,
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:53.360]  Val: limited identities for some people,
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.040]  Val: we don't know where they came from, so.
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:57.280]  Val: I thought it was either FBI, or it was like,
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:59.480]  Val: some spies or something, so I don't know.
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:02.320]  Fed: In the signal group, so the signal group,
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.520]  Fed: there's a bunch of new identities?
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:05.920]  Val: Well, it's not, there's a couple of,
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.680]  Val: more than one signal group, so there's a group of people,
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:10.040]  Val: and they're not all hackers, it's like,
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.000]  Val: it's a mix of very interesting people.
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.600]  Val: Yeah, yeah, it's like, some of the greatest journalists,
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:17.720]  Val: and some of the greatest hackers,
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:19.280]  Val: and some of the greatest activists,
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.160]  Val: some of the greatest writers, you know,
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:24.360]  Val: and some just fucking fine, interesting people.
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.800]  Val: You know, everyone's having a conversation,
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.400]  Val: but specifically a hacking group, no.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.160]  Val: But there's like, different variations of these signal groups,
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:33.800]  Val: and this one is Barrett, so.
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:34.920]  Val: When he said Houston, I was like,
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:36.800]  Val: oh fuck, he's after Barrett Brown.
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:40.040]  Fed: Barrett's on the radar, I mean.
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:40.880]  Val: Yeah?
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:42.440]  Fed: Like, but you know that, I mean,
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.440]  Fed: he's been arrested already.
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:48.200]  Val: I know, he's in rehab right now, yeah, okay, good so, yeah.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:50.080]  Fed: Well, what's Barrett up to, do you talk to him?
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:51.320]  Val: Yeah, I talk to him all the time,
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:53.600]  Val: he pisses me off, he's a little fucking shit,
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.800]  Val: because he's supposed to write great,
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.800]  Val: huge, thunderous story against Val versus David Enrich,
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.240]  Val: but he got too high, and just fucking forgot about it.
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:06.680]  Val: Well, not forgot about it, just didn't do it.
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:09.000]  Val: So, and he hasn't even apologized yet,
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.400]  Val: so I'm very pissed off.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  Val: And I've got reams and reams of texts with him, so, yeah.
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:19.440]  Val: And he's a good guy, but he doesn't know shit about computers.
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:20.920]  Val: He's not an hacker.
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:22.800]  Fed: He was part of a Anonymous for a good bit.
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:24.840]  Val: Yeah, but he's a talker, he's not an hacker.
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:27.520]  Val: No, you barely know how to do that.
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:30.080]  Val: He couldn't find his key chain.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.040]  Val: Seriously, he doesn't know shit.
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:34.360]  Val: That's the funny part about Barrett,
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:36.680]  Val: he doesn't know anything about computers.
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:37.520]  Val: Yeah.
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:38.520]  Fed: So, does Barrett [unintelligible]
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:42.840]  Val: No, no, no, he's, you know, just,
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:45.160]  Val: he's kind of like, the reason I have some respect for him
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:47.800]  Val: is because he's sort of, like, on this vengeful path
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:48.960]  Val: that I understand now.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.440]  Val: I've never been on a vengeful path before,
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:54.000]  Val: but now I understand it, I've started it,
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.400]  Val: and I know that's what he's doing too.
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.480]  Val: Like, whatever happened with the FBI and him.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:00.520]  Val: But I don't know, I just think it's hilarious
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:03.360]  Val: when he got raided and he was live on the webcam.
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:04.840]  Val: I just thought that was funny, I don't know.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.640]  Val: But then he fucking, I told him,
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:10.040]  Val: I actually recorded this conversation,
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:12.640]  Val: I told him, like, look, dude, where you fucked up
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:15.520]  Val: is where you went after the FBI agent's family.
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:16.760]  Val: That was stupid.
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:18.880]  Val: You must understand how dumb that was.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.840]  Val: "Yes, but, you know, I was already
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:22.080]  Val: "gonna be put in jail anyway,"
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:25.280]  Val: so, come on, bro, you could have avoided a lot of shit
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:27.400]  Val: if you just didn't do that stupid shit.
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:30.120]  Val: So he has an ego that won't,
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.240]  Val: that's his biggest issue, his ego.
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:36.240]  Val: He can't drop it for a second.
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.240]  Val: He doesn't have the humility or the ability to try.
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:44.320]  Val: That's the problem.
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.880]  Val: That's why you can't trust someone like that in here.
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:49.000]  Fed: Do you guys talk over Signal?
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.560]  Val: Yeah, yeah.
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.560]  Val: Well, again, I was trying to help him.
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.160]  Val: He had no where, he's like homeless now,
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:57.160]  Val: with his weird girlfriend, so I was trying to help him.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.280]  Val: You know, I got him a couple of hotel rooms,
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.120]  Val: I sent him some money, he was like, you know,
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:05.480]  Val: and then my girlfriend goes out of her way to,
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:07.760]  Val: sorry, now I'm just complaining, but she goes,
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:09.600]  Val: out of her way to get him a place to live
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  Val: for like a month, so he's off the streets,
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.640]  Val: he doesn't have to worry about food and shit,
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:15.840]  Val: he can just work, because she's like,
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:18.280]  Val: do the thing where he fucking promised he promised us,
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:19.880]  Val: like, here's a place to live.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.040]  Val: And instead of just going there and saying thank you
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.400]  Val: and doing it, he just like,
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.720]  Val: creates this whole chaotic thing of like,
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.360]  Val: well, you didn't tell me to call this day,
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:31.200]  Val: and you know, like this minutiae,
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:32.720]  Val: so he sabotages the whole thing,
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:33.640]  Val: and then at the end I'm like
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.560]  Val: you know what, Barrett, go fuck yourself.
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.480]  Val: I don't, it's not opening anymore,
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.040]  Val: the windows closed, it's done.
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:42.400]  Val: And he's like, fuck you, I'm Barrett, you know.
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.120]  Val: No, and I ignore him, the more I ignore him,
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.080]  Val: the more he wants your attention.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:47.320]  Fed: Where is he now,
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.400]  Fed: I mean, where in rehab, is it in Dallas [???] or?
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:54.240]  Val: Do you really want to know?
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:55.760]  Fed: I was just curious, I mean, like.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.720]  Val: You're like, what?
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:28:59.000]  Fed: No, maybe, you don't want to tell,
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:28:59.840]  Fed: you don't have to tell.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:02.560]  Val: No, I, I, I think it's important,
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:05.600]  Val: I think I want to know what and why.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.400]  Val: Like, if I'm going to take the accountability
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:08.680]  Val: of doing something to somebody here,
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:10.560]  Val: I'm going to get someone in trouble or put in jail,
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.880]  Val: I would like to know who it is,
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:13.880]  Val: why I'm doing it and what for it.
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:14.720]  Val: You know what I mean?
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:16.440]  Fed: I get it, I mean, I'll tell you this right now,
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:19.560]  Fed: I can't tell you everything we do, right?
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.960]  Fed: Like I said, I'll be honest with you
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:22.520]  Fed: as much as you're going to be honest with me.
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.240]  Fed: I can't tell you the motivation behind
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:26.120]  Fed: every single question I ask,
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.160]  Fed: because there's a lot of things that the FBI does,
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:31.400]  Fed: like if we had an investigation into whatever,
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:34.480]  I don't know, call it Barrett Brown, for example.
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:36.320]  Fed: And you wanted to know why, and it's because,
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.440]  Fed: oh, we're going to arrest him tomorrow, right?
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:40.720]  Fed: And then you don't say, hey, Barrett, by the way,
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.280]  Fed:  the FBI's going to fuck you tomorrow.
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:43.120]  Val: Yeah.
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:44.960]  Fed: It probably wouldn't go well for us, right?
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:47.240]  Val: So that would have to be my choice, right?
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:48.080]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:51.280]  Fed: So everything you could tell is totally up to you, right?
[02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:53.120]  Fed: Like I'm not forcing you to give anything,
[02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:53.960]  Fed: you're here on your own.
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:56.200]  Val: Well, I'm not going to give you a Barrett Brown right now.
[02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:57.920]  Val: If there's something that he's done
[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:00.520]  Val: that you feel you want to know,
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:02.280]  Val: or if this is a vendetta thing,
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:04.680]  Val: then I don't want to be part of the vendetta.
[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:05.520]  Fed: Don't worry about that.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.680]  Fed: I mean, I'm trying to assess what information you have,
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:10.360]  Fed: because whenever he's up there, I'm in Houston, so like.
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.400]  Val: Sure, you know, I've got a Jeremy Hammond,
[02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:15.480]  Val: Gregg Housh, all the guys, all these people.
[02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:17.200]  Fed: Because like that's the other thing we have to assess too,
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:18.520]  Fed: is if you're not willing to help.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.080]  Val: But Gregg worked with you, Gregg worked with you already.
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:23.200]  Val: Gregg worked with you guys.
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:25.240]  Val: He's already been helpful, you know.
[02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:26.080]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:27.760]  Fed: Like that's the thing is we're collecting
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:29.760]  Fed: a lot of information on a lot of different things, right?
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:30.600]  Fed: Right.
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:33.280]  Fed: So part of it is, it's going to be a one-way street
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:34.280]  Fed: of information this way.
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:36.400]  Fed: I can't give you all the information that's,
[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.840]  Fed: so like if that's what you expect, then, you know,
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.000]  Fed: it's no hard feelings, and we part ways, and it's just fun.
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.840]  Fed: Because I can't tell you everything we do, because.
[02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:45.680]  Val: I know, I don't.
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:47.320]  Fed: You don't know me, I don't know you either.
[02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:49.160]  Val: I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:50.240]  Val: I don't.
[02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:53.480]  Val: No expectations, I just, if it's something that is,
[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:59.800]  Val: if I mean, I'm going to be accountable for someone's life,
[02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:02.840]  Val: I'd really like to think it through, you know.
[02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:03.680]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:06.480]  Val: I mean, if you want me to blindly follow orders.
[02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:08.560]  Val: I mean, I will right now,
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:11.040]  Val: because Marlowe's life is in jeopardy, of course.
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.600]  Val: I'll do whatever the fuck you want to save Marlowe,
[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:16.080]  Val: but at a certain, after that, you know,
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:18.240]  Val: I will have to draw a line or something.
[02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:19.440]  Fed: And I, so here's the thing,
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:21.640]  Fed: I want you to be as conscious of the decision.
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:23.200]  Fed: Let's take Marlow's whole way out of the situation.
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:24.040]  Val: Okay.
[02:31:24.040 --> 02:31:26.840]  Fed: And you resolve Marlowe, everything's both copacetic.
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:28.800]  Fed: I want you to make the same decision as her then,
[02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:29.680]  Fed: as you would before that.
[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:31.400]  Val: Okay, well then, that depends on you.
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:33.880]  Val: If I like you guys, and I believe that this is,
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:36.840]  Val: you are like Tim and Jammy, and like you, again,
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.800]  Val: if they told, sent you to me, then I'm trusting them.
[02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:42.760]  Val: I believe you guys are the good people,
[02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:45.280]  Val: because there are some bad people in the FBI.
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.160]  Val: All right, there's some really fucking shits.
[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.760]  Val: In every, not just the FBI, but everywhere.
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:51.680]  Val: And it's hard to find them and negotiate.
[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:53.560]  Val: And you know, my read on you right now
[02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:56.240]  Val: is that you're a very highly intelligent guy.
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.680]  Val: You know, but you're hiding something from me right now,
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.520]  Val: and you haven't still,
[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:01.560]  Val: you still haven't told me you're hiding something right now.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.720]  Val: And you are here to suss me out
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:04.240]  Val: from a totally different point of view.
[02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:06.320]  Val: I'm not sure what point of view that is.
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:08.600]  Val: And you are here to completely give
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:10.240]  Val: the female point of view.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:11.440]  Fed: Oh, wow.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:13.840]  Val: I'm joking.
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:17.760]  Val: You have a whole other case that you need help on,
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.320]  Val: which is not even related to this,
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:21.400]  Val: but I'm trying to figure out what that is for.
[02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:23.840]  Val: But you seem more like a New York-style person,
[02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:25.240]  Val: not an LA person.
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:27.120]  Val: So I'm thinking you've got to be,
[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:29.480]  Val: you've got to be closer than Tim,
[02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:32.040]  Val: and you've got to be with Desky and Lyne.
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:35.480]  Val: No, not with Desky and Lyne.
[02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:39.920]  Val: Anyway, so, but your thing's unrelated to their thing,
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:40.760]  Val: right?
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:42.440]  Val: Am I close?
[02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:44.400]  Val: Okay.
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:45.560]  Fed: [unintelligible]
[02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.520]  Val: That's okay, but that's what you tell me,
[02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:49.360]  Val: and then I,
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:50.200]  Fed: So, it's a matter of thinking.
[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:51.280]  Fed: I'm trying to assess you.
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:52.960]  Fed: The thing is,
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.080]  Fed: We're being straight up.
[02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:55.920]  Fed: Yep.
[02:32:55.920 --> 02:32:59.040]  Fed: I mean, I think [unintelligible]
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:00.520]  Fed: you know, they're wrong,
[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:04.720]  Fed: and we do this job for the right reasons.
[02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:06.200]  Fed: There are bad apples out there,
[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:09.160]  Fed: and that's not what you've got across.
[02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:10.040]  Val: That's right.
[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:15.440]  Fed: I think the fact that when we listen to you,
[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:17.920]  Fed: and we ask you questions about Marlowe,
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:22.280]  Fed: That's not even worse than having a family to report.
[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:24.040]  Fed: And you've been through that.
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:25.560]  Fed: You know, you have a history.
[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:26.400]  Val: I have,
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:28.440]  Val: but I have to also question you and think,
[02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.440]  Val: well, you know, I mean, I could be any way,
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:31.560]  Val: what if I'm the bad guy,
[02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:32.760]  Val: and I'm sitting here talking to you.
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:34.760]  Val: So do you have to figure out,
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.600]  Val: where am I,
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:37.440]  Val: am I the good person or the bad person, right?
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:38.640]  Val: I told you my side of the story.
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:40.520]  Val: Of course, I'm gonna make myself look good.
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:42.600]  Val: You guys have to do your background on me.
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:44.120]  Val: So I figured, have you already done it?
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:45.280]  Val: If I would not be sitting here,
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:46.120]  Val: if you hadn't done it,
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:48.040]  Val: I'd already figured out I was the good guy.
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:49.800]  Val: So I'm gonna have to trust you on that.
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:50.720]  Val: That's what I,
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:53.760]  Val: now I could be jumping to conclusions here,
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:55.720]  Val: but that's why I figured it is happening, right?
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:57.000]  Fed: So you're right on that part,
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.560]  Fed: because I wouldn't bring you in here
[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:01.040]  Fed: in a situation like this,
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:02.640]  Fed: if you were my target, right?
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:04.560]  Fed: If you were my target, we would arrest of you.
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.400]  Val: Right, right.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.320]  Fed: That being said,
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:09.520]  Fed: we're still trying to figure each other out, right?
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:10.360]  Fed: Yeah.
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:11.680]  Fed: We need to figure out what our role is,
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:12.920]  Fed: and we're trying to figure out
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:15.000]  Fed: if you've got any information that can help us.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.400]  Val: So, what, oh, databases?
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.640]  Val: Yes, I do have OCCP, [sic]
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:23.080]  Val: and I did have all of Emma's stuff too,
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.560]  Val: Hunter, actually it's still available,
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.960]  Val: Hunter Archives.
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.800]  Fed: Okay.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:30.720]  Val: And the ICIJ,
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:31.560]  Val: and I've got,
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:34.720]  Fed: I don't know, so access to OCCP and,
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:36.200]  Fed: what's Hunter?
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.440]  Val: If I could show up for a second,
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:39.560]  Val: I'd have admin access to you.
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:40.400]  Val: This is really good.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:41.740]  Val: I got all the shit that I,
[02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:46.740]  Val: it was OCCP, yeah, thank you.
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:51.280]  Val: If you want my files,
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.080]  Val: then hook me up with your admin access.
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.280]  Val: I want to sell this shit, you know?
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:57.120]  Val: I can't be stuck looking at half the document.
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.480]  Val: If you want me to find the fucking money launderers,
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:01.480]  Val: you need to see the whole breadth of the thing.
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:03.360]  Val: I have to follow the whole paper trail.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.160]  Val: So, that's it.
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.800]  Fed: So, what do they have on OCCP?
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:07.640]  Fed: I've heard about it.
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.480]  Val: So much shit, so much shit.
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:10.400]  Val: Dude, it's great.
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:12.240]  Val: It's great, everything, everything.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.080]  Val: Every, I mean, Panama Papers, you know, everything.
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:18.840]  Val: All my shit is there, you know?
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:20.640]  Val: All of Emma's stuff is there.
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:25.000]  Val: So, Hunter Archives would be the DDoS Secrets and Emma's stuff.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.720]  Val: And then that server got.
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:29.280]  Val: raided in Germany and one in America or something.
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:30.120]  Val: Which is a shame,
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:31.720]  Val: because it was like a public service that archive.
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:33.240]  Val: It was really good.
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:38.320]  Val: But it's like a, that was her big coup de grace out there,
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:41.200]  Val: her big tiara on her head sort of thing.
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:43.760]  Val: What's the word I'm talking about here?
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:44.600]  Fed: Her baby or what?
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:45.760]  Val: Yeah, whatever it is.
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:49.880]  Val: But it's also, that's like one 20th of the OCCP.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.160]  Val: Who's Emma Best and why is she important?
[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:56.160]  Val: You know, I don't think she's important.
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:57.440]  Val: Actually, I think she's full of shit.
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.360]  Val: She says, oh, I used to work for the CIA,
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:01.000]  Val: but I can't tell you.
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:03.440]  Val: Like one of those old, you know, isn't that community?
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:05.280]  Val: Is Emma Best her real name or?
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:07.200]  Val: I don't know, okay.
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.280]  Val: All I know is that I think she is a,
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.320]  Val: I'm still trying to figure out,
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:16.280]  Val: not, you know, in any pejorative manner.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:19.480]  Val: But I think she was a man first,
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:21.320]  Val: and then became a woman, or was she a woman who became a,
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:22.280]  Val: I don't even know that.
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.920]  Val: I just know it's some sort of gender change.
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.480]  Val: And I know that her boyfriend or girlfriend,
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.960]  Val: I don't know if she was also a man first,
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:33.680]  Val: but I do know that he slash she is kind of an asshole,
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:34.640]  Val: and that's it.
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:39.640]  Val: It's like the kind of person that asked for money,
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.480]  Val: and then, like, we need money,
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:44.360]  Val: we need help because we have an autistic child.
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.360]  Val: And how do you say no to that?
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:48.760]  Val: You know, but then they sort of say,
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:52.960]  Val: go fuck yourself if you have an idea that they don't have.
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:53.960]  Val: Like in this one group,
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.960]  Val: but a friend of mine was just trying to actually Barrett.
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:00.960]  Val: was like, yeah, you know,
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.560]  Val: whatever you do, don't attack this person at this turn,
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:05.400]  Val: that this,
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:11.120]  Val: sort of a lawyer that I can't think of.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:13.640]  Val: I'm losing my speed here,
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.000]  Val: but a nonprofit, some sort of nonprofit,
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.200]  Val: don't attack the specific lawyer because he's a good guy.
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:20.840]  Val: And then she says, fuck you, he's a terrible guy.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:22.480]  Val: I can attack whoever the fuck I want.
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:27.080]  Val: And this is Emma's partner, spouse.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:30.520]  Fed: You know, they're, name is or anything?
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.800]  Val: Xan, is there a fake name, X-A-N?
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:34.640]  Val: No, X-A-N.
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:37.840]  Val: Yeah, but I think she's, like,
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:41.120]  Val: it was a whole, it's a dramatically stupid,
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:43.680]  Val: but it's like, but there was this whole drama yesterday
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:48.680]  Val: about she's working in a diner and she got sad
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:51.760]  Val: and she started crying, she couldn't contain her feelings,
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.120]  Val: and it was all melodramatic, and like, so what?
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:55.960]  Val: What are you trying to say?
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.880]  Val: If you want money, just say, can I have money?
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.400]  Val: Because we will respect you more
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:01.040]  Val: if you just come out and ask for it.
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.840]  Val: Instead of telling us how sad you are,
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.240]  Val: that you have to work in a diner, right?
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:06.600]  Val: It's like, fuck you for saying that,
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:08.960]  Val: and that's the sort of, no, I don't mean it, right?
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:09.800]  Fed: [unintelligible]
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:13.080]  Val: Yeah, yeah, you know, it's like, it's enough.
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:14.320]  Fed: You want money?
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.800]  Val: Yeah, you know, and, yeah, so.
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:21.160]  Fed: So is Xan saying a hacker or is he just doing one of these
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:25.160]  Val: yeah to be honest with you, okay.
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:30.160]  Val: I, so I felt like I hacked Deutsche Bank,
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.640]  Val: although I didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:34.120]  Val: I felt like I did a pretty good job of hacking it,
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:36.440]  Val: not directly, I didn't go into their servers and do it,
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:38.880]  Val: but I fucking hacked that bank.
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:42.160]  Val: And it, well, not maybe in the sense of a hacker,
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:43.480]  Val: you probably, if you're a proper hacker,
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.320]  Val: you would not see it.
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:46.000]  Val: But in social engineering and all the people,
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.440]  Val: when McKaylee Faisola went to jail,
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.640]  Val: I put the fucking bail, [???] too, all right?
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:52.600]  Val: I got all the data, exposed everything,
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:53.840]  Val: and there's still more to come,
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:55.360]  Val: which you don't know about, all right?
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.920]  Val: There's a lot more to come, yes.
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.160]  Val: So I, so when Emma's guy, I forgot his name,
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:06.160]  Val: the LulzSec, the Spanish guy, hacked the Cayman Islands,
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:08.240]  Val: right?
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:10.040]  Val: That was a great one, by the way, it's good stuff.
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.200]  Fed: What happened with Cayman?
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:13.520]  Fed: I just don't know about it.
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.800]  Val: Well, for me, it was on this, you don't know about it?
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:16.640]  Fed: It was here, right?
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:17.960]  Val: Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:18.960]  Fed: I missed it, I'm sorry.
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:19.800]  Val: Oh, it's great.
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.640]  Fed: That's definitely hacking news.
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:23.880]  Val: No, I guess this guy was on the service for like a year,
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:26.200]  Val: and it was just, I think he took all the Bitcoin,
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:27.480]  Val: like all of it.
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:29.880]  Val: And so he said, hey, anybody out there hack a bank,
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:32.400]  Val: I'm gonna give you $100,000 of Bitcoin.
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:33.240]  Val: So I'm like, you know what?
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:34.440]  Val: Hey, Emma, could you tell your friend,
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:36.480]  Val: I think I deserve at least a run-in
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:38.320]  Val: for this $100,000 in Bitcoin,
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:40.080]  Val: because although I did not hack Deutsche Bank,
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.040]  Val: that's why I'm trying to work.
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.480]  Val: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:43.840]  Val: And so Emma's like, no, you didn't,
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:44.920]  Val: you didn't hack Deutsche Bank,
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:47.720]  Val: but she didn't say, oh, let me pass on the message.
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:49.400]  Val: She didn't say, oh, hold on a second,
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:53.000]  Val: she just immediately responded as if she was the hacker.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.760]  Val: So I suspected that it's possible that she's the hacker.
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:58.800]  Val: I've always thought she was,
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:39:59.960]  Val: because I always ask her.
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:02.600]  Val: Like I'm incriminating myself,
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:04.320]  Val: but I'm constantly asking like, Emma,
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:05.560]  Val: can you figure out how to do this?
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:06.600]  Val: Can you hack this shit for me?
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:08.320]  Val: Because I can't get past this point, you know?
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:11.320]  Val: Like with the, for example, David Enrich,
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.640]  Val: we have so much more, oh, this would be something
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:19.560]  Val: maybe you could help me with.
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:22.120]  Val: So many efforts and incriminates him
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.520]  Val: with so many fucking terrible things that he's done
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:25.920]  Val:  and all the shit he's done for me.
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:27.560]  Val: It was all in signal.
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:30.120]  Val: And I took my phone to get the screen fix at the Apple Store
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:32.920]  Val: and I said, whatever you do, do not reset the phone.
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:35.680]  Val: And the fucking, the fucker has reset the phone.
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:36.760]  Val: And so I lost it all.
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:38.440]  Val: But I think it's an iPhone 6S,
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:40.240]  Val: so it's not irretrievable.
[02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:42.400]  Val: It's still on the fucking phone.
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.320]  Val: But I cannot get the keys.
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:45.600]  Val: I don't know how to get the fucking keys yet.
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:48.400]  Val: It's been the slowest thing I've ever learned.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.960]  Val: But I've got the tar ball, I've extracted the messages,
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:52.560]  Val: but I cannot get the fucking encryption keys
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.320]  Val: because I can't find them on the phone.
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:55.480]  Val: That's where I'm stuck.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:58.840]  Val: It's like, that was, well, Elcomsoft.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:01.960]  Val: iOS, Forensic edition.
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:06.960]  Val: iOS, Forensic, it's just toolkits.
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:11.200]  Val: iOS, Forensic, toolkits, it's a quick thing to do.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.520]  Fed: I mean, at least from my experience,
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:17.320]  Fed: Elcomsoft isn't like a great [???] with forensic utility.
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:20.440]  Fed: Like, I've played around with it, but I didn't use it because,
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:22.320]  Fed: like, they don't automatically decrypt stuff
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:25.400]  Fed: because, like, most normal forensics programs do.
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:26.240]  Val: Really?
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:27.560]  Val: All right.
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:29.720]  Fed: I'll talk to you about the free one.
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:30.560]  Fed: Autopsy?
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:31.400]  Val: Is it good?
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:32.240]  Fed: Autopsy's [???] not bad.
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:34.320]  Fed: I mean, that's a free one that anyone can download, isn't it?
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:35.560]  Fed: It's a bunch of other ones that, I think,
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:37.360]  Fed: a better job than Elcomsoft.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:38.360]  Val: Yeah.
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:40.400]  Val: I just, well, it's because I spent the money.
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:41.720]  Val: You know, it's having expenses,
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:43.440]  Val: so I feel like I have to learn it.
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:44.280]  Val: Yeah.
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:48.960]  Fed: I don't know.
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.920]  Fed: Another company that kind of delved into mobile,
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:51.760]  Fed: it does just my opinion.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:53.080]  Val: No, no, no, you're right.
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.280]  Val: They're really famous because of the thing with the photographs
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:41:58.480]  Val: in 2015, right?
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:00.440]  Fed: So, like, they're kind of, riding their coattails,
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:02.280]  Fed: now they have a mobile forensic thing that they're like,
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:03.760]  Fed: well, if we put this out and they trust our name,
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:04.600]  Fed: then they'll use it.
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:05.800]  Fed: But, just from my experience,
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:07.200]  Fed: I just haven't had much success with it.
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.560]  Val: Did you try Axiom?
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:09.400]  Fed: I used Axiom.
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:10.240]  Val: What do you think of that one?
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.080]  Fed: That's not bad.
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:12.000]  Fed: It's a lot of good functionality.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.520]  Val: Yeah, it's pretty strong.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:14.360]  Val: Yeah.
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:15.520]  Val: It's very good.
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:17.640]  Val: So then I figured out you can just get pre-trials,
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:21.840]  Val: if you just say you're extending the pre-trials.
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:24.680]  Val: But yeah.
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:29.680]  Val: So you think that Best is, she actually is a NSA, CIA?
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.560]  Val: No, I think she's full of shit, yeah.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:36.040]  Fed: But do you think that she's a hacker?
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:36.880]  Val: I do.
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.360]  Val: I personally, I do think so.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.320]  Val: I know no one else seems to share my opinion,
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.760]  Val: but I do think that she's a hacker.
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:46.520]  Val: I'm always trying to ask her to do it for some help,
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:50.240]  Val: but she's the one that introduced me to Elcomsoft.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:52.800]  Val: I said, I have this problem with the signal messages.
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:53.640]  Val: What do you recommend?
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.480]  Val: She said, Elcomsoft, ios, forensic.
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:02.040]  Fed: I don't know.
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:04.480]  Val: Again, again, right, it's too open-ended.
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:06.400]  Val: And she texted me the other day.
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:09.640]  Val: She's like, Val have you spoken to FBI,
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:11.880]  Val: I said, no, I'm not speaking to FBI.
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:14.040]  Val: She's like, well, are you sure?
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:15.280]  Val: I was like, well, I'm not lying to you.
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:17.880]  Val: I was talking to the FBI, like, you know,
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:20.360]  Val: I will let you know when I speak to FBI.
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:24.480]  Val: She said, well, you're kind of known as an FBI informant.
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:26.280]  Val: I said, well, fuck you, I'm not an informant.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:28.520]  Val: I'm a source, like, help the FBI.
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:30.680]  Val: I do not inform on anybody.
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:32.400]  Val: And then she's like, well, it's kind of the same thing.
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:33.640]  Val: And then I had to go on a tirade
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:35.520]  Val: to explain how it's very different.
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:38.640]  Val: So let you know that she is probably,
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:42.320]  Val: and also yesterday, one of my friends, Andrew,
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:44.280]  Val: had to defend me on this group as well,
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:47.480]  Val: because Xan was saying, you're friends
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:50.280]  Val: with a well-known FBI informant, which is me,
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:52.080]  Val: which is another allusion to me.
[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.240]  Fed: So it's Xan.
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:56.480]  Fed: Oh, Xan is telling you.
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:58.800]  Val: Xan's the partner of Emma.
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.720]  Fed: So she's saying to who?
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:03.600]  Val: a friend of mine in our group.
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:06.840]  Fed: Oh, so your friend is, Xan is attacking your friend
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:07.880]  Val: for being friends with you?
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:08.880]  Val: Yes.
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:09.380]  Fed: Oh, OK.
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:09.880]  Fed: Sorry.
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:12.360]  Fed: Exactly.
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:13.360]  Fed: OK.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.920]  Fed: I mean, it's obviously a little different,
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:18.080]  Fed: and I don't know if you understand.
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:19.080]  Val: This is weird drama.
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:23.080]  Fed: It's like, yeah, there are many people with a group like that.
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:25.560]  Val: I think this, you know, I'm like 96, I think.
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:26.800]  Fed: Oh, wow.
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:29.080]  Val: That's why it's too many people.
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:31.160]  Val: And there's too many lurkers, and there's too many new
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.960]  Val: and fresh, like, minted identity,
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:36.040]  Val: so there's already a bunch of substratas,
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:38.720]  Val: and subgroups are coming from that group.
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:42.240]  Val: And what's funny is they're all, well, I mean,
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:43.480]  Val: I'll tell you, it's not a big deal.
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.240]  Val: It's with all Barrett's friends.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:48.520]  Val: Barrett's so, like, it's so weird.
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:51.400]  Val: I don't know how he does it, but he's, you know.
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:54.760]  Fed: Because you might, of the 96, you might know how many people
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:56.680]  Fed: in real life are in that group.
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:58.440]  Val: Like, what do you mean in real life.
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:01.040]  Fed: Well, I guess, like, who they really are.
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:02.880]  Val: Oh, I know about half of them.
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:03.380]  Val: Yeah.
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:05.800]  Fed: Like, into the other half, or like, lurker or something.
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:10.480]  Val: Yeah, but we have people that try and check them out
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:12.840]  Val: and figure out who these people are.
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:14.560]  Val: Like, once in a while, you'll get it right,
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.880]  Val: and we can serve it, you know, coming in there
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:20.680]  Val: and trying to spout a bunch of crazy shit, and kick him out.
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:23.040]  Val: And then, I noticed, someone loses a phone.
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:24.720]  Val: Like, it happened recently, and then all of a sudden,
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.160]  Val: we have to, it's been compromised, the FBI's in.
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.880]  Val: I'm sure you, was that you?
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.520]  Fed: I don't know.
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:31.960]  Val: Was it you?
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:32.680]  Val: Okay, somebody.
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:33.680]  Fed: I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:35.560]  Val: It was somebody.
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:41.680]  Val: Oh, and that, oh, shit, wait, Agent Ko.
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:43.160]  Val: Did you call Barrett?
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:45.640]  Val: I think he recorded a phone call with you.
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:46.480]  Fed: I haven't called Barrett.
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:47.320]  Val: You haven't called Barrett?
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:52.560]  Val: There was a different FBI agent that was trying to,
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:57.240]  Val: he was going to, I think it was some white racist,
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:45:59.560]  Val: nationalist fucking weird shit.
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:02.280]  Fed: And he was someone else who was working, white racist.
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:05.160]  Val: Yeah, he used to know, but I remember the name
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:07.240]  of Ko actually rings a bell.
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:09.200]  Val: And I was, I was going to tell you the other day,
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.760]  Val: but I had to figure out what it was first.
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:12.240]  Val: But now I just remembered again, I probably
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:14.760]  Val: should not be talking right now and saying it out loud,
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:17.420]  Val: but I am.
[02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:23.080]  Val: But there is something, there is something,
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:24.880]  Val: something secret.
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:25.760]  Val: Secret is going to be right now.
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:26.640]  Fed: Okay?
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:28.840]  Fed: [???] in real life?
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:32.080]  Val: No.
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:32.880]  Fed: Does he know Barrett?
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:34.400]  Fed: Have you met him in person?
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:37.000]  Val: I know, I know, I've never met in person.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.360]  Val: Oh, well, I mean, I have met, yes,
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.320]  Val: there's a few people I know personally,
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:44.400]  Val: but I can't, like my friends, I'm not gonna tell you, yeah.
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:48.480]  Fed: Getting a sense of the group, like, any other.
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:50.760]  Val: Let me show you, like, the most recent thing.
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:53.440]  Val: Let's see.
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:01.440]  Val: Ooh, someone's trying to,
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:05.680]  Val: Hey, you guys, who's trying to hack me now?
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:06.520]  Fed: You got a thing?
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:07.360]  Fed: No.
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:08.320]  Fed: Don't click on the link.
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:09.920]  Fed: What was it? What did you get?
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:11.200]  Val: No, I just got one of these things.
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:12.880]  Val: I think it's my girlfriend.
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:15.120]  Val: Who's using the other computer?
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:16.160]  Fed: Oh, he's.
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.440]  Fed: No, that's not what that says.
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:18.280]  Val: That's my girlfriend.
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:19.880]  Fed: He's finding it really fucking awesome.
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:21.000]  Val: Yeah, I know.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.440]  Val: It's, like, it's funny enough, the other computer
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.520]  Val: is Glen Simpson's.
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:27.600]  Fed: What was that?
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:29.600]  Val: Yeah, it was the Fusion GCat.
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:31.800]  Val: The Steele Dossier.
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:36.320]  Fed: I mean, like, there's a lot of stuff
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:37.160]  Fed: that I probably should know,
[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:39.800]  Fed: but I just don't, I mean, it's kind of like.
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.320]  Val: You didn't follow the Steele Dossier?
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:42.320]  Val: The whole Trump Russia?
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:43.160]  Fed: No, I did know about it,
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:44.760]  Fed: but, like, I didn't follow that much.
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:46.800]  Val: Anyway, I said, I lived at his house for a while,
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:48.400]  Val: at Glen's house, yeah.
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:49.560]  Val: And he didn't pay me half the money
[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:51.560]  Val: he was supposed to, so I took the computer.
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:53.600]  Fed: Wait, is that, yeah.
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.800]  Val: Oh, and yeah, and there's a whole Russian spy thing
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:01.120]  Val: going on, too.
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:02.440]  Val: What's the Russian spy thing?
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.000]  Val: So there's, so I was telling Tim and Jami as well,
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.840]  Val: but they're sort of, they're thing, so I don't know.
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.360]  Val: Am I supposed to mix things together?
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.120]  Fed: But if Tim's aware of it, like, I would use the hot tin.
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:17.120]  Val: Let me tell Tim first.
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:17.960]  Val: Let me tell Tim first.
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:18.800]  Fed: Okay.
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:20.560]  Val: Well, I should ask him if it's okay
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.400]  Fed: Yeah, I mean, if Tim already knows about it,
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:25.960]  Fed: he would, like, I don't worry that type of stuff either,
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:28.160]  Fed: so, like, I would just tell someone else to.
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:31.160]  Val: Yeah, would he, would he tell me the, uh,
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:33.200]  Val: interior or the exterior?
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:35.160]  Val: Like, like, what, the United States
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:36.840]  Val: or outside of the United States?
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:39.160]  Val: Are we looking for a Russian hacker
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:41.560]  Val: or are we looking for a, everything?
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:42.400]  Val: Yeah?
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:44.640]  Val: Dude, that would be fun for me.
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:45.680]  Val: I would like to catch people.
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:47.840]  Val: I like, I can, I can do that.
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:49.840]  Val: But if money, the money is my specialty.
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:52.920]  Val: That's what I'm, better than the hacker.
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:57.520]  Fed: Cool.
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:58.360]  Fed: All right.
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.760]  Fed: Do you need to send someone for something?
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:02.000]  Val: Oh, yeah, sorry.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.600]  Val: No, I just got, I need to eat something.
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.440]  Val: My brain is...
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:06.720]  Fed: You don't think you're gonna eat something?
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.160]  Val: Yeah, could we take a cigarette break or something?
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:10.120]  Val: Is it okay?
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:10.960]  Fed: Yeah.
