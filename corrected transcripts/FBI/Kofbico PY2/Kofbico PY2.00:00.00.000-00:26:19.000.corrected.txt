[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Val: Right now. Good.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  Val: Okay. Yeah.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Val: Where are my phones?
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  Val: Uh-huh. Where am I?
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Val: Deployed.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Val: Deployed.
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Val: Oh, why don't you take these out for a second?
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  Val: One, two, three.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  Val: I don't think I like these jeans.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  Marie: They're really great.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  Val: Yeah, very.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  Marie: Yeah, especially when we run the run.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Val: Thank you, baby.
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  Val: You're kind of...
[00:43.000 --> 00:44.000]  Marie: Normal guy.
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  Val: Normal guy?
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  Val: Oh, good.
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.000]  Marie: Cool.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  Val: Cool style.
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.000]  Marie: Like, very stylish.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  Val: Nice.
[00:51.000 --> 00:52.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  Marie: I don't...
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  Val: I don't wear this stuff.
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.000]  Val: Okay.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  Marie: Huh?
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Val: Oh, my cigarette.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  Val: Oh, yeah, my check.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  Val: I need that mask.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  Marie: Okay.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  Val: And my cigarette loaves.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  Marie: What are you using now?
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  Val: Uh, lighter.
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  Val: Like a small one.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  Val: Oh, I think I have one in my bag, actually.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.000]  Val: Oh, perfect.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  Val: No, no, no. Wait, wait.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  Val:  This one scares me.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.000]  Val: No.
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.000]  Val: That's not good.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  Val: You can put that somewhere else.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  Val: One, two, three.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  Marie: Courage, huh?
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  Val: Do you want to give me back all the other stuff?
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.000]  Val: The, um...
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  Val: The bad greeners?
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  Val: Do you want that back?
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  Marie: Yeah, this one.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  Val: Okay.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.000]  ??: I can't do this one.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  Val: Okay.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  Val: Is it bad?
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[01:55.000 --> 01:56.000]  Val: Yeah.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.000]  I can't do this.
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  I don't know if it's...
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  It's good.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  It's good?
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  Yeah.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's beautiful.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  You...
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  Val: I'm gonna picture you in your beauty.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  Val: Okay.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  Val: Wow.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.000]  Val: Okay.
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  Val: That's all.
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  Val: That's all.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  Marie: Um...
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Val: Maybe you can meet me if you come downstairs now.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  Val: Why don't you go by the building?
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  Val: Come here.
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.000]  Val: Come here.
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.000]  Val: No, no, in front of the building.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  Val: Just get in there.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  Val: Just...
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  Val: Just get your best friend in the building, please.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  Val: Why are you both doing that with your top?
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  Val: That would be that, no.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Val: This is not France in 1992.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Val: Both shoulders off.
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000]  Val: That's better.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  Val: That's what I'm talking about.
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  Val: What?
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  Val: I'm telling you to come down and meet me.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  Val: See, he's supposed to come down and meet me.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Val: You have to sneak me in, remember?
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  Val: He's heading down now.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  Val: Okay.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  Val: So, I'll say Marie wants me...
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  ???: Do you do well?
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  ???: Do you need to do well?
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  Val: Yes, I do.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  Val: I'm saying you just want to briefly meet him and say hi.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  Val: Sure.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  Marie: Okay.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  Marie: Sure.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  Val: I'll miss you beaucoup.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  ???: You want me to put some of this on this guy?
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.000]  ???: Yeah.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Marie: He's covered in this.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  ???: Okay.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Val: I'm going to tell him we're outside in the parking lot.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Val: You said it's cool to meet him, you can meet him.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Val: We're outside in the parking lot.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  Val: Drop off your air. [sic]
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Marie: Yeah, too.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  Val: Drop off your air.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Val: Red Mini, you can't do this here.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.000]  Val: Where is it?
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  Marie: Here.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  Val: What's up?
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  Val: Okay.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  Val: Where is that?
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  Val: I'm worried.
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  Val: Aw, thank you.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.000]  Val: Perfect.
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  Val: Oh, yes.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Val: Good idea, baby.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.000]  Marie: What?
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.000]  Val: That's a good one.
[05:04.000 --> 05:05.000]  Val: I like the pie.
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.000]  Val: Nice.
[05:06.000 --> 05:07.000]  Marie: Okay.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  Marie: You're not switching too much.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  Val: I am so hot.
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  Val: There will be air con inside.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.000]  Val: My story.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  Marie: It's a cool thing because it's like an internet joint.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  Val: Yeah?
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  Marie: Look.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  Marie: Super elegant.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  Marie: You look super cool.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  Val: Super stylish.
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  Val: Super fashionable.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Val: I like it.
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.000]  Marie: I need you.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  Val: It's the best thing.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  Val: Not as bad as me.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  Val: Do you want one of these or do you have another one?
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  Val: Yes, good.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  Val: Well done.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  Val: Perfect.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Val: Good, good, good.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  Val: That's what I'm talking about.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  Val: Smart.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Val: See you again.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  Marie: Thank you so much.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  Marie: Thank you.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  Val: I'll give myself a bit.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  Val: Pipe.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  Val: That's what you can't use.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  Marie: You have a band on your arm.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000]  Val: Is it your boyfriend?
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Val: Is it your husband?
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  Val: Is it your boyfriend?
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  Marie: No, no, no.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.000]  Val: Is it your controlling boyfriend?
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.000]  Marie: They looked at me.
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.000]  Marie: They were like...
[06:04.000 --> 06:05.000]  Val: Who?
[06:05.000 --> 06:06.000]  Marie: Nothing.
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.000]  Val: What was the thing?
[06:07.000 --> 06:08.000]  Val: You have a band.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.000]  Marie: I just...
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  Marie: I did not know what it was to me.
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.000]  Val: Look, what did they...
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  Val: Is it like...
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  Marie: No, I was cooking and...
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.000]  Val: They mean anything about it?
[06:14.000 --> 06:15.000]  Marie: No, no.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  Marie: They just looked at me and looked at me and looked at me.
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.000]  Val: Okay.
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.000]  Val: Hello.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.000]  Val: How's my hair?
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  Marie: It's okay.
[06:24.000 --> 06:25.000]  Val: What's it?
[06:25.000 --> 06:26.000]  Val: It's okay.
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.000]  Val: Don't worry about it.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  Val: It just makes my hair look a little stupid.
[06:29.000 --> 06:30.000]  Val: It's okay.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  Val: It's weird.
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  Val: It's okay?
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  Marie: We need some sun.
[06:33.000 --> 06:34.000]  Val: I know.
[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000]  Val: We need some sunglasses.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  Marie: Oh my God, yeah.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  Val: Maybe we can do that today.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Val: Oh, can you make appointments at the Apple Store for us?
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  Val: Soon after your...
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  Val: Your thing, we can go directly to the Apple Store.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  Val: You get a new pair of glasses.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  Val: We can go directly to the Apple Store.
[06:49.000 --> 06:50.000]  Val: You get a new phone.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  Marie: So we're not being hacked by everybody.
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  Val: Yes, you do, because you're hacked by everybody.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  Val: Okay.
[06:57.000 --> 06:58.000]  Marie: No, but in your ear.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  Val: Oh, yeah?
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.000]  Val: Did you get them?
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Val: I don't...
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Marie: I'm sorry.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  Val: What are you doing?
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  Marie: No, but they're in there.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.000]  Val: Oh, okay.
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.000]  Marie: I know, it's annoying, but...
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  Val: Not helpful.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.000]  Val: It's really loud.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  Val: It's really, really super loud, baby.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  Val: I'm sorry.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Val: You just can't blow my ears like that.
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  Val: All right, so where are the plans today?
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  Val: Today's plans.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.000]  Val: Okay.
[07:25.000 --> 07:26.000]  Val: You're gonna do this.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  Val: See how long it goes.
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  Val: You might pick me up.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.000]  Val: You might not.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  Val: So I'll take Uber and then go to...
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  Val: Oh, shit.
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  Val: I left it inside.
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.000]  Val: Yeah, I need my keys.
[07:41.000 --> 07:42.000]  Val: Oh, there's the Fanta.
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  Val: The pineapple Fanta?
[07:43.000 --> 07:44.000]  Marie: Yeah.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  Val: Ah.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  Val: Wonderful.
[07:46.000 --> 07:47.000]  Val: Thank you.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  Val: Perfect.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  Val: One, two, three.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  Val: I got it.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  Marie: Do you have to go?
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.000]  Val: Yeah, well, he's gonna come.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  Val: All right?
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  Val: I told him Red Mini, you can't miss us.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.000]  Marie: Good night.
[08:03.000 --> 08:04.000]  Val: Yeah, just leave it here.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  Val: Yeah.
[08:05.000 --> 08:06.000]  Val: Put on the hazards.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.000]  Val: Put the hazards on.
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  Val: Nice.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  Val: Lock it, yeah.

[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  Val: It's going right now.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  Val: What about this back?
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.000]  Val: See the back?
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.000]  Val: It sticks out?

[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  Marie: I got it.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  Val: Oh, careful.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Val: Remember to shake on my back.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.000]  Val: Thank you.

[09:28.000 --> 09:29.000]  Val: Thanks.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  Val: How's it going?
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  Val: Good, good.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  Val: Boeing.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  Val: Is that your name, is that it?
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  Val: Like the...
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.000]  Val: Oh, where's my mask?
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  Val: Yeah.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  Val: The company, right?
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  Fed: Look at it.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  Val: Do your parents...
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  Fed: Is that the one staff that comes down?
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  Val: Oh, my God.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  Val: There was some, but not for LA.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  Fed: Okay.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  Val: Really weird.
[09:48.000 --> 09:49.000]  Val: So easy.
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.000]  Cool.
[09:50.000 --> 09:51.000]  Yeah.
[09:51.000 --> 09:52.000]  Fed: Yeah, it was part of our strategy.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.000]  Fed: Lightened up a little bit.
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  Val: Sorry I'm late, though.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  Fed: Oh, come on.
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.000]  Val: It's like LA.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  Val: You're from here.
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.000]  Val: It's...
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.000]  Val: You're not from here.
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.000]  Fed: No, no, no.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  Fed: Not me.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  Fed: Not from here.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  Fed: We're going to get you a visitor, guys.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  Fed: What?
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  Fed: Is there a visitor?
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  Fed: Come on in, sir.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  Val: I have a photo of it.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  Fed: I need a physical ID, unless you guys are okay with that.
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  Val: This is actually my fault because I lost my drivers license a few days ago.
[10:16.000 --> 10:17.000]  Val: I don't know where it is.
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  Val: It's in a book.
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.000]  Val: It's on my bookshelf.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  Fed: It's okay.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  Val: You guys are okay with that?
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  Fed: Okay.
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  Fed: Just go ahead and place all your items here in the bin for me.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  Fed: Okay, now do you want to let you know you were entering the federal facility?
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  Fed: Okay, we are conducting.
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  Fed: Sir, one second.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  Fed: Okay, listen to me.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  Fed: I'm not done with this inspection, okay?
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  Fed: We are inspecting for weapons and explosives.
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  Fed: You have nothing like that on you?
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.000]  Val: No, I don't.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  Fed: You can still carry any tools, knives, pepper spray, nothing like that?
[10:40.000 --> 10:41.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Fed: Let's do your belt off.
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.000]  Val: Oh, great.
[10:43.000 --> 10:44.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  Fed: I'm going to have you take off your coat.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  Val: Sure.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  Val: Sure.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  Val: No problem.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  You guys, what are you doing?
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  Fed: Do you have any electronics?
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  Val: Okay.
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  Val: No, they're all in here.
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.000]  Fed: Okay, put them separately, boss.
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  Fed: Separately from your bag.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  Fed: You can put them right here with your document.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  Fed: Put your document here.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  Fed: Put your document right there, okay?
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  Val: I'll leave them in the bag.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.000]  Val: You want to take them out of there?
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  Fed: Take them out of there.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  Val: I brought some stuff.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  Val: He said don't bring anything.
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.000]  Val: I thought you marked it.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.000]  Val: I thought you were just being polite.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  Val: I brought a little stuff for you.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  Fed: Okay.

[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  Val: Oh, wait.
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  Val: I don't mean anything.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  Fed: Yeah, everything out of your pocket.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  Fed: Okay?
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  Val: Okay.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  Fed: So you have nothing with your name on it?
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  Val: I do.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  Fed: Okay.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  Val: But I'll show it to you on my phone.

[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  Val: And I think she – uh, Chinese.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  Fed: I apologize, I think because of like pandemic stuff, usually they're coming here.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  Val: Oh, oh really? In the break room upstairs to the floor?
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  Fed: Yeah, you know what there is.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  Val: Oh, perfect, okay.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  Fed: Good morning gentlemen.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Fed: Good morning. We have a visitor here, and he's from...
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000]  Fed: Thank you.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  Fed: Cheers.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  Fed: Can you see my partner?
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  Val: Thanks.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Val: You guys want to do this again?
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Val: Oh, okay.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  Val: Thank you.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  Fed: Thank you.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  Val: Cool.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  Val: Does everyone make fun?
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  Fed: Um...
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  Val: Really, huh?
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  Fed: Yeah, usually you'll feel comfortable here because of your game console.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  Val: Oh, dang it.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  Fed: You know, I get to meet about a fun man or two different people.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  Val: I remember this tenth floor.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Val: I handed my stuff, we go to another one over there.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Fed: Exactly, same thing.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  Fed: And then what we just handled over there used to be handled on the tenth floor.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  Val: Yeah.
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  Val: So that girl's no longer working here?
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  Val: It's a floor lady?
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  Fed: Oh, it's always changing.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  Val: She's so nice.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  Val: Super nice.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  Fed: Oh, that could be it.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  Val: Yeah.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  Val: Still not.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  Val: Are you guys there?
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  Val: So, some of you are special agents?
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  Fed: Yep.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  Val: And you are DC3?
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  Fed: Uh, I'm not...
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  Fed: I'm not in LA
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  Fed: You know, I'm not part of their...
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  Fed: Their hierarchy.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  Fed: No, I'm not.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  Val: It's not the...
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  Val: It's the general hierarchy.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  Val: In New York.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  Val: It's everything but Russia.
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  Fed: DC3.
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  Fed: Yeah, so it usually doesn't work in the same way.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  Val: Oh.
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Fed: So different...
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  Fed: Different to a lot of different things.
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.000]  Val: Cool.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  Val: Oh, there.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.000]  Val: I see what you're saying.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.000]  Fed: You remember that?
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  Val: I do.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  Val: Oh, wait.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  Val: It's my natural that's supposed to...
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  Fed: Oh, right.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  Val: Thanks.
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  Val: Okay.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  What's going to do with it?
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  Fed: I wonder if we're all thoroughly...
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Fed: What's going on?
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  Val: Did you get a chance to...
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  Val: There were four lights.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  Val: Clever.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  Val: I liked it.
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.000]  Val: I liked it.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  Fed: I'd love you get the reference.
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  Val: Oh, I got it.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.000]  Val: I got it.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  Fed: That's what it is.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  Fed: That's supposed to make a random number.
[17:03.000 --> 17:04.000]  Val: Yeah, that's good.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  Fed: One, two, three, four, five, six, whatever.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  Val: I was surprised you spelled out four, though.
[17:08.000 --> 17:09.000]  Fed: Oh, I think...
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  Fed: Because I never thought we'd take anything.
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  Val: Oh, it was?
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  Val: Oh, okay.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  Fed: Yeah, that's how it is.
[17:14.000 --> 17:15.000]  Val: It's good.
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  Val: Well, you read the call of Winston.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  Val: It's from Winston.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  Val: And he's being tortured.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.000]  Fed: Right.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  Val: Writing in the floor.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  Val: It's a portless floor.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  Val: A two-plus-two-plus-four.
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.000]  Fed: Interesting.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  Fed: No.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Fed: That's the one where there are five lights.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  Fed: And he makes Picard saying that there are four.
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.000]  Val: Oh, no.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  Fed: He makes them say that there are five lights.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  Val: I know, but that's...
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  Val: But it's taken from 1984?
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  Fed: Yes.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  Right after the record.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Right after the record.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  Val: Nice.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  Val: Cool.
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  Fed: He probably grabbed all the stuff.
[17:59.000 --> 18:00.000]  Fed: Okay.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  Fed: Is there another room?
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  Val: I think I might have a bigger...
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  Fed: No, it's okay.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  I like the other side of the room.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  Sorry, this side.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  That's a big one.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  It's gonna be good.
[18:14.000 --> 18:15.000]  Hang on there.
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.000]  Val: I don't...
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  Val: Cool.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  Fed: Well, this is...
[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  Fed: This is Patty
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  Val: Patty?
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  Val: How do you do it?
[18:38.000 --> 18:39.000]  Val: Nice to meet you.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  Fed: Can I take a hand?
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.000]  Fed: Yeah, I know, it's a...
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  Val: The virtual way, right?
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  Fed: Sure, sure.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  Val: Patty, are you from Houston as well?
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  Fed: No.
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.000]  Val: LA?
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  Val: From LA.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  Val: Okay.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  Fed: How do you like your coffee?
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  Val: Lots of milk sugar.
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.000]  Fed: Milk sugar?
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  Val: Yes, please.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  Val: Can I take off my mask?
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  Fed: Good.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  Val: We casual here?
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  Fed: Okay.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  Fed: I have one.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  Fed: Take it really.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  Val: I just can't get the frogs up my glasses.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  Val: You do it with your fogger.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  Fed: I know.
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  Val: You know?
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  Fed: I've got some people with a mask.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.000]  Fed: I've got a clear one.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  Fed: Yeah, like a face shield.
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.000]  Fed: Yeah.
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  Fed: But now they're saying,
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.000]  oh, are you in the mask?
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  Right, right.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  It's very, really.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Val: Do you need both of them?
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Fed: I don't know.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  There are some.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  There are some.
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  Yeah, that's a lot.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  I can't wait for the last time.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  I'm just gonna leave this.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  Val: Believe it or not,
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  Val: Russia just did the other vaccine yesterday.
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  Fed: Of course they did.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  Fed: I saw that.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  Fed: I saw that too, right?
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  Val: It's propaganda.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  Val: It's propaganda.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  Fed: Oh, I'm sure.
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  Fed: I saw that too.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  Fed: Thank you.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  Val: Good to [unintelligible]
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  Val: So I'm so excited to hear what this is about.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  Fed: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  Val: I don't think I can take it anymore.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  Val: It's like so thrilling.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  Val: I've got four guesses.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  Val: Can I guess?
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  Fed: Sure, you can guess it.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  Val: Okay.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  Val: Does it have to do...
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  Val: I don't think it has to do with things.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  Fed: It [unintelligible] have to tell you.
[20:01.000 --> 20:02.000]  Fed: If that makes you feel any better.
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.000]  Val: That's not helpful.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  Val: All right, let me see if I can read you.
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  Val: Based on my guesses.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  Val: I don't think it's related to banking.
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.000]  Val: Okay.
[20:12.000 --> 20:13.000]  Val: I think it's related to hacking.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  Val: I think it has something to do with Emma.
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.000]  Fed: Okay.
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  Val: How am I?
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  Val: I'm close?
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  Val: I couldn't read you.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  Val: Well, no, you're getting a different one the first time.
[20:24.000 --> 20:25.000]  Val: Your eyes went to the right.
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.000]  Val: Usually, eyes up to the right,
[20:27.000 --> 20:28.000]  Val: you're creating something.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Val: Down to the left, it acts as a memory.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  Fed: So, everything I've read and studied about that
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  Fed: is actually bullshit.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  Val: It is bullshit.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  Val: You've got to know the person who does that.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  Val: It is true.
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  Val: You've got to get a baseline with the person first.
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Fed: Whatever.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  Val: It's not like global.
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.000]  Fed: Because you think about it,
[20:41.000 --> 20:42.000]  Fed: if that was true.
[20:42.000 --> 20:43.000]  Val: Yeah.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  Fed: Every poker tournament
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  Fed: you'd be able to find out immediately
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.000]  Fed: who's blocking the business.
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.000]  Val: That's true.
[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  Val: That's true.
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.000]  Fed: Because detection of deception
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  Fed: is incredibly difficult, unfortunately.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  Val: Well, do you think so?
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.000]  Val: I think it's pretty easy.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Fed: It's a research issue.
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  Val: If you know how you are deceptive,
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  Val: then you will know how someone else is deceptive.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  Val: Except for certain type.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  Fed: I would have to see.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  ???: Lisa?
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  Fed: So, there's different types of liars, too.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  Fed: There's Machiavellian liars,
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  Fed: who will lie just a lot.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  Fed: They'll lie because that's just what they did
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  Fed: every single day of their life.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  Val: Trump.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  Fed: Then, on the other side of the world,
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  Fed: there's what you can call the Catholic school
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  Fed: boy or girl.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  Fed: They've grown up with a fear of lying,
[21:22.000 --> 21:23.000]  Fed: where anytime they lie,
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  Fed: they're like,
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  Fed: I just said that my name is David.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  Fed: What does he think my name is?
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.000]  Val: The shame associated with guilt.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  Fed: So, those are, yeah, exactly.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  Fed: So, those are two very distinctly different types of liars
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  Fed: who lie very distinctly different.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  Fed: So, for example, the Machiavellian liars
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  Fed: is harder to detect on the line.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  Val: Because it's constant lines.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  Val: There's no baseline.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  Fed: And the opposite would be the Catholic school boy or girl
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  Fed: is harder to detect because they're constantly triggering.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  Fed: Well, they honestly think that they're lying about something
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  Fed: even when they're not.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  Val: What about the sort of desperate liars
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  Val: that are trying to stay alive?
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  Fed: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  Fed: That's what it means.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  Fed: I've read a couple books on it,
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  Fed: and we've taken a couple classes.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  Val: Yeah, that's what I was curious about in your classes.
[22:02.000 --> 22:03.000]  Val: Do they teach that?
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Val: Do they teach at Quantico or something?
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Fed: Like, that's a thing that I'm sure
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  Fed: can be used to see someone's life
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  Fed: and there are things that we'll do.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  Fed: And there's things that I do
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Fed: as part of my normal daily life.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  Val: Yeah.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  Val: Well, what I do is I ask you questions.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  I know. I'll ask you what's your name
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.000]  Val: when it's your birthday,
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  Val: because they're at low.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Val: And then I'll see how you react to the honest question.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  Val: And then I'll ask you something I know you don't know,
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  Val: and I'll see how you react to that.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  Val: And that's how I establish a baseline.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.000]  Val: That's my method, though.
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.000]  Fed: That's a good thing.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  Val: That's how I do it.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.000]  Val: What about you?
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  Fed: You had polygraph, huh?
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Val: What's a polygraph?
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  Val: No, no, I'm not.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  Val: I'm not.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  Val: I'm never taking polygraph.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  Val: I would like to if you guys [hook me up]
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  Val: It'd be fun.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  Val: But no, I just, you know,
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  Val: I like people.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  Val: Well, actually, I hate people, but I like...
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  Val: I love and I hate people,
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.000]  Val: but I like to study things.
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.000]  Val: I don't know.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  Fed: Very cool.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Fed: Very cool.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  Fed: That was nice of you,
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  Fed:we're going to bring you down here.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  Yeah.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  [unintelligible]
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Fed: if you want to head back out or something.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  Val: I'm sorry?
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  Fed: Do you have to give her a call?
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  Val: No, it's just got to work at one.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  Val: So she said,
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  Val: is you going to go out
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  Val: and just to write this letter
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  Val: to the judge?
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  Val: Yeah.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  Val: Well, he got screwed over by his fucking lawyer.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  Val: It's got to be Mike Kretzmer.
[23:13.000 --> 23:14.000]  Fed: Mm-hmm.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  Val: He went so far as to...
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  Val: He emailed Jim and Tammy
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  Val: saying,
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  Val: I am Val's counsel.
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.000]  Val: I am Val's attorney.
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  Fed: Interesting.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  Fed: Yeah, because I saw your text this morning.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  Val: I saw that.
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  Fed: You know, he said he'd like to represent you,
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  Fed: but he's not, so...
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  Val: Yeah, we had to fire him.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  Val: Yeah.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  Val: He was very condescending.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  Val: And there's something really wrong.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Val: You see, I thought it was in L.A.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  Val: I mean, it's like a mafia.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  Val: They know each other
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  Val: and they do whatever
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  Val: the other person says.
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  Val: It's very disturbing.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  Val: They don't want to mess it up however you want,
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  Val: but you have to have it.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  Val: That's perfect.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  Val: Thank you.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  Val: Wonderful.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.000]  All Val: right.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  Val: Well, I tried to guess what this is all about.
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  Val: It's
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  Val: nothing to do with banking.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  Fed: Okay.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  Val: And I think that's something to do with hacking.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  Val: And her name is Emma.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  Fed: Oh, look.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  Fed: I think I got the honor of being here.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  Fed: Well, I mean, to the third guess.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  Okay.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  No, no, no.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  Fed: Another guest.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  Interesting.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  Fed: Who's the third guest?
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  Fed: I thought you said he had four guesses.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  Val: No, no, no.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Okay.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  Yes.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  Oh, there's a guest.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  Val: It's a match.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  Val: It's a match.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  Val: It's a problem.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  Fed: Cool.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Fed: I guess, so,
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  Fed: what we're here for is mainly to see
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.000]  Fed: how we can help you, right?
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  Fed: Because we need to find out.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  Fed: So, you and I have talked,
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Fed: I've talked with Patty and Bowling
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  Fed: about it lately,
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  Fed: but you should probably
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  Fed: rehash a little bit about
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Fed: what the situation is right now,
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  Fed: how the hearing went,
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.000]  Fed: and everything else.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  Fed: Just make sure that we're all on the same page.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Fed: Because like I told you,
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  Fed: like, if we are going to be able to help,
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  Fed: we have to know how we can help
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  Fed: and how best to help you.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  Val: Okay.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  Fed: That way, we can go forward.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  Fed: But at the same time,
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  Fed: if you're going to help us,
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  Fed: you also have to know,
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  Fed: okay, well, is this going to be
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  Fed: dependent on something else?
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  Val: Right.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.000]  Val: Well, that's why,
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  Val: why don't you just tell me
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  Val: first what you want.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  Val: And then I'll go from there.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Fed: Well, I mean,
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  Fed: the thing is like,
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  Fed: I'm not going to tell you
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  Fed: what exactly we want.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  Fed: I'm telling you that right now.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  Val: I've already told you,
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.000]  Val: on the phone,
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  Val: I'm giving you my word,
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  Val: because you, Tim and Jami,
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  Val: recommended you.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  Val: I said,
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  Val: I'll help you if you need my help.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  Val: No matter what.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  Val: Even if it's,
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  Val: even if it's not anything related
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  Val: to you helping me,
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  Val: I will help you the best
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  Val: in my ability.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.000]  Val: Okay.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  Val: Just because of Tim and Jami,
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  Val: because I take,
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  Val: their word is very,
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  Val: they carry a lot with me.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  Val: It goes far with me.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  Val: So I've already told you that,
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.000]  Val: so I'll stick with that.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  Val: You don't have to worry about
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  Val: anything too transactional with me
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.000]  Val: right now.
[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  Val: Okay.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  Val: If you guys are coming out here
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.000]  Val: to help me,
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  Val: that's great.
[25:41.000 --> 25:42.000]  Fed: Okay.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.000]  Val: I'll tell you,
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  Val: what do you need to know?
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  Val: The whole story from the beginning?
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  Fed: Yep.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000] Fed: [unintelligible]
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  Okay.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  Go.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  Um.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  Um.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  Val: I don't even know where to start
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  Fed: from the beginning.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  Uh.
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.000]  Okay.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  Val: So,
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  Val: you don't know my story though.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  It Val: doesn't really matter, does it?
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.000]  Um.
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  Val: You can't even trust it.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  Val: You can't even trust it.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  Val: Oh, please don't read it.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  Val: David Enrich's article.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  Val: It's terrible.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  Val: Um.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  Val: Okay.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  Val: Marie and I met,
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  Val: uh,
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  Val: because I thought she was a spy for my mom,
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  Val: and I thought she was spying on me.
