[04:03:20.460 --> 04:03:22.460]  Val: Oh, there's a couple lawyers.
[04:03:22.460 --> 04:03:23.460]  Okay.
[04:03:23.460 --> 04:03:24.460]  So I get...
[04:03:24.460 --> 04:03:25.460]  There's people that call...
[04:03:25.460 --> 04:03:27.460]  they claim to be lawyers.
[04:03:27.460 --> 04:03:28.460]  Okay.
[04:03:28.460 --> 04:03:30.460]  And they ask me to do a bunch of stuff.
[04:03:30.460 --> 04:03:32.460]  First they'll have to do very strange data
[04:03:32.460 --> 04:03:34.460]  and then they say they're fighting and doing a lawsuit
[04:03:34.460 --> 04:03:36.460]  against like Iran or something like that
[04:03:36.460 --> 04:03:39.460]  on behalf of the veterans.
[04:03:39.460 --> 04:03:41.460]  They have to go collect data for them.
[04:03:41.460 --> 04:03:43.460]  And it's mostly just...
[04:03:43.460 --> 04:03:45.460]  I don't know why they're asking.
[04:03:45.460 --> 04:03:47.460]  I thought it was some spy.
[04:03:47.460 --> 04:03:49.460]  Oh, like you think they were asking...
[04:03:49.460 --> 04:03:51.460]  when they collect data,
[04:03:51.460 --> 04:03:53.460]  you think it was one of the most...
[04:03:53.460 --> 04:03:54.460]  Yeah.
[04:03:54.460 --> 04:03:56.460]  They're asking you to have it.
[04:03:56.460 --> 04:03:59.460]  And I know these two guys out of DC...
[04:03:59.460 --> 04:04:01.460]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[04:04:01.460 --> 04:04:02.460]  They...
[04:04:02.460 --> 04:04:03.460]  I told them to go fuck off,
[04:04:03.460 --> 04:04:04.460]  but they did fly out here.
[04:04:04.460 --> 04:04:05.460]  Yeah.
[04:04:05.460 --> 04:04:07.460]  I mean, they had their e-mail accounts.
[04:04:07.460 --> 04:04:08.460]  Yeah, no.
[04:04:08.460 --> 04:04:10.460]  Iran, do you mind if I do that for you?
[04:04:10.460 --> 04:04:11.460]  Sure.
[04:04:11.460 --> 04:04:12.460]  Because they're...
[04:04:12.460 --> 04:04:13.460]  there's something about them that's very off.
[04:04:13.460 --> 04:04:15.460]  They flew all the way out here from DC
[04:04:15.460 --> 04:04:18.460]  and then there was a very weird fucking...
[04:04:18.460 --> 04:04:19.460]  there was a weird experience
[04:04:19.460 --> 04:04:20.460]  what happened after that.
[04:04:20.460 --> 04:04:21.460]  Oh, I thought it was true.
[04:04:21.460 --> 04:04:22.460]  Yeah.
[04:04:22.460 --> 04:04:25.460]  You did this to hack into Iran?
[04:04:25.460 --> 04:04:28.460]  No, no, they wanted...
[04:04:28.460 --> 04:04:30.460]  wire information about money being sent
[04:04:30.460 --> 04:04:33.460]  from anywhere, any bank to Iran
[04:04:33.460 --> 04:04:36.460]  during 2009.
[04:04:36.460 --> 04:04:38.460]  It was just during the Gulf War, please.
[04:04:38.460 --> 04:04:39.460]  Okay.
[04:04:39.460 --> 04:04:42.460]  Well, it actually included Iran in 2010 as well.
[04:04:42.460 --> 04:04:43.460]  Okay.
[04:04:43.460 --> 04:04:44.460]  I'll...
[04:04:44.460 --> 04:04:46.460]  I'll e-mail you and do one.
[04:04:46.460 --> 04:04:47.460]  But, um...
[04:04:47.460 --> 04:04:49.460]  So the plan right now is...
[04:04:49.460 --> 04:04:50.460]  I know a Russian guy.
[04:04:50.460 --> 04:04:52.460]  He works through it, let's say.
[04:04:52.460 --> 04:04:53.460]  That must be...
[04:04:53.460 --> 04:04:54.460]  Yeah.
[04:04:54.460 --> 04:04:55.460]  Or he used to work for us.
[04:04:55.460 --> 04:04:56.460]  Okay.
[04:04:56.460 --> 04:04:58.460]  And he really wants to be an American.
[04:04:58.460 --> 04:05:00.460]  So he can be of very...
[04:05:00.460 --> 04:05:02.460]  very useful guy to you.
[04:05:02.460 --> 04:05:03.460]  What do you think?
[04:05:03.460 --> 04:05:04.460]  Me too.
[04:05:04.460 --> 04:05:05.460]  Me too?
[04:05:05.460 --> 04:05:06.460]  Yeah.
[04:05:06.460 --> 04:05:08.460]  But be careful, because, like, you know,
[04:05:08.460 --> 04:05:09.460]  he's being monitored.
[04:05:09.460 --> 04:05:10.460]  Mm-hmm.
[04:05:10.460 --> 04:05:11.460]  So, uh...
[04:05:11.460 --> 04:05:13.460]  you know, a person died.
[04:05:13.460 --> 04:05:14.460]  I did not want to...
[04:05:14.460 --> 04:05:15.460]  he was a good guy.
[04:05:15.460 --> 04:05:16.460]  He was a good guy.
[04:05:16.460 --> 04:05:17.460]  Or is he good?
[04:05:17.460 --> 04:05:18.460]  Yeah.
[04:05:18.460 --> 04:05:19.460]  He's traveling all over the world.
[04:05:19.460 --> 04:05:20.460]  He doesn't have to go back to Russia.
[04:05:20.460 --> 04:05:21.460]  He keeps being...
[04:05:21.460 --> 04:05:22.460]  getting...
[04:05:22.460 --> 04:05:23.460]  He's accepted.
[04:05:23.460 --> 04:05:25.460]  So he doesn't have to go back.
[04:05:25.460 --> 04:05:27.460]  And he keeps trying to, you know,
[04:05:27.460 --> 04:05:29.460]  ask me all, like,
[04:05:29.460 --> 04:05:31.460]  is there a way or a business?
[04:05:31.460 --> 04:05:32.460]  Can you introduce me to someone?
[04:05:32.460 --> 04:05:33.460]  So, like, Bali...
[04:05:33.460 --> 04:05:35.460]  He's a really good coder.
[04:05:35.460 --> 04:05:36.460]  I don't know.
[04:05:36.460 --> 04:05:37.460]  He's a good kind of guy.
[04:05:37.460 --> 04:05:38.460]  But, yeah.
[04:05:38.460 --> 04:05:39.460]  Uh, that would be very helpful for you,
[04:05:39.460 --> 04:05:40.460]  because he does know a lot.
[04:05:40.460 --> 04:05:41.460]  Well, how do you...
[04:05:41.460 --> 04:05:42.460]  How do you know me?
[04:05:42.460 --> 04:05:43.460]  I'm just gonna...
[04:05:43.460 --> 04:05:44.460]  Uh-huh, traveling.
[04:05:44.460 --> 04:05:45.460]  Yeah.
[04:05:45.460 --> 04:05:46.460]  Yeah.
[04:05:46.460 --> 04:05:47.460]  He's a girlfriend.
[04:05:47.460 --> 04:05:48.460]  A girlfriend is the daughter
[04:05:48.460 --> 04:05:50.460]  of a military general.
[04:05:50.460 --> 04:05:51.460]  That's why.
[04:05:51.460 --> 04:05:52.460]  Very interesting.
[04:05:52.460 --> 04:05:54.460]  Um, I think he was the...
[04:05:54.460 --> 04:05:55.460]  he was a...
[04:05:55.460 --> 04:05:58.460]  he was tired of making military journals.
[04:05:58.460 --> 04:05:59.460]  He came to...
[04:05:59.460 --> 04:06:01.460]  We don't have this position in America,
[04:06:01.460 --> 04:06:02.460]  but it's like a...
[04:06:02.460 --> 04:06:04.460]  a nice speaker at the house.
[04:06:04.460 --> 04:06:05.460]  It's like a...
[04:06:05.460 --> 04:06:07.460]  It's not a attorney general,
[04:06:07.460 --> 04:06:10.460]  but somewhere along the lines of a attorney general.
[04:06:10.460 --> 04:06:12.460]  Um, he's got...
[04:06:12.460 --> 04:06:13.460]  Yeah.
[04:06:13.460 --> 04:06:15.460]  That would be a very interesting theme.
[04:06:15.460 --> 04:06:16.460]  Yeah.
[04:06:16.460 --> 04:06:17.460]  I mean, and like I said,
[04:06:17.460 --> 04:06:18.460]  a lot of these things,
[04:06:18.460 --> 04:06:19.460]  I won't work.
[04:06:19.460 --> 04:06:20.460]  So, like, well,
[04:06:20.460 --> 04:06:21.460]  there's, I'll take the information,
[04:06:21.460 --> 04:06:22.460]  I'll give it to someone else,
[04:06:22.460 --> 04:06:23.460]  and see if they want to pursue it,
[04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:24.460]  and they'll probably talk to yours
[04:06:24.460 --> 04:06:25.460]  and the like that.
[04:06:25.460 --> 04:06:26.460]  Okay.
[04:06:26.460 --> 04:06:27.460]  Okay.
[04:06:27.460 --> 04:06:28.460]  Anyway, that's all good stuff.
[04:06:28.460 --> 04:06:30.460]  Um, I'd like to do...
[04:06:30.460 --> 04:06:31.460]  You can install my number
[04:06:31.460 --> 04:06:32.460]  so you can always, you know,
[04:06:32.460 --> 04:06:33.460]  reach out to me
[04:06:33.460 --> 04:06:34.460]  if you forget something or...
[04:06:34.460 --> 04:06:35.460]  Sure.
[04:06:35.460 --> 04:06:36.460]  You know, think of something later.
[04:06:36.460 --> 04:06:37.460]  Um...
[04:06:37.460 --> 04:06:38.460]  Where does Marla go?
[04:06:38.460 --> 04:06:39.460]  Yeah.
[04:06:39.460 --> 04:06:40.460]  So, as far as Marla goes,
[04:06:40.460 --> 04:06:41.460]  like I said, I think
[04:06:41.460 --> 04:06:43.460]  our primary goal will still be to
[04:06:43.460 --> 04:06:44.460]  make sure you look good
[04:06:44.460 --> 04:06:45.460]  for the investigation.
[04:06:45.460 --> 04:06:46.460]  Right?
[04:06:46.460 --> 04:06:47.460]  Um...
[04:06:47.460 --> 04:06:48.460]  But I can look good.
[04:06:48.460 --> 04:06:49.460]  I don't know what you mean.
[04:06:49.460 --> 04:06:50.460]  Like, just make sure
[04:06:50.460 --> 04:06:51.460]  that the investigator sees
[04:06:51.460 --> 04:06:52.460]  everything that he or she
[04:06:52.460 --> 04:06:53.460]  is supposed to see,
[04:06:53.460 --> 04:06:55.460]  as far as making you
[04:06:55.460 --> 04:06:56.460]  and Marla, you know,
[04:06:56.460 --> 04:06:57.460]  good parents,
[04:06:57.460 --> 04:06:58.460]  and super, uh,
[04:06:58.460 --> 04:06:59.460]  an adult.
[04:06:59.460 --> 04:07:00.460]  But my worry, though,
[04:07:00.460 --> 04:07:01.460]  is that it's already
[04:07:01.460 --> 04:07:02.460]  it's back again
[04:07:02.460 --> 04:07:03.460]  just purposely.
[04:07:03.460 --> 04:07:04.460]  I don't know why.
[04:07:04.460 --> 04:07:05.460]  Again, I just feel like
[04:07:05.460 --> 04:07:06.460]  you did it,
[04:07:06.460 --> 04:07:07.460]  and take the time in it.
[04:07:07.460 --> 04:07:09.460]  Um, so even if we do show
[04:07:09.460 --> 04:07:10.460]  our best stage
[04:07:10.460 --> 04:07:11.460]  and we're the most perfect people
[04:07:11.460 --> 04:07:12.460]  in the world,
[04:07:12.460 --> 04:07:13.460]  you'll see it.
[04:07:13.460 --> 04:07:14.460]  When you read the report,
[04:07:14.460 --> 04:07:15.460]  you'll see what they did.
[04:07:15.460 --> 04:07:18.460]  And now it can be...
[04:07:18.460 --> 04:07:19.460]  I don't know how to fight that,
[04:07:19.460 --> 04:07:20.460]  but it's something I don't know.
[04:07:20.460 --> 04:07:22.460]  It's tough not to crack, too,
[04:07:22.460 --> 04:07:23.460]  because, like I said,
[04:07:23.460 --> 04:07:24.460]  I mean,
[04:07:24.460 --> 04:07:26.460]  what would you suggest
[04:07:26.460 --> 04:07:27.460]  that we do to influence
[04:07:27.460 --> 04:07:29.460]  what's already been written
[04:07:29.460 --> 04:07:30.460]  or how the proceedings
[04:07:30.460 --> 04:07:32.460]  will go on from here?
[04:07:32.460 --> 04:07:34.460]  Well, I had, you know,
[04:07:34.460 --> 04:07:35.460]  my advantage,
[04:07:35.460 --> 04:07:36.460]  uh,
[04:07:36.460 --> 04:07:37.460]  fucking thing dismissed
[04:07:37.460 --> 04:07:39.460]  based on their terrible, uh,
[04:07:39.460 --> 04:07:40.460]  obviously,
[04:07:40.460 --> 04:07:41.460]  no deep process
[04:07:41.460 --> 04:07:42.460]  and misjudgment.
[04:07:42.460 --> 04:07:43.460]  I wrote down a list
[04:07:43.460 --> 04:07:44.460]  for reaction.
[04:07:44.460 --> 04:07:45.460]  Um,
[04:07:45.460 --> 04:07:46.460]  the lies
[04:07:46.460 --> 04:07:47.460]  are caught in camera.
[04:07:47.460 --> 04:07:48.460]  Right.
[04:07:48.460 --> 04:07:49.460]  Versus what they wrote
[04:07:49.460 --> 04:07:50.460]  in the report.
[04:07:50.460 --> 04:07:51.460]  And it'll be good
[04:07:51.460 --> 04:07:52.460]  if you can collect all the evidence
[04:07:52.460 --> 04:07:53.460]  so that you can show that
[04:07:53.460 --> 04:07:54.460]  to the judge or whomever.
[04:07:54.460 --> 04:07:55.460]  Like,
[04:07:55.460 --> 04:07:56.460]  I assume you're going to fire...
[04:07:56.460 --> 04:07:57.460]  You fired your attorney
[04:07:57.460 --> 04:07:58.460]  to hire a new one.
[04:07:58.460 --> 04:07:59.460]  Like,
[04:07:59.460 --> 04:08:00.460]  you know,
[04:08:00.460 --> 04:08:01.460]  because it's probably good
[04:08:01.460 --> 04:08:02.460]  to get an attorney.
[04:08:02.460 --> 04:08:03.460]  Because that was another thing
[04:08:03.460 --> 04:08:04.460]  I wanted to gauge
[04:08:04.460 --> 04:08:05.460]  what you could do
[04:08:05.460 --> 04:08:06.460]  and do we need an attorney
[04:08:06.460 --> 04:08:07.460]  based on what you could do?
[04:08:07.460 --> 04:08:08.460]  I mean,
[04:08:08.460 --> 04:08:09.460]  just my personal thing,
[04:08:09.460 --> 04:08:10.460]  I would probably want an attorney
[04:08:10.460 --> 04:08:11.460]  based on what I was in your situation.
[04:08:11.460 --> 04:08:12.460]  And I just, you know,
[04:08:12.460 --> 04:08:13.460]  this is why people make money
[04:08:13.460 --> 04:08:14.460]  and you can see it in color.
[04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:15.460]  Right.
[04:08:15.460 --> 04:08:16.460]  And like,
[04:08:16.460 --> 04:08:17.460]  yeah,
[04:08:17.460 --> 04:08:18.460]  and if this is completely not
[04:08:18.460 --> 04:08:19.460]  F.D.I.
[04:08:19.460 --> 04:08:20.460]  but just having friends
[04:08:20.460 --> 04:08:21.460]  that have gone through the work
[04:08:21.460 --> 04:08:22.460]  that you want to have a lawyer.
[04:08:22.460 --> 04:08:23.460]  Yeah.
[04:08:23.460 --> 04:08:24.460]  I mean,
[04:08:24.460 --> 04:08:25.460]  you know,
[04:08:25.460 --> 04:08:26.460]  where you can have a lawyer
[04:08:26.460 --> 04:08:27.460]  and an attorney.
[04:08:27.460 --> 04:08:28.460]  You can retell me that
[04:08:28.460 --> 04:08:29.460]  if you want me to be your lawyer.
[04:08:29.460 --> 04:08:30.460]  I swear to God,
[04:08:30.460 --> 04:08:31.460]  you said that.
[04:08:31.460 --> 04:08:32.460]  I mean,
[04:08:32.460 --> 04:08:33.460]  I love you very much.
[04:08:33.460 --> 04:08:34.460]  Yeah.
[04:08:34.460 --> 04:08:35.460]  It's good that you trust
[04:08:35.460 --> 04:08:36.460]  you that much.
[04:08:36.460 --> 04:08:37.460]  I've been...
[04:08:37.460 --> 04:08:38.460]  Oh, no,
[04:08:38.460 --> 04:08:39.460]  it's not good.
[04:08:39.460 --> 04:08:40.460]  I'm just saying that
[04:08:40.460 --> 04:08:41.460]  a lawyer can represent himself
[04:08:41.460 --> 04:08:42.460]  as a cool friend.
[04:08:42.460 --> 04:08:43.460]  I said,
[04:08:43.460 --> 04:08:44.460]  if you're representing yourself
[04:08:44.460 --> 04:08:45.460]  in America,
[04:08:45.460 --> 04:08:46.460]  you're going to laugh at
[04:08:46.460 --> 04:08:47.460]  the crazy breaking,
[04:08:47.460 --> 04:08:48.460]  okay?
[04:08:48.460 --> 04:08:49.460]  And if the boyfriend
[04:08:49.460 --> 04:08:50.460]  represents the girlfriend,
[04:08:50.460 --> 04:08:51.460]  you can work,
[04:08:51.460 --> 04:08:52.460]  right?
[04:08:52.460 --> 04:08:53.460]  And maybe this will also
[04:08:53.460 --> 04:08:54.460]  help the young
[04:08:54.460 --> 04:08:55.460]  and the vulnerable.
[04:08:55.460 --> 04:08:56.460]  Okay.
[04:08:56.460 --> 04:08:59.460]  And the court is a lot,
[04:08:59.460 --> 04:09:00.460]  a lot,
[04:09:00.460 --> 04:09:01.460]  a lot of emotions,
[04:09:01.460 --> 04:09:02.460]  right?
[04:09:02.460 --> 04:09:03.460]  Always remember
[04:09:03.460 --> 04:09:04.460]  that the judge
[04:09:04.460 --> 04:09:05.460]  cares about nothing
[04:09:05.460 --> 04:09:07.460]  except for the case.
[04:09:07.460 --> 04:09:08.460]  Is it true, though?
[04:09:08.460 --> 04:09:09.460]  Absolutely.
[04:09:09.460 --> 04:09:11.460]  And think about it.
[04:09:11.460 --> 04:09:12.460]  Think about it
[04:09:12.460 --> 04:09:14.460]  from this perspective.
[04:09:14.460 --> 04:09:15.460]  Their whole purpose
[04:09:15.460 --> 04:09:16.460]  for existing
[04:09:16.460 --> 04:09:17.460]  is to ensure
[04:09:17.460 --> 04:09:18.460]  the safety of children.
[04:09:18.460 --> 04:09:19.460]  That's what I want to
[04:09:19.460 --> 04:09:20.460]  believe is true,
[04:09:20.460 --> 04:09:21.460]  but that's not what I've seen.
[04:09:21.460 --> 04:09:22.460]  I've seen only
[04:09:22.460 --> 04:09:23.460]  people acting their
[04:09:23.460 --> 04:09:24.460]  own self-interest.
[04:09:24.460 --> 04:09:25.460]  I haven't seen anything
[04:09:25.460 --> 04:09:26.460]  else like that
[04:09:26.460 --> 04:09:27.460]  in this system.
[04:09:27.460 --> 04:09:28.460]  Well,
[04:09:28.460 --> 04:09:29.460]  when you talk about
[04:09:29.460 --> 04:09:30.460]  the lack of
[04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:31.460]  deep process in it,
[04:09:31.460 --> 04:09:32.460]  something,
[04:09:32.460 --> 04:09:33.460]  maybe some things are falling
[04:09:33.460 --> 04:09:34.460]  apart here,
[04:09:34.460 --> 04:09:35.460]  always come back
[04:09:35.460 --> 04:09:36.460]  to what the judge
[04:09:36.460 --> 04:09:38.460]  is going to ask
[04:09:38.460 --> 04:09:40.460]  and answer those questions
[04:09:40.460 --> 04:09:41.460]  for him.
[04:09:41.460 --> 04:09:43.460]  Does that make sense?
[04:09:43.460 --> 04:09:45.460]  Because one side is going to
[04:09:45.460 --> 04:09:46.460]  say,
[04:09:46.460 --> 04:09:47.460]  oh, this is best for the kids.
[04:09:47.460 --> 04:09:48.460]  And your argument says,
[04:09:48.460 --> 04:09:49.460]  this has to be
[04:09:49.460 --> 04:09:50.460]  best for the kids.
[04:09:50.460 --> 04:09:51.460]  That's what we're talking
[04:09:51.460 --> 04:09:52.460]  about.
[04:09:52.460 --> 04:09:53.460]  We got to make you
[04:09:53.460 --> 04:09:54.460]  look better.
[04:09:54.460 --> 04:09:55.460]  And you've got to make
[04:09:55.460 --> 04:09:56.460]  yourself look better
[04:09:56.460 --> 04:09:57.460]  than there's nothing
[04:09:57.460 --> 04:09:58.460]  left.
[04:09:58.460 --> 04:09:59.460]  Because then the judge
[04:09:59.460 --> 04:10:00.460]  is going to wait until
[04:10:00.460 --> 04:10:01.460]  and say,
[04:10:01.460 --> 04:10:02.460]  this is a better place.
[04:10:02.460 --> 04:10:03.460]  Was in the experience
[04:10:03.460 --> 04:10:04.460]  judged like,
[04:10:04.460 --> 04:10:05.460]  I heard
[04:10:05.460 --> 04:10:06.460]  Dominion is to
[04:10:06.460 --> 04:10:07.460]  know the difference
[04:10:07.460 --> 04:10:08.460]  between the lies
[04:10:08.460 --> 04:10:09.460]  and the fabrications.
[04:10:09.460 --> 04:10:10.460]  To know the difference
[04:10:10.460 --> 04:10:11.460]  between a crazy person
[04:10:11.460 --> 04:10:12.460]  that's just calling
[04:10:12.460 --> 04:10:13.460]  every day to
[04:10:13.460 --> 04:10:14.460]  facility off
[04:10:14.460 --> 04:10:15.460]  versus a person
[04:10:15.460 --> 04:10:16.460]  that's concerned.
[04:10:16.460 --> 04:10:17.460]  And how does the judge
[04:10:17.460 --> 04:10:18.460]  weigh that
[04:10:18.460 --> 04:10:19.460]  in front of them?
[04:10:19.460 --> 04:10:20.460]  To weigh that with
[04:10:20.460 --> 04:10:21.460]  what the judge
[04:10:21.460 --> 04:10:22.460]  needed to lay it out
[04:10:22.460 --> 04:10:23.460]  in front of them?
[04:10:23.460 --> 04:10:24.460]  What's the
[04:10:24.460 --> 04:10:25.460]  best kind of evidence
[04:10:25.460 --> 04:10:26.460]  in front of them?
[04:10:26.460 --> 04:10:27.460]  OK.
[04:10:27.460 --> 04:10:28.460]  So you need
[04:10:28.460 --> 04:10:29.460]  to, like,
[04:10:29.460 --> 04:10:30.460]  get strong
[04:10:30.460 --> 04:10:31.460]  and, again,
[04:10:31.460 --> 04:10:32.460]  you know,
[04:10:32.460 --> 04:10:33.460]  those are the lawyers
[04:10:33.460 --> 04:10:34.460]  who, like,
[04:10:34.460 --> 04:10:35.460]  you need to
[04:10:35.460 --> 04:10:36.460]  try to organize
[04:10:36.460 --> 04:10:37.460]  your response
[04:10:37.460 --> 04:10:38.460]  to those, like,
[04:10:38.460 --> 04:10:39.460]  your buttocks
[04:10:39.460 --> 04:10:40.460]  because they're
[04:10:40.460 --> 04:10:41.460]  representing the facts
[04:10:41.460 --> 04:10:42.460]  to the judge, not.
[04:10:42.460 --> 04:10:43.460]  I mean, you could, too.
[04:10:43.460 --> 04:10:44.460]  No, you're right.
[04:10:44.460 --> 04:10:45.460]  We're going to get there.
[04:10:45.460 --> 04:10:46.460]  Yeah, OK.
[04:10:46.460 --> 04:10:47.460]  But thank you, yeah.
[04:10:47.460 --> 04:10:48.460]  I'm worried because
[04:10:48.460 --> 04:10:49.460]  I looked up this judge
[04:10:49.460 --> 04:10:50.460]  and her reviews were
[04:10:50.460 --> 04:10:51.460]  not good.
[04:10:51.460 --> 04:10:52.460]  And I don't expect her
[04:10:52.460 --> 04:10:53.460]  to have any,
[04:10:53.460 --> 04:10:54.460]  you know,
[04:10:54.460 --> 04:10:55.460]  these are the
[04:10:55.460 --> 04:10:56.460]  things.
[04:10:56.460 --> 04:10:57.460]  But this was
[04:10:57.460 --> 04:10:58.460]  100% bad.
[04:10:58.460 --> 04:10:59.460]  There was nothing good.
[04:10:59.460 --> 04:11:00.460]  I guess the people that
[04:11:00.460 --> 04:11:01.460]  put these are more
[04:11:01.460 --> 04:11:02.460]  motivated to write this.
[04:11:03.460 --> 04:11:04.460]  I know that, too.
[04:11:04.460 --> 04:11:05.460]  Like, I've read
[04:11:05.460 --> 04:11:06.460]  through the lines.
[04:11:06.460 --> 04:11:07.460]  I've been one
[04:11:07.460 --> 04:11:08.460]  through lots of cases,
[04:11:08.460 --> 04:11:09.460]  but I didn't see anybody say
[04:11:09.460 --> 04:11:10.460]  she did great by
[04:11:10.460 --> 04:11:11.460]  not one person.
[04:11:11.460 --> 04:11:12.460]  I only see
[04:11:12.460 --> 04:11:13.460]  she's married to another
[04:11:13.460 --> 04:11:15.460]  judge in that same court.
[04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:16.460]  I see he was
[04:11:16.460 --> 04:11:17.460]  admonished for his
[04:11:17.460 --> 04:11:18.460]  handling of the situation.
[04:11:18.460 --> 04:11:19.460]  She was admonished for this.
[04:11:19.460 --> 04:11:20.460]  They were,
[04:11:20.460 --> 04:11:21.460]  they were
[04:11:21.460 --> 04:11:22.460]  severe.
[04:11:22.460 --> 04:11:23.460]  Like, I'm
[04:11:23.460 --> 04:11:24.460]  I'm
[04:11:24.460 --> 04:11:25.460]  I was focused on
[04:11:25.460 --> 04:11:26.460]  what's successful,
[04:11:26.460 --> 04:11:27.460]  the people that are successful,
[04:11:27.460 --> 04:11:28.460]  right?
[04:11:28.460 --> 04:11:29.460]  How were they successful?
[04:11:29.460 --> 04:11:31.460]  They presented
[04:11:31.460 --> 04:11:32.460]  evidence that
[04:11:32.460 --> 04:11:33.460]  was more favorable
[04:11:33.460 --> 04:11:34.460]  for each child.
[04:11:34.460 --> 04:11:35.460]  Oh.
[04:11:36.460 --> 04:11:37.460]  That's it.
[04:11:37.460 --> 04:11:39.460]  It's very narrow,
[04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:40.460]  and it's really narrow.
[04:11:40.460 --> 04:11:41.460]  But I do that.
[04:11:41.460 --> 04:11:42.460]  That's why I'm here.
[04:11:42.460 --> 04:11:43.460]  That's why I'm frustrated.
[04:11:43.460 --> 04:11:44.460]  Because this is what
[04:11:44.460 --> 04:11:45.460]  I do.
[04:11:45.460 --> 04:11:46.460]  Well, that's what
[04:11:46.460 --> 04:11:47.460]  you need to give attorney.
[04:11:47.460 --> 04:11:48.460]  It's clear.
[04:11:48.460 --> 04:11:49.460]  It's clear.
[04:11:49.460 --> 04:11:50.460]  If you walk in the room,
[04:11:50.460 --> 04:11:51.460]  if you guys walk in there,
[04:11:51.460 --> 04:11:52.460]  anybody who's walked
[04:11:52.460 --> 04:11:53.460]  into my life
[04:11:53.460 --> 04:11:55.460]  and read to Steve,
[04:11:55.460 --> 04:11:56.460]  it's night and day.
[04:11:56.460 --> 04:11:57.460]  Obviously,
[04:11:57.460 --> 04:11:58.460]  Marla belongs to this.
[04:11:58.460 --> 04:11:59.460]  It's,
[04:11:59.460 --> 04:12:00.460]  I'm not saying that this is
[04:12:00.460 --> 04:12:01.460]  subjectively.
[04:12:01.460 --> 04:12:02.460]  I mean, I am,
[04:12:02.460 --> 04:12:03.460]  but it's clear.
[04:12:03.460 --> 04:12:04.460]  But to have these
[04:12:04.460 --> 04:12:05.460]  these people do that
[04:12:05.460 --> 04:12:07.460]  and come up with
[04:12:07.460 --> 04:12:08.460]  this,
[04:12:08.460 --> 04:12:09.460]  when you read it,
[04:12:09.460 --> 04:12:10.460]  you'll see.
[04:12:10.460 --> 04:12:11.460]  It's,
[04:12:11.460 --> 04:12:12.460]  that scares me
[04:12:12.460 --> 04:12:13.460]  because that shows
[04:12:13.460 --> 04:12:14.460]  that someone is
[04:12:14.460 --> 04:12:15.460]  something else is going on.
[04:12:15.460 --> 04:12:16.460]  There's something else
[04:12:16.460 --> 04:12:17.460]  I don't know.
[04:12:17.460 --> 04:12:18.460]  I don't know how to gauge it.
[04:12:18.460 --> 04:12:19.460]  I don't know how to weigh it.
[04:12:19.460 --> 04:12:20.460]  I don't know what it is
[04:12:20.460 --> 04:12:21.460]  and scaring it.
[04:12:23.460 --> 04:12:24.460]  It's not
[04:12:24.460 --> 04:12:25.460]  how it should be.
[04:12:25.460 --> 04:12:26.460]  You know,
[04:12:26.460 --> 04:12:27.460]  it's how it should be.
[04:12:27.460 --> 04:12:28.460]  That's the problem.
[04:12:28.460 --> 04:12:29.460]  I held you earlier.
[04:12:29.460 --> 04:12:30.460]  We're honest.
[04:12:30.460 --> 04:12:31.460]  I'll be honest with you now.
[04:12:31.460 --> 04:12:32.460]  It's just scary.
[04:12:32.460 --> 04:12:34.460]  It's just scary things.
[04:12:34.460 --> 04:12:35.460]  That's,
[04:12:35.460 --> 04:12:37.460]  that's Marie's child
[04:12:37.460 --> 04:12:38.460]  but it's also yours.
[04:12:38.460 --> 04:12:39.460]  So,
[04:12:39.460 --> 04:12:41.460]  you've got to focus on those things.
[04:12:41.460 --> 04:12:42.460]  And I'll,
[04:12:42.460 --> 04:12:43.460]  and I'll give you something.
[04:12:43.460 --> 04:12:44.460]  I'm not going to try
[04:12:44.460 --> 04:12:45.460]  but hearing this,
[04:12:45.460 --> 04:12:47.460]  some of what I picked up on
[04:12:47.460 --> 04:12:49.460]  is an allegation of a beard,
[04:12:49.460 --> 04:12:50.460]  of a bruise.
[04:12:50.460 --> 04:12:51.460]  Yeah.
[04:12:51.460 --> 04:12:52.460]  A black eye.
[04:12:52.460 --> 04:12:53.460]  Okay.
[04:12:53.460 --> 04:12:54.460]  Don't be mad about the allegation.
[04:12:54.460 --> 04:12:55.460]  How do you get privy?
[04:12:55.460 --> 04:12:56.460]  I know,
[04:12:56.460 --> 04:12:57.460]  but you can,
[04:12:57.460 --> 04:12:58.460]  but that's why they picked the shit
[04:12:58.460 --> 04:12:59.460]  that's hard to disprove.
[04:12:59.460 --> 04:13:00.460]  How do I go and disprove your phone?
[04:13:00.460 --> 04:13:01.460]  We have photos from the game.
[04:13:01.460 --> 04:13:02.460]  Well,
[04:13:02.460 --> 04:13:03.460]  you said you also had a video crew
[04:13:03.460 --> 04:13:04.460]  that was following you.
[04:13:04.460 --> 04:13:05.460]  We have a video crew
[04:13:05.460 --> 04:13:06.460]  and we have photos of Marlon
[04:13:06.460 --> 04:13:07.460]  from that day.
[04:13:07.460 --> 04:13:08.460]  Okay.
[04:13:08.460 --> 04:13:09.460]  So,
[04:13:09.460 --> 04:13:10.460]  so then someone says,
[04:13:10.460 --> 04:13:11.460]  oh, well,
[04:13:11.460 --> 04:13:12.460]  you need to produce those
[04:13:12.460 --> 04:13:14.460]  to show that that allegation is false.
[04:13:14.460 --> 04:13:16.460]  You just have to focus on that.
[04:13:16.460 --> 04:13:17.460]  Does that make sense?
[04:13:17.460 --> 04:13:18.460]  That's,
[04:13:18.460 --> 04:13:19.460]  yeah,
[04:13:19.460 --> 04:13:20.460]  I mean,
[04:13:20.460 --> 04:13:21.460]  like it's easy.
[04:13:21.460 --> 04:13:22.460]  And you need to.
[04:13:22.460 --> 04:13:23.460]  It sounds easy.
[04:13:23.460 --> 04:13:24.460]  I can do that
[04:13:24.460 --> 04:13:25.460]  but they can only say
[04:13:25.460 --> 04:13:26.460]  something else.
[04:13:26.460 --> 04:13:27.460]  How do you disprove Marlon
[04:13:27.460 --> 04:13:28.460]  going through the trash?
[04:13:28.460 --> 04:13:29.460]  Scouraging for food?
[04:13:29.460 --> 04:13:30.460]  How do I disprove that?
[04:13:30.460 --> 04:13:31.460]  At 1 a.m.,
[04:13:31.460 --> 04:13:32.460]  she says,
[04:13:32.460 --> 04:13:33.460]  he's going through the trash
[04:13:33.460 --> 04:13:34.460]  alone,
[04:13:34.460 --> 04:13:35.460]  trying to get food out of
[04:13:35.460 --> 04:13:36.460]  garbage dumpsters.
[04:13:36.460 --> 04:13:37.460]  Marlon,
[04:13:37.460 --> 04:13:38.460]  an eight-year-old.
[04:13:38.460 --> 04:13:39.460]  How do I disprove that?
[04:13:39.460 --> 04:13:40.460]  And that's,
[04:13:40.460 --> 04:13:41.460]  that's the thing.
[04:13:41.460 --> 04:13:42.460]  You can't disprove it.
[04:13:42.460 --> 04:13:43.460]  You can't prove a negative, right?
[04:13:43.460 --> 04:13:44.460]  You can't disprove.
[04:13:44.460 --> 04:13:45.460]  Go disprove it.
[04:13:45.460 --> 04:13:46.460]  You're not,
[04:13:46.460 --> 04:13:47.460]  tell me,
[04:13:47.460 --> 04:13:48.460]  prove me you're not guilty.
[04:13:48.460 --> 04:13:49.460]  A little garlet letter?
[04:13:49.460 --> 04:13:50.460]  Yeah.
[04:13:50.460 --> 04:13:51.460]  Yeah.
[04:13:51.460 --> 04:13:52.460]  That's,
[04:13:52.460 --> 04:13:53.460]  that's,
[04:13:53.460 --> 04:13:54.460]  that's,
[04:13:54.460 --> 04:13:55.460]  that's what I'm trying to say.
[04:13:55.460 --> 04:13:56.460]  I'm trying to go to the
[04:13:56.460 --> 04:13:57.460]  top of these lawyers.
[04:13:57.460 --> 04:13:58.460]  Like,
[04:13:58.460 --> 04:13:59.460]  they've seen it all.
[04:13:59.460 --> 04:14:00.460]  They've seen,
[04:14:00.460 --> 04:14:01.460]  you know,
[04:14:01.460 --> 04:14:02.460]  they've probably seen
[04:14:02.460 --> 04:14:03.460]  elements of your story before
[04:14:03.460 --> 04:14:04.460]  and they know what,
[04:14:04.460 --> 04:14:05.460]  they hopefully they will know
[04:14:05.460 --> 04:14:08.460]  what a good response to those
[04:14:08.460 --> 04:14:09.460]  things are.
[04:14:09.460 --> 04:14:10.460]  And another thing,
[04:14:10.460 --> 04:14:11.460]  it's not just being a good,
[04:14:11.460 --> 04:14:12.460]  like,
[04:14:12.460 --> 04:14:13.460]  you can be a vicious,
[04:14:13.460 --> 04:14:14.460]  hard-going lawyer,
[04:14:14.460 --> 04:14:15.460]  but if you don't understand
[04:14:15.460 --> 04:14:16.460]  and you don't understand
[04:14:16.460 --> 04:14:17.460]  the process,
[04:14:17.460 --> 04:14:18.460]  how are you going to be
[04:14:18.460 --> 04:14:19.460]  at the other side,
[04:14:19.460 --> 04:14:20.460]  whether you want or not?
[04:14:20.460 --> 04:14:21.460]  Yes.
[04:14:21.460 --> 04:14:22.460]  You have to understand
[04:14:22.460 --> 04:14:22.960]  Yes.
[04:14:22.960 --> 04:14:24.960]  You have to understand your situation.
[04:14:24.960 --> 04:14:25.460]  We don't.
[04:14:25.460 --> 04:14:25.960]  We don't.
[04:14:25.960 --> 04:14:26.960]  He didn't tell us anything.
[04:14:26.960 --> 04:14:29.960]  He didn't want that job to be done.
[04:14:29.960 --> 04:14:31.960]  He was using us for his own case.
[04:14:31.960 --> 04:14:33.460]  Can you see that's pretty tricky?
[04:14:33.460 --> 04:14:36.960]  I can't tell you what to do with your attorney to fire that and get a new one or what kind
[04:14:36.960 --> 04:14:37.460]  of attorney.
[04:14:37.460 --> 04:14:44.460]  I just can't do that because I think I'm starting to be in a certain spot as any human would
[04:14:44.460 --> 04:14:45.960]  just do any process.
[04:14:45.960 --> 04:14:48.960]  You have to understand the other side of it.
[04:14:48.960 --> 04:14:49.460]  I did.
[04:14:49.460 --> 04:14:54.460]  I'm telling you, we accidentally put ourselves in the middle of another case.
[04:14:54.460 --> 04:14:57.460]  We're being used for someone else's case.
[04:14:57.460 --> 04:15:04.460]  The lawyer we found, the woman that we recall, wants us to help her with her bigger case.
[04:15:04.460 --> 04:15:05.960]  That's what we're used for.
[04:15:05.960 --> 04:15:08.460]  So our lawyer was not working our best interest.
[04:15:08.460 --> 04:15:11.460]  He's working for his best interest and her best interest.
[04:15:11.460 --> 04:15:12.460]  That's the problem.
[04:15:12.460 --> 04:15:21.460]  And that's why I'm fucking, that woman, the judge, knows that because he's been working
[04:15:21.460 --> 04:15:24.460]  in that group for 30, 20 years.
[04:15:24.460 --> 04:15:25.460]  Everyone knows each other.
[04:15:25.460 --> 04:15:26.460]  It's so ancestral down there.
[04:15:26.460 --> 04:15:30.460]  She knows that, but she's still accepted that what she did.
[04:15:30.460 --> 04:15:31.460]  And that scares me too.
[04:15:31.460 --> 04:15:32.460]  He's judged.
[04:15:32.460 --> 04:15:38.460]  The whole thing used to be, you have to get paternal affairs down there and fucking clean this place up because something's wrong here.
[04:15:38.460 --> 04:15:40.460]  And these are children.
[04:15:40.460 --> 04:15:41.460]  It's fucked up.
[04:15:41.460 --> 04:15:43.460]  You know, they think they're above the law now.
[04:15:43.460 --> 04:15:44.460]  These people are down there.
[04:15:44.460 --> 04:15:45.460]  It's fucked up.
[04:15:45.460 --> 04:15:46.460]  The egos are so big.
[04:15:46.460 --> 04:15:47.460]  Nope.
[04:15:47.460 --> 04:15:51.460]  Like, I've seen big egos, like bankers, like billionaires.
[04:15:51.460 --> 04:15:54.460]  They don't say anything against these lawyers and the judges.
[04:15:54.460 --> 04:15:55.460]  It's crazy.
[04:15:55.460 --> 04:15:57.460]  But we don't have your back.
[04:15:57.460 --> 04:15:59.460]  We're going to have your case.
[04:15:59.460 --> 04:16:02.460]  That's what I'm telling you.
[04:16:02.460 --> 04:16:10.460]  For example, he said, clear as day in writing, I am counsel for Bob Brooksman.
[04:16:10.460 --> 04:16:11.460]  Marie calls him last night.
[04:16:11.460 --> 04:16:12.460]  We record the conversation.
[04:16:12.460 --> 04:16:13.460]  He doesn't know.
[04:16:13.460 --> 04:16:18.460]  Why didn't you say to Tim and Lucy that you were Vowell's counsel?
[04:16:18.460 --> 04:16:19.460]  I'll fucking Vowell.
[04:16:19.460 --> 04:16:20.460]  Don't listen to him.
[04:16:20.460 --> 04:16:22.460]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[04:16:22.460 --> 04:16:23.460]  Vowell's an idiot.
[04:16:23.460 --> 04:16:24.460]  Vowell's a bully.
[04:16:24.460 --> 04:16:25.460]  He's going to ruin you.
[04:16:25.460 --> 04:16:26.460]  He's going to screw up your case.
[04:16:26.460 --> 04:16:27.460]  You need to drop Vowell.
[04:16:27.460 --> 04:16:29.460]  No, but you didn't answer my question.
[04:16:29.460 --> 04:16:31.460]  How is it that you said this?
[04:16:31.460 --> 04:16:33.460]  I mean, it's right here in the email.
[04:16:33.460 --> 04:16:34.460]  I'm looking at it.
[04:16:34.460 --> 04:16:35.460]  I did not say that, Marie.
[04:16:35.460 --> 04:16:36.460]  I said, I'm your counsel.
[04:16:36.460 --> 04:16:37.460]  I'm Marie's counsel.
[04:16:37.460 --> 04:16:38.460]  And I'm here to help.
[04:16:38.460 --> 04:16:39.460]  That's it.
[04:16:39.460 --> 04:16:40.460]  You want to talk about this?
[04:16:40.460 --> 04:16:41.460]  You want to talk about going with Vowell?
[04:16:41.460 --> 04:16:42.460]  I can walk away anytime.
[04:16:42.460 --> 04:16:45.460]  I don't need this case for 30 minutes of this.
[04:16:45.460 --> 04:16:46.460]  All right.
[04:16:46.460 --> 04:16:48.460]  He was denying reality.
[04:16:48.460 --> 04:16:49.460]  Okay.
[04:16:49.460 --> 04:16:50.460]  That's scary.
[04:16:50.460 --> 04:16:51.460]  That's your attorney.
[04:16:51.460 --> 04:16:52.460]  That was our attorney.
[04:16:52.460 --> 04:16:53.460]  That's my attorney.
[04:16:53.460 --> 04:16:54.460]  That's your attorney.
[04:16:54.460 --> 04:16:57.460]  Yeah, but that's also the relationship with the judge.
[04:16:57.460 --> 04:16:58.460]  That's what I'm saying.
[04:16:58.460 --> 04:17:00.460]  It's like that, don't it?
[04:17:00.460 --> 04:17:03.460]  It seems like we're correcting it from wrong.
[04:17:03.460 --> 04:17:06.460]  Your frustration is that you believe that there's corruption at the judicial level.
[04:17:06.460 --> 04:17:07.460]  Like the judge is corrupt.
[04:17:07.460 --> 04:17:08.460]  Yeah.
[04:17:08.460 --> 04:17:09.460]  That's the problem.
[04:17:09.460 --> 04:17:10.460]  Absolutely.
[04:17:10.460 --> 04:17:11.460]  Yeah.
[04:17:11.460 --> 04:17:12.460]  So, yeah.
[04:17:12.460 --> 04:17:13.460]  No experience with this at all.
[04:17:13.460 --> 04:17:15.460]  I'm just telling you, my experience with this is where I talk.
[04:17:15.460 --> 04:17:19.460]  Well, it's because nothing we can tell you about the process is going to make any sense
[04:17:19.460 --> 04:17:21.460]  if you don't trust the system, right?
[04:17:21.460 --> 04:17:24.460]  Because right now you don't trust the system because you think the judge is corrupt, right?
[04:17:24.460 --> 04:17:27.460]  So, then the question is, what is our solution?
[04:17:27.460 --> 04:17:28.460]  We can't just correct the problem, right?
[04:17:28.460 --> 04:17:29.460]  That's right.
[04:17:29.460 --> 04:17:30.460]  We have to find a solution to it.
[04:17:30.460 --> 04:17:33.460]  And I cannot be, I can't be an asshole and just do it for myself.
[04:17:33.460 --> 04:17:35.460]  And that's why I say, well, there's other people's children.
[04:17:35.460 --> 04:17:39.460]  So, if I read about our mind about their kids being taken away from them, we can't...
[04:17:39.460 --> 04:17:40.460]  Hold on.
[04:17:40.460 --> 04:17:41.460]  Hold on.
[04:17:41.460 --> 04:17:42.460]  Right?
[04:17:42.460 --> 04:17:46.460]  So, like, we can talk all day with you about how to help you.
[04:17:46.460 --> 04:17:51.460]  But if you don't trust the judge, nothing that we can say is going to make any difference, right?
[04:17:51.460 --> 04:17:57.460]  So, as far as being a corrupt judge, like if you wanted us to investigate the judge for
[04:17:57.460 --> 04:18:01.460]  public corruption or something like that, that's a whole other case, a whole other issue that
[04:18:01.460 --> 04:18:04.460]  we would have to resolve that would take years.
[04:18:04.460 --> 04:18:06.460]  It's not going to help you.
[04:18:06.460 --> 04:18:08.460]  So, how do you navigate it?
[04:18:08.460 --> 04:18:09.460]  Right, right.
[04:18:09.460 --> 04:18:14.460]  So, the best advice I can give you is that, as unfair as it sounds right now, there seems
[04:18:14.460 --> 04:18:17.460]  like there's a lot of things that are going on with the judge.
[04:18:17.460 --> 04:18:19.460]  What we've talked about is true.
[04:18:19.460 --> 04:18:22.460]  The judges do have a kid that interests that hand.
[04:18:22.460 --> 04:18:27.460]  Like, you can form a whole conspiracy about why this judge wants to take Marlowe away from
[04:18:27.460 --> 04:18:28.460]  you.
[04:18:28.460 --> 04:18:29.460]  And it's about Marlowe.
[04:18:29.460 --> 04:18:32.460]  And that's what we have to focus on, right?
[04:18:32.460 --> 04:18:36.460]  Because if the judge is trying to, you know, screw someone over...
[04:18:36.460 --> 04:18:38.460]  You're going back to the same...
[04:18:38.460 --> 04:18:44.460]  Okay, so, what's our solution going to be for a corrupt judge that is just out to fuck
[04:18:44.460 --> 04:18:45.460]  everyone?
[04:18:45.460 --> 04:18:46.460]  That's not what I'm saying.
[04:18:46.460 --> 04:18:47.460]  I'm not saying...
[04:18:47.460 --> 04:18:49.460]  Do you know how it comes off?
[04:18:49.460 --> 04:18:53.460]  Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like that.
[04:18:53.460 --> 04:19:02.460]  I mean, in this specific case, we accidentally found a lawyer that has an agenda to get another
[04:19:02.460 --> 04:19:03.460]  guy, right?
[04:19:03.460 --> 04:19:08.460]  We fell into this trap, into a circle of friends, they're like a cabal, they're very close to
[04:19:08.460 --> 04:19:10.460]  each other, they're married to each other for fuck's sake.
[04:19:10.460 --> 04:19:13.460]  You know each other very well for 20 plus years.
[04:19:13.460 --> 04:19:17.460]  They feel like they're above the law, they have their own law structure there.
[04:19:17.460 --> 04:19:20.460]  They decide what happens, not the law.
[04:19:20.460 --> 04:19:27.460]  And we saw accidentally the triple lambing out into this little cabal and we became a
[04:19:27.460 --> 04:19:29.460]  tool all of a sudden.
[04:19:29.460 --> 04:19:33.460]  Now, when we drop this guy, he's not going to be happy about that.
[04:19:33.460 --> 04:19:35.460]  He knows the judge very well.
[04:19:35.460 --> 04:19:37.460]  Very fucking well, they're very close.
[04:19:37.460 --> 04:19:38.460]  You can see it in the...
[04:19:38.460 --> 04:19:40.460]  You know, they say don't record...
[04:19:40.460 --> 04:19:41.460]  You know how they record this shit?
[04:19:41.460 --> 04:19:42.460]  The trials?
[04:19:42.460 --> 04:19:44.460]  They fucking record everything.
[04:19:44.460 --> 04:19:51.460]  You know, and so we went through it last night and heard again how he did not defend us.
[04:19:51.460 --> 04:19:53.460]  I mean, I don't want to get too much into it.
[04:19:53.460 --> 04:19:58.460]  We actively tried to get him out of the room knowing that Murray was lying in the belt
[04:19:58.460 --> 04:19:59.460]  under the room, don't worry about it.
[04:19:59.460 --> 04:20:02.460]  You know Murray, you really have to get him out of the room.
[04:20:02.460 --> 04:20:04.460]  And that's our lawyer throwing us under the bus.
[04:20:04.460 --> 04:20:06.460]  And the judge knew it.
[04:20:06.460 --> 04:20:08.460]  I don't know how to describe it.
[04:20:08.460 --> 04:20:12.460]  You think if you had a new lawyer it would change the situation?
[04:20:12.460 --> 04:20:13.460]  No.
[04:20:14.460 --> 04:20:17.460]  But that's a solution, I think, on the table right now.
[04:20:17.460 --> 04:20:18.460]  I don't know.
[04:20:18.460 --> 04:20:21.460]  There might be a good guy, like a stand-up guy.
[04:20:21.460 --> 04:20:24.460]  And he's told us it's a whole other system down there.
[04:20:24.460 --> 04:20:28.460]  You need to get a lawyer that's court ordered that knows that system.
[04:20:28.460 --> 04:20:29.460]  You know, that's your best bet.
[04:20:29.460 --> 04:20:32.460]  I can get you an expensive lawyer that can do it for you, too.
[04:20:32.460 --> 04:20:35.460]  But he's not going to be as good as the people that are in that court.
[04:20:35.460 --> 04:20:37.460]  And that means that it is corrupt.
[04:20:37.460 --> 04:20:38.460]  They do it amongst each other.
[04:20:38.460 --> 04:20:42.460]  They have their own star chambers, certain things.
[04:20:42.460 --> 04:20:47.460]  And so it's Sava who's creating fucking evidence, and she's a social worker.
[04:20:47.460 --> 04:20:50.460]  She's supposed to have the child's best interests at heart.
[04:20:50.460 --> 04:20:51.460]  That is her.
[04:20:51.460 --> 04:20:54.460]  When she was hired she could pay $100,000 a year to do that.
[04:20:54.460 --> 04:20:56.460]  And the other guy, 200,000,000.
[04:20:56.460 --> 04:20:58.460]  They're supposed to be good at their job.
[04:20:58.460 --> 04:21:00.460]  Comes in and starts fucking lying.
[04:21:00.460 --> 04:21:02.460]  And changing the narrative, read it.
[04:21:02.460 --> 04:21:04.460]  See how the narrative changed after page 15?
[04:21:04.460 --> 04:21:06.460]  The narrative changed dramatically.
[04:21:06.460 --> 04:21:07.460]  You'll see.
[04:21:07.460 --> 04:21:09.460]  How do you fight that?
[04:21:09.460 --> 04:21:11.460]  That's fucked up.
[04:21:12.460 --> 04:21:13.660]  That's what's fucked up.
[04:21:13.660 --> 04:21:16.900]  What I was my plan was if I am all I have options,
[04:21:16.900 --> 04:21:19.940]  I'm going to throw it onto the group, more than three
[04:21:19.940 --> 04:21:21.740]  of them, and say, look, this is a problem.
[04:21:21.740 --> 04:21:23.340]  I need your help.
[04:21:23.340 --> 04:21:24.660]  What can you do?
[04:21:24.660 --> 04:21:28.500]  And that's done with my last, but then you got something.
[04:21:28.500 --> 04:21:29.000]  It's good.
[04:21:29.000 --> 04:21:31.180]  I want to get that was my other choice.
[04:21:31.180 --> 04:21:33.060]  Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
[04:21:33.060 --> 04:21:34.940]  And it's from Marlowe, I got to go do it.
[04:21:34.940 --> 04:21:36.540]  No, totally.
[04:21:36.540 --> 04:21:39.780]  I mean, in a year, you said to walk away from here,
[04:21:39.780 --> 04:21:42.260]  but look at other references for lawyers.
[04:21:42.260 --> 04:21:44.980]  Because you always think about a dad or a friend.
[04:21:44.980 --> 04:21:47.540]  They had their own reasons for introducing you
[04:21:47.540 --> 04:21:49.220]  to that lawyer.
[04:21:49.220 --> 04:21:52.060]  So if you're bowling under and hearing me, it's systemic.
[04:21:52.060 --> 04:21:55.740]  Like, I'm not having a great, great burden in the world.
[04:21:55.740 --> 04:21:57.020]  It wins everything.
[04:21:57.020 --> 04:21:59.820]  But not in this world, because this world is
[04:21:59.820 --> 04:22:01.420]  run by these people.
[04:22:01.420 --> 04:22:02.900]  They make their own goals.
[04:22:02.900 --> 04:22:07.580]  The law that was first followed, they create their own laws.
[04:22:07.580 --> 04:22:08.460]  That's a problem.
[04:22:09.420 --> 04:22:11.180]  Let's read the reader for us.
[04:22:11.180 --> 04:22:16.740]  I think it's going back to thinking about why we're better
[04:22:16.740 --> 04:22:19.380]  off going in with a lawyer than by yourself.
[04:22:19.380 --> 04:22:20.380]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[04:22:20.380 --> 04:22:21.860]  Yeah, I agree.
[04:22:21.860 --> 04:22:22.860]  Absolutely.
[04:22:22.860 --> 04:22:23.860]  No, absolutely.
[04:22:23.860 --> 04:22:24.860]  Yeah.
[04:22:24.860 --> 04:22:25.860]  I'm going with the lawyer.
[04:22:25.860 --> 04:22:26.860]  We're fine with the lawyer.
[04:22:26.860 --> 04:22:29.340]  The thing that we're trying to say,
[04:22:29.340 --> 04:22:31.660]  like, here's the thing, you have to either trust
[04:22:31.660 --> 04:22:33.780]  that what we're saying is from experience,
[04:22:33.780 --> 04:22:35.380]  or you don't have to take our opinion.
[04:22:35.380 --> 04:22:37.100]  I mean, it's just a opinion of three.
[04:22:37.860 --> 04:22:39.820]  I'm just so media all the data, I just want
[04:22:39.820 --> 04:22:41.380]  to make sure you have everything.
[04:22:41.380 --> 04:22:43.900]  So the thing would be, if your attorney also
[04:22:43.900 --> 04:22:47.300]  sees that there's this corrupt system where the judge is
[04:22:47.300 --> 04:22:49.100]  in bed with everyone else, they may
[04:22:49.100 --> 04:22:50.220]  be able to change a venue.
[04:22:50.220 --> 04:22:51.180]  They need to do something.
[04:22:51.180 --> 04:22:53.260]  But they would have that knowledge, right?
[04:22:53.260 --> 04:22:54.540]  Like, I don't have it now.
[04:22:54.540 --> 04:22:57.180]  They're not a, I don't do child custody battles,
[04:22:57.180 --> 04:22:59.500]  but they need to be based on doubt defense, certainly.
[04:22:59.500 --> 04:23:00.940]  A couple of different occasions.
[04:23:00.940 --> 04:23:03.980]  But those are different situations, different judges
[04:23:03.980 --> 04:23:04.500]  to people.
[04:23:04.500 --> 04:23:06.740]  So whatever training you get, we'll
[04:23:06.740 --> 04:23:08.300]  be able to look after your best interests.
[04:23:08.300 --> 04:23:10.180]  The point would be, though, is you have to trust
[04:23:10.180 --> 04:23:11.740]  that that attorney is going to be good,
[04:23:11.740 --> 04:23:13.700]  and is going to be looking after your best interests.
[04:23:13.700 --> 04:23:15.540]  So do your research, and we know we
[04:23:15.540 --> 04:23:18.180]  can help with that, if that would be the best option.
[04:23:18.180 --> 04:23:19.980]  But I'm trying to find a good solution for you,
[04:23:19.980 --> 04:23:21.740]  because I don't want you to walk away from here thinking,
[04:23:21.740 --> 04:23:23.980]  like, well, if I don't care, I do want to help you.
[04:23:23.980 --> 04:23:26.260]  But we need to think of realistic ways we can help you.
[04:23:26.260 --> 04:23:27.820]  And that would be the best way to do it.
[04:23:27.820 --> 04:23:28.820]  Sorry, maybe you're right.
[04:23:28.820 --> 04:23:29.660]  I'm just thinking.
[04:23:29.660 --> 04:23:31.860]  So realistic way would be to play their game,
[04:23:31.860 --> 04:23:33.700]  find out what their rules are, and play their game.
[04:23:33.700 --> 04:23:36.700]  So that's the end of it.
[04:23:37.660 --> 04:23:39.540]  I mean, I don't want you to be upset.
[04:23:39.540 --> 04:23:41.860]  I mean, it's not emotional, and I understand.
[04:23:41.860 --> 04:23:43.060]  I've always started throwing out there,
[04:23:43.060 --> 04:23:44.820]  seeing that we're interested in doing this whole,
[04:23:44.820 --> 04:23:47.420]  let's take down the system and create a new system in its place.
[04:23:47.420 --> 04:23:49.420]  But I don't think you're there yet.
[04:23:49.420 --> 04:23:51.220]  But I do want to do that at some point.
[04:23:51.220 --> 04:23:52.980]  But right now, I have to get Marla focused.
[04:23:52.980 --> 04:23:54.940]  I'm just going to say, right now, it's play their game.
[04:23:54.940 --> 04:23:55.780]  That's fine.
[04:23:55.780 --> 04:23:56.660]  It's perfectly fine.
[04:23:56.660 --> 04:24:01.620]  But yeah, OK, no worries.
[04:24:01.620 --> 04:24:04.660]  And I think some of those things are going to be in your dress.
[04:24:04.660 --> 04:24:05.540]  You all right?
[04:24:05.540 --> 04:24:11.660]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of a year of that whole process.
[04:24:11.660 --> 04:24:16.060]  When we talk here, and I think what I want to make sure you
[04:24:16.060 --> 04:24:19.020]  understand is that we'll focus on the game special,
[04:24:19.020 --> 04:24:21.620]  because that's your immediate need, right?
[04:24:21.620 --> 04:24:23.540]  And then there's the overall need.
[04:24:23.540 --> 04:24:25.460]  What can we solve quickly?
[04:24:25.460 --> 04:24:26.820]  What needs to be addressed quickly?
[04:24:26.820 --> 04:24:31.060]  And then the bigger thing, the bigger aspect of it.
[04:24:31.060 --> 04:24:36.180]  It's not that we're not interested in that, because we are.
[04:24:36.180 --> 04:24:38.380]  Yeah, one thing at a time.
[04:24:38.380 --> 04:24:41.740]  Well, you're here right here.
[04:24:41.740 --> 04:24:44.500]  What's your number one goal?
[04:24:44.500 --> 04:24:46.380]  Marla, right?
[04:24:46.380 --> 04:24:48.780]  So when you ask a question, it's not
[04:24:48.780 --> 04:24:52.860]  that we're side stepping the issues, whatever it is.
[04:24:52.860 --> 04:24:56.100]  We're focused on, because we're addressing.
[04:24:56.100 --> 04:24:57.540]  Oh, no, absolutely.
[04:24:57.540 --> 04:24:58.420]  You're sorry.
[04:24:58.420 --> 04:25:00.180]  Yes, I hope that you didn't think
[04:25:01.140 --> 04:25:04.460]  No, I don't think it's such a, I just, I do this all the time,
[04:25:04.460 --> 04:25:07.140]  because I mean with this book, I just think you guys,
[04:25:07.140 --> 04:25:09.100]  you don't know all the data, and if you just knew all the data,
[04:25:09.100 --> 04:25:11.340]  you'd see how I see it.
[04:25:11.340 --> 04:25:12.660]  That's what I'm thinking.
[04:25:12.660 --> 04:25:13.740]  It doesn't mean it's true.
[04:25:13.740 --> 04:25:15.300]  But it's important to me.
[04:25:15.300 --> 04:25:20.260]  And yeah, as what you do, and what I've committed myself to do,
[04:25:20.260 --> 04:25:22.660]  is I want you to understand what we're coming from.
[04:25:22.660 --> 04:25:24.260]  I don't want you to walk away like,
[04:25:24.260 --> 04:25:25.740]  I don't want to give a shit about the bigger problems.
[04:25:25.740 --> 04:25:26.900]  No, you do.
[04:25:26.900 --> 04:25:28.860]  But right now, you're in front of us.
[04:25:28.940 --> 04:25:29.780]  How do we help you out?
[04:25:29.780 --> 04:25:32.260]  Okay, thank you.
[04:25:32.260 --> 04:25:34.700]  And thank you again.
[04:25:34.700 --> 04:25:36.500]  And again, that's our opinion.
[04:25:36.500 --> 04:25:40.700]  So it's not legal, it's just my opinion.
[04:25:40.700 --> 04:25:41.540]  Cool.
[04:25:41.540 --> 04:25:44.260]  And yeah, sorry, I know what you're doing.
[04:25:44.260 --> 04:25:48.300]  I wasn't, yeah, can we just throw that out there?
[04:25:48.300 --> 04:25:50.500]  No, no, no, I just want to, sometimes,
[04:25:50.500 --> 04:25:52.380]  I think it's always better,
[04:25:52.380 --> 04:25:53.700]  and maybe this is a fault of mine,
[04:25:53.700 --> 04:25:55.700]  is to be more articulate and clear,
[04:25:55.700 --> 04:25:58.100]  and to clarify stuff, so that when we walk away,
[04:25:58.100 --> 04:26:02.140]  we're clear about what the perception was,
[04:26:02.140 --> 04:26:04.820]  or what the intent was, but not intent to accept.
[04:26:04.820 --> 04:26:06.780]  I know your intent, yeah, no, I trust your intent,
[04:26:06.780 --> 04:26:09.780]  absolutely, I do trust your intent, obviously.
[04:26:11.260 --> 04:26:13.180]  That, yeah, and I hope you trust mine.
[04:26:14.940 --> 04:26:16.180]  You can do something you can work on,
[04:26:16.180 --> 04:26:19.220]  if you need me, like I told you before,
[04:26:19.220 --> 04:26:20.500]  you know, if you can't do anything,
[04:26:20.500 --> 04:26:23.580]  and I've been through that before with Tim and Jan,
[04:26:23.580 --> 04:26:26.340]  and when they get stuck on some sort of bureaucratic thing,
[04:26:26.340 --> 04:26:29.460]  I'm still happy about it, so, appreciate that.
[04:26:30.780 --> 04:26:33.340]  Good deal, I think we got a good, good work and plan.
[04:26:34.340 --> 04:26:36.580]  Maybe, I mean, I'll even try to do some research
[04:26:36.580 --> 04:26:39.060]  on a lawyer for you, and give you some suggestions,
[04:26:39.060 --> 04:26:40.260]  or something like that, I don't know,
[04:26:40.260 --> 04:26:41.380]  we'll see what I can do.
[04:26:41.380 --> 04:26:44.220]  I don't know, just do the same research you can do,
[04:26:44.220 --> 04:26:46.700]  but at least I can give you a,
[04:26:46.700 --> 04:26:48.980]  okay, well, this looks good, that doesn't look good,
[04:26:48.980 --> 04:26:51.460]  but anyway, we'll go for that part first,
[04:26:51.460 --> 04:26:52.780]  and then if you find anything else,
[04:26:52.780 --> 04:26:55.340]  then you can tell us who would be good.
[04:26:55.340 --> 04:26:58.780]  I'll, can you do more specific with help with?
[04:26:58.780 --> 04:27:01.060]  Yeah, I mean, do you know what I'm doing now?
[04:27:01.060 --> 04:27:02.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:27:02.420 --> 04:27:04.060]  So, like, today was just to assess
[04:27:04.060 --> 04:27:06.940]  what kind of access you have, or what kind of skills you have.
[04:27:06.940 --> 04:27:08.780]  So what I'll do is I'll write this up and ask around,
[04:27:08.780 --> 04:27:10.300]  like maybe there's someone who might call a crime
[04:27:10.300 --> 04:27:12.900]  who has, you know, a need for something
[04:27:12.900 --> 04:27:14.940]  that you can help with, and then I'll find them and say,
[04:27:14.940 --> 04:27:15.940]  hey, this is what he's got,
[04:27:15.940 --> 04:27:18.020]  this is the skills he has, this is the access he has.
[04:27:18.020 --> 04:27:20.180]  That's all based on what we've said today.
[04:27:20.180 --> 04:27:21.220]  That's why if there's anything else
[04:27:21.220 --> 04:27:23.700]  that you have access to, or crimes that you're aware of,
[04:27:23.700 --> 04:27:25.140]  all those things are useful,
[04:27:25.140 --> 04:27:27.060]  because then we can use that to say,
[04:27:27.060 --> 04:27:28.700]  okay, this person can use you to this person.
[04:27:28.700 --> 04:27:29.540]  Oh, okay.
[04:27:29.540 --> 04:27:30.380]  Does that make sense?
[04:27:30.380 --> 04:27:31.220]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[04:27:31.220 --> 04:27:33.340]  Right now, we're just the gatekeepers
[04:27:33.340 --> 04:27:35.980]  of your information, like, you give us the information,
[04:27:35.980 --> 04:27:37.780]  we send it out to other bureau people,
[04:27:37.780 --> 04:27:39.620]  because we can't have 800 people in the room right now.
[04:27:39.620 --> 04:27:41.460]  Right, right, so it's a placement.
[04:27:41.460 --> 04:27:42.300]  That's right, okay.
[04:27:42.300 --> 04:27:43.140]  Okay, yeah.
[04:27:43.140 --> 04:27:44.100]  That's the whole reason we're here,
[04:27:44.100 --> 04:27:46.220]  is just to see what you can provide us
[04:27:46.220 --> 04:27:48.100]  so that we can help you, make sense.
[04:27:48.100 --> 04:27:51.700]  Okay, I will be putting a list of journalism.
[04:27:51.700 --> 04:27:52.540]  Right.
[04:27:52.900 --> 04:27:54.180]  Any questions you can always give?
[04:27:54.180 --> 04:27:55.540]  Don't get to anybody.
[04:27:55.540 --> 04:27:59.660]  And I can, I'm not, I can't get anything,
[04:27:59.660 --> 04:28:02.140]  but I can get a pretty good amount of data.
[04:28:03.500 --> 04:28:05.220]  And it would be a more specific ask, too.
[04:28:05.220 --> 04:28:07.300]  We would say, okay, hey, do you know
[04:28:07.300 --> 04:28:10.260]  next person at the Miami Herald or something like that?
[04:28:10.260 --> 04:28:11.500]  What do you know about them?
[04:28:11.500 --> 04:28:12.340]  And that would be someone else,
[04:28:12.340 --> 04:28:13.180]  but wouldn't it be me?
[04:28:13.180 --> 04:28:14.780]  Probably someone out of Miami, right?
[04:28:14.780 --> 04:28:17.540]  So, anyway, we're gonna take all this stuff
[04:28:17.540 --> 04:28:20.740]  and digest it, hopefully we can help you out at the same time.
[04:28:20.740 --> 04:28:21.580]  But if you have any questions,
[04:28:21.580 --> 04:28:25.140]  you can always give me a call or, you know,
[04:28:25.140 --> 04:28:28.060]  so these guys are in LA, and I'm obviously in Houston,
[04:28:28.060 --> 04:28:31.060]  but you know, either way, we can help you out, okay?
[04:28:31.060 --> 04:28:34.580]  Okay, are you not gonna be an LA person?
[04:28:34.580 --> 04:28:35.420]  No.
[04:28:35.420 --> 04:28:36.340]  You're gonna be a Houston person.
[04:28:36.340 --> 04:28:37.620]  I'm a Houston person, okay.
[04:28:37.620 --> 04:28:39.500]  Yeah, so if anything develops,
[04:28:39.500 --> 04:28:41.220]  you'll probably be having an idea.
[04:28:41.220 --> 04:28:42.900]  Yeah, you're okay.
[04:28:42.900 --> 04:28:46.620]  Okay, so you just came out here to discuss me.
[04:28:46.620 --> 04:28:48.620]  Cool, man, thank you.
[04:28:48.620 --> 04:28:50.180]  Glad to, thank you, kind of.
[04:28:50.300 --> 04:28:51.900]  You can come all the way down there, right?
[04:28:51.900 --> 04:28:52.740]  Yeah.
[04:28:53.740 --> 04:28:55.300]  Oh, cool, I hope.
[04:28:55.300 --> 04:28:56.860]  And I can't fill in there, right?
[04:28:56.860 --> 04:28:57.700]  Yeah, please don't, yeah.
[04:28:57.700 --> 04:28:59.940]  Not even that you had a being, or that you...
[04:28:59.940 --> 04:29:01.020]  You live in Auburn, you know?
[04:29:01.020 --> 04:29:01.860]  Is she okay?
[04:29:01.860 --> 04:29:02.700]  Yeah, I don't know.
[04:29:02.700 --> 04:29:03.700]  Auburn, obviously, knows you being there.
[04:29:03.700 --> 04:29:05.740]  So, I don't know if I've seen her, but...
[04:29:05.740 --> 04:29:06.700]  I wouldn't tell her anything,
[04:29:06.700 --> 04:29:08.620]  but if I were to talk about it,
[04:29:08.620 --> 04:29:09.940]  or if she's told us...
[04:29:09.940 --> 04:29:11.700]  You're not even going to talk about it.
[04:29:11.700 --> 04:29:13.660]  You're not even going to talk about it, I mean...
[04:29:13.660 --> 04:29:15.580]  I think anyone who's seen me,
[04:29:15.580 --> 04:29:17.900]  personally, better, I'd be talking to her in 21.
[04:29:17.900 --> 04:29:18.740]  That'd be great.
[04:29:18.740 --> 04:29:21.180]  You'd be talking to her in 23.
[04:29:21.180 --> 04:29:22.020]  Not funny.
[04:29:22.020 --> 04:29:23.740]  Yeah, I would never hear you talking to her.
[04:29:23.740 --> 04:29:24.740]  You'd be talking to her all the time.
[04:29:24.740 --> 04:29:25.580]  I'd play to her.
[04:29:25.580 --> 04:29:26.620]  No, she'd play to her.
[04:29:26.620 --> 04:29:28.020]  She would.
[04:29:28.020 --> 04:29:29.820]  Is she around today?
[04:29:29.820 --> 04:29:30.780]  Yeah.
[04:29:30.780 --> 04:29:32.580]  I can play by...
[04:29:32.580 --> 04:29:33.900]  I don't know, I could still talk to her a lot.
[04:29:33.900 --> 04:29:35.020]  You could play by.
[04:29:35.020 --> 04:29:36.460]  Talk to her real quick, she'd talk to her.
[04:29:36.460 --> 04:29:37.900]  You want to come by the class?
[04:29:37.900 --> 04:29:39.020]  Yeah, I know, yeah.
[04:29:39.020 --> 04:29:39.860]  We've got an hour.
[04:29:39.860 --> 04:29:40.700]  Well, let's see.
[04:29:40.700 --> 04:29:41.540]  Let me call her.
[04:29:41.540 --> 04:29:43.540]  She should be getting out of work.
[04:29:43.540 --> 04:29:45.500]  She'd be done by Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
[04:29:45.500 --> 04:29:47.340]  Yeah, she'd send me a text to whatever.
[04:29:47.340 --> 04:29:48.900]  I'd love to hear from her.
[04:29:48.900 --> 04:29:49.740]  Sure.
[04:29:49.740 --> 04:29:50.580]  She'd be on the run.
[04:29:50.580 --> 04:29:53.580]  She was kind of, you know, having to...
[04:29:53.580 --> 04:29:55.420]  She'd be on the run.
[04:29:55.420 --> 04:29:56.420]  She'd be down to the head.
[04:29:56.420 --> 04:29:57.740]  She'd be on the run.
[04:29:57.740 --> 04:29:58.580]  Really?
[04:29:58.580 --> 04:30:00.420]  Oh, yeah.
[04:30:00.420 --> 04:30:01.420]  Right.
[04:30:01.420 --> 04:30:03.420]  Yeah.
[04:30:03.420 --> 04:30:04.420]  I'd be on the run.
[04:30:04.420 --> 04:30:05.420]  Is that it?
[04:30:05.420 --> 04:30:06.420]  I'd be on the run.
[04:30:06.420 --> 04:30:07.420]  I'd be on the run.
