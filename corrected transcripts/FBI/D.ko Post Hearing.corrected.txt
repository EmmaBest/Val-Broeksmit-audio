[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  Val: but uh...
[00:01.920 --> 00:05.000]  Val: i don't know maybe we just have a bad lawyer
[00:05.000 --> 00:08.460]  Val:  but i don't know that means being that made me think of you know because
[00:08.460 --> 00:10.280]  Val: if you can get this thing just
[00:10.280 --> 00:14.520]  Val: to go away drop whatever you can save us some money with this lawyer
[00:14.520 --> 00:15.960]  Val: in the in the energy
[00:15.960 --> 00:17.000]  Val: and misery
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.880]  Val: i don't like lawyers
[00:18.880 --> 00:19.480]  Ko: right uh...
[00:19.480 --> 00:21.440]  Ko: neither do I if that makes you feel any better
[00:21.440 --> 00:24.000]  Val: it doesn't
Ko: I've had to deal with the fair amount of them unfortunately
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.240]  Val: yeah it's no fun
[00:26.240 --> 00:28.640]  Ko: i hear you man
[00:28.640 --> 00:32.720]  Ko: uh... i am looking into a couple things uh...
[00:32.720 --> 00:38.400]  Ko: so uh... to answer your question uh... you said you wanted to talk to uh... your lawyer mike
[00:38.400 --> 00:40.080]  Val: yeah
[00:40.080 --> 00:42.640]  Ko: what would it be that you'd want to tell them
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.800]  Val: well i think it would be great to
[00:44.800 --> 00:47.000]  Val: tell him that uh...
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.880]  Val: like he says that basically what we decided after speaking with you is that uh...
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.120]  Val: and you know what i fucked up after so all my life i thought erroneous meant
[00:56.120 --> 00:57.600]  Val: uh... arbitrary
[00:57.600 --> 01:00.160]  Val: i guess erroneous means wrong, inaccurate
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.640]  Val: so uh... so sabba's uh... this woman's testimony this ridiculous thing she
[01:04.640 --> 01:05.800]  Val: put together
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.120]  Val: uh... it's very bizarre as everyone is said including the judge
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.240]  Ko: uh... you there
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.720]  Val: yeah
[01:12.720 --> 01:14.120]  Val: oh no can you hear me now
[01:14.120 --> 01:16.240]  Val: how about this
[01:16.240 --> 01:19.040]  Ko: uh... about the sabba's erroneous uh... report
[01:19.040 --> 01:24.040]  Val: right right she's saying that now the erroneous uh... the fbis uh... report was
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.640]  Val: erroneous
[01:25.640 --> 01:30.240]  Val: this is what he said and he we need so he needs uh... tim and jammy
[01:30.240 --> 01:32.560]  Val: and you since you spoke to uh...
[01:32.560 --> 01:35.960]  Val: you know tim and jammy could i guess verify or vouch
[01:35.960 --> 01:38.240]  Val: uh... is you are not the guy
[01:38.240 --> 01:40.800]  Val: uh... you did not speak to sabba
[01:40.800 --> 01:42.160]  Val: and uh...
[01:42.160 --> 01:44.440]  Ko: Sorry this is a little bit maybe
[01:44.440 --> 01:46.400]  Ko: i'm not sure it's my connection or
[01:46.400 --> 01:47.400]  Val: i don't know
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.680]  Ko: mine i'm driving so
[01:48.680 --> 01:50.000]  Val: oh you're driving
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.680]  Ko: uh... you were saying tim and jammy's
[01:54.600 --> 01:58.920]  Val: yes so tim so as we figured out last night uh... tim never spoke to sabba
[01:58.920 --> 01:59.520]  Val: okay
[01:59.520 --> 02:03.080]  Val: so she wrote and she wrote down that she directly spoke to tim
[02:03.080 --> 02:04.040]  Val: uh...
[02:04.040 --> 02:06.800]  Val: so that's a problem that's erroneous and that's it
[02:06.800 --> 02:07.440]  Val: that's it
[02:07.440 --> 02:10.920]  Ko: i don't know if she did or not
[02:10.920 --> 02:13.240]  Ko: i don't know if she talked to tim
[02:13.240 --> 02:15.000]  Ko: i know that i've never talked to him
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.440]  Val: that you never... right you're the one that
[02:17.440 --> 02:20.080]  Val: right this is as long as you tell him you never speak spoke to any of these
[02:20.080 --> 02:21.840]  Val: people that'd be great
[02:21.840 --> 02:24.200]  Val: uh... maybe ask him what you could
[02:24.200 --> 02:29.040]  Val: if there's what does he need what could he do to help to have this go away now
[02:29.040 --> 02:32.880]  Val: uh... and suss him out i mean you've spoken with more lawyers and i probably have
[02:32.880 --> 02:36.560]  Val: does this guy want money is this guy trying to drag this thing out to get more money
[02:36.560 --> 02:38.720]  Val: or is he uh...
[02:38.720 --> 02:41.160]  Val: a good lawyer i don't know what do you think
[02:41.160 --> 02:45.680]  Val: uh... and then also like he's trying to call jim and timmy to get them to say
[02:45.680 --> 02:49.440]  Val: we never spoke with sabba this is uh... someone made this shit up
[02:49.440 --> 02:52.640]  Val: and had he done that i think this morning and jim and timmy had picked up the
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.400]  Val: phone
[02:53.400 --> 02:59.840]  Val: i don't think there'd be a case
[02:59.840 --> 03:02.840]  Ko: Ok let me say this
[03:02.840 --> 03:06.240]  Ko: remember what we talked about at first was that we need to keep
[03:06.240 --> 03:09.320]  Ko: specifically my involvement
[03:09.320 --> 03:12.560]  Val: and i haven't told anybody
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.640]  Ko: and i didn't think you would but the thing is if i tell your lawyer
[03:16.640 --> 03:19.280]  Ko: your lawyer is also under no obligation to
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.640]  Ko: not put my name everywhere and put in court documents that are publicly available
[03:23.640 --> 03:24.800]  Ko: and things like that
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.680]  Ko: so that's what we have to be careful on how we want to address it
[03:28.680 --> 03:32.760]  Ko: uh... more than likely what i would do since he already talked to tim
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.720]  Ko: i may have tim talk to him on my behalf or something like that or clarify
[03:36.720 --> 03:38.560]  Ko: something
[03:38.560 --> 03:40.840]  Ko: because tim's investigation is already
[03:40.840 --> 03:45.520]  Ko: what it is and there's articles written about it in New York Times or whatever right now
[03:45.520 --> 03:46.520]  Ko: so there's nothing
[03:46.520 --> 03:48.920]  Ko: covert about what tim's doing
[03:48.920 --> 03:50.320]  Ko: if i call him and i say hey
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.440]  Ko: my name is david and i've never talked to this lady sabba and he's gonna be like
[03:53.440 --> 03:55.200]  Ko: well who the hell are you
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.440]  Ko: i'll say well i'm the agent of houston and like well why is he talking, why are you talking about?
[03:59.440 --> 04:01.800]  Ko: and then he's like well you know
[04:01.800 --> 04:03.400]  Ko: it leads down a lot of
[04:03.400 --> 04:04.400]  Val: of course
[04:04.400 --> 04:05.800]  Ko: roads we don't want to go down
[04:05.800 --> 04:11.040]  Val: i'm just going off the plateau we hit last night when he said give me the
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.000]  Val: lawyer's number and perhaps you could call him if you come up with an idea so i thought
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.760]  Val: this would be a good chance
[04:18.760 --> 04:22.000]  Ko: uh... also i never got the lawyer's number
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.600]  Ko: either i didn't write it down but usually if he tells me i write it maybe i said it and
[04:26.600 --> 04:27.320]  Ko: he kind of like
[04:27.320 --> 04:29.120]  Val: oh no 
Ko: i never got it
[04:29.120 --> 04:30.520]  Val: i texted it to you
[04:30.520 --> 04:32.320]  Val: did you not receive the text yeah
[04:32.320 --> 04:33.320]  Val: oh no
[04:33.320 --> 04:35.320]  Ko: let me check my text
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.000]  Ko: i just picked my notes but i didn't see it
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.880]  Ko: but uh... i'll double check my text again
[04:39.880 --> 04:42.960]  Val: yeah that would be a big problem if you're not getting these texts then they're going
[04:42.960 --> 04:44.960]  Val: to somebody else and that's not good i've got you
[04:44.960 --> 04:47.160]  Val: right here i'm talking to you now
[04:47.160 --> 04:49.000]  Val: and i've texted it to
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Val: uh... let me just double check
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.120]  Val: two eight one
[04:53.120 --> 04:56.400]  Val: two eight one four one four six two three three
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.400]  Val: yeah that's it
[04:57.400 --> 04:58.640]  Val: okay good
[04:58.640 --> 05:02.800]  Val: and by the way the uh...
[05:02.800 --> 05:07.920]  Val: congratulations on congressional medal of bravery that's amazing
[05:07.920 --> 05:08.920]  Val: it's very amazing
[05:08.920 --> 05:11.480]  Ko: yeah unfortunately that's all out there yeah i know
[05:11.480 --> 05:13.480]  Val: pretty cool though man pretty cool
[05:13.480 --> 05:15.360]  Val: i felt a lot more confident when i read that
[05:15.360 --> 05:16.920]  Val: very good
[05:16.920 --> 05:18.800]  Val: top marks for you
[05:18.800 --> 05:22.680]  Ko: that was something that we didn't really deserve to get we're just doing our job and there's
[05:22.680 --> 05:23.920]  Ko: lots of other people who did
[05:23.920 --> 05:26.120]  Ko: a lot more than i did i'll tell you that right now
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.280]  Val: yeah well said
[05:27.280 --> 05:28.760]  Val: good answer
[05:28.760 --> 05:30.000]  Val: good answer
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.960]  Val: um but yeah okay
[05:31.960 --> 05:33.760]  Val: yeah please let me know
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.080]  Ko: yeah i'll double check some stuff i'm still doing some things so
[05:37.080 --> 05:38.080]  Ko: like i said what
[05:38.080 --> 05:40.400]  Ko: i'll probably come up with is
[05:40.400 --> 05:45.800]  Ko: i'll have to find out what it is that we need to do to resolve the court situation
[05:45.800 --> 05:48.240]  Ko: which unfortunately is not an easy list
[05:48.240 --> 05:51.240]  Ko: just from my, i don't know, the day of
[05:51.240 --> 05:53.920]  Ko: digging around and trying to figure things out
[05:53.920 --> 05:56.280]  Ko: uh... it's not going to be something that's going to be resolved overnight
[05:56.280 --> 05:57.280]  Val: i know
[05:57.280 --> 05:59.240]  Ko: i can only be honest with you
[05:59.240 --> 06:02.680]  Ko: right i can't promise you the world if i can't give it to you
[06:02.680 --> 06:05.800]  Val: sure and i appreciate that
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.120]  Ko: and uh... so right now i'm looking at things trying to figure out what
[06:09.120 --> 06:11.360]  Ko: uh... what our best
[06:11.360 --> 06:12.880]  Ko: get so to speak
[06:12.880 --> 06:13.720]  Val: uh...
[06:13.720 --> 06:15.160]  Val: did you know
[06:15.160 --> 06:18.640]  Val: did you know there's no due process in this court system this this dependency
[06:18.640 --> 06:20.400]  Val: court in this dcv
[06:20.400 --> 06:24.640]  Ko: yeah it's a civil process which is different than a criminal process
[06:24.640 --> 06:27.040]  Ko: uh... so criminal processes you know
[06:27.040 --> 06:30.320]  Ko: it's beyond a reasonable doubt and that's the standard for conviction
[06:30.320 --> 06:32.560]  Ko: civil court cases it's uh...
[06:32.560 --> 06:35.040]  Ko: preponderance of the evidence i believe so
[06:35.040 --> 06:36.360]  Val: well but there was no evidence
[06:36.360 --> 06:39.640]  Val: you can go now you can actually go in with pure hearsay and this is what the
[06:39.640 --> 06:44.080]  Val: lawyer just just prove to us pure hearsay the neighbors can go say yes uh...
[06:44.080 --> 06:48.440]  Val: you know uh... these guys are these guys are shaving chipmunks every you know
[06:48.440 --> 06:51.000]  Val: that's what they do they shave chipmunks and they sell the hair
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.080]  Val: and then there's no proof for evidence but they have to accept that as fact
[06:55.080 --> 06:57.480]  Val: the judge has to accept it as fact
[06:57.480 --> 06:58.800]  Val: or as true
[06:58.800 --> 06:59.520]  Ko: i don't think
[06:59.520 --> 07:02.440]  Ko: well i don't think they have to accept it as fact but
[07:02.760 --> 07:06.440]  Ko: the standard for evidence is a lot looser i know what you mean
[07:06.440 --> 07:09.800]  Ko: in other words it just doesn't have to believe that that's true because obviously
[07:09.800 --> 07:11.240]  Ko: you've got all sorts like
[07:11.240 --> 07:13.880]  Ko: unfortunately like i said i've dealt with this before
[07:13.880 --> 07:17.320]  Ko: you know crazy ex-spouses claim all sorts of stupid shit
[07:17.320 --> 07:18.280]  Ko: and
[07:18.280 --> 07:20.440]  Ko: luckily for the most part
[07:20.440 --> 07:22.680]  Ko: uh... we can kind of cut through some of the bullshit
[07:22.680 --> 07:24.600]  Ko: but
[07:24.600 --> 07:28.760]  Ko: but what we'll talk about on wednesday is just trying to figure out if there's
[07:28.760 --> 07:31.400]  Ko: you know anything else that we should know about
[07:31.400 --> 07:33.160]  Ko: you know when we go and talk to them because
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.080]  Ko: i don't want to look like a chapped ass if
[07:35.080 --> 07:35.560]  Ko: you know
[07:35.560 --> 07:37.880]  Ko: if we put our neck out on the line and say hey
[07:37.880 --> 07:38.600]  Ko: you know
[07:38.600 --> 07:40.680]  Ko: this is this is we know that Val
[07:40.680 --> 07:43.560]  Ko: guy and he's not a serial killer and turns out you know okay i got
[07:43.560 --> 07:45.240]  Ko: 10 chopped up kids in the back truck you know
[07:45.240 --> 07:47.240]  Val: yeah yeah i got you
[07:47.240 --> 07:48.120]  Val: of course yeah
[07:48.120 --> 07:51.640]  Ko: so uh but that's why on on wednesday we're gonna talk a little bit more
[07:51.640 --> 07:52.680]  Ko: depth about that
[07:52.680 --> 07:53.480]  Ko: about
[07:53.480 --> 07:55.000]  Ko: what you can tell us because
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.960]  Ko: you know the thing the other reason i uh is Marie room right now
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.960]  Val: uh yes

[10:25.000 --> 10:29.880]  Val: and uh that's my bad that's my bad
[10:35.560 --> 10:39.880]  Val: yeah
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.400]  Val: that's what i figured yeah that's what i figured i'll have to give her a
[10:45.400 --> 10:49.400]  Val: different story though um i'm really bad at lying to her i can lie
[10:49.400 --> 10:53.160]  Val: really well to everyone else but not to her i so i have to figure out
[10:53.160 --> 10:59.400]  Val: half-truth
[10:59.400 --> 11:05.400]  yeah
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.400]  that'd be great
[11:19.400 --> 11:23.400]  Ko: i'm gonna even give Marie my number as well
[11:36.840 --> 11:41.080]  Ko: ...eliminate any mistrust between you and her.... 
Val: sure that's great that's very polite yes let's do that
[11:41.080 --> 11:47.400]  Val: that's a good idea
[11:49.880 --> 11:53.400]  Val: understood completely yes
[11:58.840 --> 12:01.400]  Val: okay
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.560]  Val: yeah well
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.120]  Val: september 29th is the next hearing um there's gonna be an
[12:12.120 --> 12:15.560]  Val: investigator assigned to our case and he's gonna investigate us
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.080]  Val: um they've already spoken with marlowe and marlowe loves me and he keeps telling
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.880]  him how much they love me so that's the good news and then to steve's chagrin he
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.280]  does not like to hear that at all um but it's really nice it was really nice
[12:28.280 --> 12:31.720]  to hear the psychiatrist say marlowe just loves val
[12:31.720 --> 12:37.000]  um so that's really good and then and there's uh uh what else is there
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.240]  so the so the judge i can't see or talk to marlowe until
[12:43.240 --> 12:46.920]  i get special permission from the judge or the hearing that's pissing me off
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.680]  that's like horrible and the thing that's five weeks from now
[12:51.240 --> 12:55.000]  i'm not allowed to speak because of the allegations i'm not allowed to speak
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  to marlowe or even see him on the court well marie's allowed to see him three
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.680]  times a week i can't even see him i can't even talk to him on the phone
[13:02.680 --> 13:08.440]  i know i know it's not nice it's we're crying it was terrible it was just
[13:08.440 --> 13:19.960]  terrible
Ko: We'll do our best to see what we can do ... resolving that.
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.960]  Val: and uh yeah she or he will deliver a report of some sort and uh the the report
[13:33.960 --> 13:37.880]  will go to the judge and then the hearing will be based on that report the next
[13:37.960 --> 13:51.400]  step yeah
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.400]  Ko: okay
[14:03.400 --> 14:06.920]  Val: sure right
Ko: Best bet is to work with the investigator to show responsible parents... report... nothing derogatory....
[14:24.840 --> 14:29.720]  Val: yeah it is yeah it's exactly what they told what the our lawyer told the judge
[14:29.720 --> 14:33.160]  and but the judge i was so frustrated to hear the judge has to take that
[14:33.960 --> 14:39.640]  by law has to accept that report and that's and they must have known that shaba and the
[14:39.640 --> 14:43.880]  others must have known that which is why they made it so severe i mean i do you still do you
[14:43.880 --> 14:50.200]  mean to send i was i'm happy to send it to you but keep in mind it is ridiculous okay i just
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.280]  worry i'm gonna be judged by this report that's why i'm afraid to show it to anyone because it's
[14:54.280 --> 15:05.640]  so absurd um like like it's yeah it's it's yeah because you you seem like a clever guy
[15:05.640 --> 15:10.040]  and you have that clever look on your face i saw in that photo and i said to marie "oh
[15:10.040 --> 15:18.440]  shit he's smart" [laughs] when i saw your photo i getting the metal and i saw versus well compared to the
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.680]  other guys the other three guys and i said the marie oh shit "this guy's smart"
[15:27.960 --> 15:36.360]  yeah no no no no i can tell you no i can tell you are sorry but i just want you so you can you
[15:36.360 --> 15:41.480]  can read between the lines and you'll see that the you'll see i won't taint it for you by telling

[18:41.880 --> 18:46.600]  okay this is all set up because val talks too much and how are we going to keep val quiet and
[18:46.600 --> 18:52.040]  work for us at the same time let's get marlowe in trouble let's have marlowe's uh thing at stake
[18:52.040 --> 18:55.960]  and then we'll have val come in and then he will shut up he won't talk to anybody and he'll do what
[18:55.960 --> 19:00.440]  we say but that was just a paranoid thought but of course i have to have it just rule it out
[19:00.440 --> 19:05.880]  but i don't believe that's what's happening so don't worry don't worry about it but you know
[19:05.880 --> 19:10.920]  i mean like i have to go i have to go through the whole gambit of possibilities after you know
