[00:00.000 --> 00:04.920]  Goldman: really just pull them out and they speak for themselves.
[00:04.920 --> 00:08.840]  Val: Well, let me give you an example of what I'm concerned about.
[00:08.840 --> 00:14.320]  Val: Like, my father in one email is talking to DBTCA,
[00:14.320 --> 00:18.240]  Val: someone on the board, and says, why are you sending me this?
[00:18.240 --> 00:21.760]  Val: I'm technically a freelance independent contractor.
[00:21.760 --> 00:23.880]  Val: So I should not be getting this.
[00:23.880 --> 00:24.640]  Val: What are you thinking?
[00:24.640 --> 00:26.000]  Val: What are you doing?
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.840]  Val: And the response is, oh, apologies.
[00:28.840 --> 00:31.360]  Val: Let me send it up the chain, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31.360 --> 00:33.720]  Val: So someone looks at that, and they say, well, Bill Broeksmit
[00:33.720 --> 00:36.320]  Val: is getting these documents illegally.
[00:36.320 --> 00:37.400]  Val: He's a freelance independent.
[00:37.400 --> 00:40.120]  Val: He's making it known that he's a freelance independent contractor
[00:40.120 --> 00:41.200]  Val: at this point.
[00:41.200 --> 00:44.240]  Val: So these people are sending him yet he looks at this work,
[00:44.240 --> 00:47.120]  Val: and he does work on this particular project
[00:47.120 --> 00:48.200]  Val: in an illegal fashion.
[00:48.200 --> 00:50.080]  Val: Why is he doing this?
[00:50.080 --> 00:52.400]  Val: I mean, something like that, it's so silly and stupid,
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.560]  Val: but little things like that can be taken really far out
[00:54.560 --> 00:55.600]  Val: of context.
[00:55.600 --> 00:58.240]  Val: And then someone in your office is like, oh, well, Bill Broeksmit
[00:58.240 --> 01:02.400]  Val: was technically a freelance independent contractor,
[01:02.400 --> 01:05.040]  Val: but a board member at the same time, how can that be possible?
[01:05.040 --> 01:07.800]  Val: Let's look into his relationship with Anchu.
[01:07.800 --> 01:08.720]  Val: Why is Anchu?
[01:08.720 --> 01:10.480]  Val: I mean, it could just go anywhere.
[01:10.480 --> 01:12.080]  Val: I mean, it's limitless how things
[01:12.080 --> 01:13.320]  Val: can be taken out of context.
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.120]  Val: So I think it's a little naive to say
[01:15.120 --> 01:17.840]  Val: that they speak for themselves.
[01:17.840 --> 01:20.560]  Goldman: Right, but when you, look, I haven't seen it,
[01:20.560 --> 01:23.160]  Goldman: but when you, and I don't know the exact story,
[01:23.160 --> 01:24.840]  Goldman: but as you just described it to me,
[01:24.840 --> 01:29.000]  Goldman: my reaction is the board member who sent it to your dad
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.720]  Goldman: was doing the wrong thing, not your dad.
[01:31.720 --> 01:33.680]  Val: Right, no, I know that's your reaction,
[01:33.680 --> 01:37.120]  Val: but someone else with some other political agenda
[01:37.120 --> 01:39.520]  Val: could spin that any way they want.
[01:39.520 --> 01:41.440]  Val: I mean, I know, I mean, it's a risk that I'm taking,
[01:41.440 --> 01:44.600]  Val: and I get that, and I'm happy to take that risk,
[01:44.600 --> 01:48.720]  Val: but only to a limit, you know, Dan, it just worries me.
[01:48.720 --> 01:51.240]  Val: It really worries me that I'm gonna be the one,
[01:51.240 --> 01:54.560]  Val: like I'm spending all this four years learning finance,
[01:54.560 --> 01:55.960]  Val: getting involved with this ridiculous,
[01:55.960 --> 02:00.000]  Val: crazy political shit, and finance in New York Times
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.520]  Val: to keep my father's name like solid,
[02:02.520 --> 02:05.040]  Val: and then I'd sink it all, and then I'd ruin it all
[02:05.040 --> 02:06.800]  Val: and blow it all up just by handing it over
[02:06.800 --> 02:08.920]  Val: to some people that use it for their own needs
[02:08.920 --> 02:10.360]  Val: because I didn't do my homework,
[02:10.360 --> 02:12.480]  Val: and I didn't, and I didn't vet everybody,
[02:12.480 --> 02:14.720]  Val: and I didn't, and I didn't, and I fucked it up,
[02:14.720 --> 02:17.560]  Val: and I don't wanna be the one that fucks this up.
[02:17.560 --> 02:19.560]  Val: So I wanna, I wanna, do you know what I mean?
[02:19.560 --> 02:21.600]  Goldman: I totally hear that, but let me, let me
[02:21.640 --> 02:24.680]  Goldman: propose to you something else, you know,
[02:24.680 --> 02:29.680]  Goldman: is the our president has been unbelievably secretive
[02:30.480 --> 02:35.480]  Goldman: about his finances, and he is then on the flip side of it,
[02:38.320 --> 02:41.120]  Goldman: you know, having private one-on-one meetings
[02:41.120 --> 02:46.120]  Goldman: with Vladimir Putin, he doesn't punish the Saudis
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.240]  Goldman: after they murder, you know, a green card holder,
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.920]  Goldman: Jamal Khashoggi, because they give a lot of money,
[02:53.920 --> 02:55.200]  Goldman: you know, they invest a lot of money
[02:55.200 --> 02:57.080]  Goldman: in the Trump Organization.
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.080]  Goldman: Like, this is a guy who is really, really doing damage
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.280]  Goldman: to our nation, and both domestically and abroad,
[03:08.280 --> 03:13.160]  Goldman: and imagine a scenario where, you know,
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.240]  Goldman: some of the material that you have
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.240]  Goldman: can actually sort of provide the seed
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.680]  Goldman: that we can then use to blow open, you know,
[03:26.680 --> 03:28.880]  Goldman: everything that he's been hiding.
[03:28.880 --> 03:31.680]  Goldman: Like, in some respects, you know,
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.240]  Goldman: you and your father vicariously through you
[03:35.240 --> 03:40.240]  Goldman: will go down in American history as a hero,
[03:40.720 --> 03:45.720]  Goldman: and as the person who really broke open
[03:45.720 --> 03:50.720]  Goldman: an incredibly corrupt president and administration.
[03:50.960 --> 03:53.880]  Goldman: So I recognize your focus on the downside.
[03:53.880 --> 03:56.200]  Goldman: I choose to focus on the upside,
[03:56.200 --> 04:00.640]  Goldman: which is from the way you describe this information,
[04:00.640 --> 04:03.880]  Goldman: and from what David said today, and, you know,
[04:03.880 --> 04:08.160]  Goldman: it sounds like it can be really helpful to our investigation,
[04:08.160 --> 04:11.120]  Goldman: and the problem with congressional investigations,
[04:11.120 --> 04:16.040]  Goldman: which is different than the FBI and the prosecutors,
[04:16.040 --> 04:21.040]  Goldman: is we, in Congress, you sort of need to have
[04:21.440 --> 04:25.320]  Goldman: a foundation to continue to investigate.
[04:25.320 --> 04:30.320]  Goldman: And if we are able to get some of these materials,
[04:30.400 --> 04:32.760]  Goldman: they can really be the building block
[04:32.760 --> 04:36.600]  Goldman: that we can then expand our investigation.
[04:36.600 --> 04:39.280]  Goldman: So it could be incredibly helpful to us,
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.880]  Goldman: even if we ultimately get the documents
[04:43.880 --> 04:45.860]  Goldman: from another source, you know,
[04:45.860 --> 04:48.240]  Goldman: which is entirely possible down the road,
[04:48.240 --> 04:50.560]  Goldman: if we are able to, you know,
[04:50.560 --> 04:53.800]  Goldman: get documents directly from Deutsche Bank.
[04:53.800 --> 04:56.280]  Goldman: But it's, you know, it's also possible
[04:56.280 --> 04:59.480]  Goldman: they might have erased them or destroyed them, you know,
[04:59.480 --> 05:00.440]  Goldman: who knows, so.
[05:00.440 --> 05:02.800]  Val: I would love if you could get them from Deutsche Bank, man.
[05:02.800 --> 05:04.320]  Val: That'd be great.
[05:04.320 --> 05:09.240]  Goldman: But we need, but it's hard because it's more difficult
[05:09.240 --> 05:12.320]  Goldman: in some ways in Congress than it is for, you know,
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.520]  Goldman: the prosecutor.
[05:13.520 --> 05:15.040]  Goldman: I mean, you should tell the FBI,
[05:15.040 --> 05:17.200]  Goldman: they should just go give a grand jury subpoena
[05:17.200 --> 05:20.440]  Goldman: to Deutsche Bank and ask for all these emails.
[05:20.440 --> 05:22.840]  Goldman: They can do it more easily than we can.
[05:22.840 --> 05:23.680]  Goldman: So.
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.000]  Val: Yeah, I'm sure they consider that too,
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.680]  Val: but I don't know, they're coming to me.
[05:26.680 --> 05:28.560]  Val: I don't know exactly what they want.
[05:28.560 --> 05:30.400]  Val: But again, I don't think I told you,
[05:30.400 --> 05:33.640]  Val: but Tim Lucy's coming out tomorrow.
[05:33.640 --> 05:35.840]  Val: So I have another meeting with them tomorrow.
[05:37.120 --> 05:38.840]  Val: But look, man, you're a good salesman, Dan.
[05:38.840 --> 05:39.880]  Val: I mean, I know that'd be great.
[05:39.880 --> 05:41.600]  Val: My dad was the hero, of course.
[05:41.600 --> 05:44.280]  Val: I mean, that would be the, you know,
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.520]  Val: exactly what I want as you know.
[05:46.520 --> 05:49.320]  Val: But I mean, honestly, I don't think I have documents
[05:49.320 --> 05:51.280]  Val: that are gonna really destroy Trump directly.
[05:51.280 --> 05:54.240]  Val: I don't have a smoking gun, but I mean, I want to help.
[05:54.240 --> 05:58.200]  Goldman: No, and that's my point is, that's my point is,
[05:58.200 --> 06:00.000]  Goldman: I know you don't have a smoking gun,
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.880]  Goldman: but it sounds like your emails provide the seed
[06:03.880 --> 06:06.000]  Goldman: that we can then build upon.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.960]  Goldman: You know, the like initial building block
[06:08.960 --> 06:11.480]  Goldman: that we can then start to expand
[06:11.480 --> 06:14.560]  Goldman: and we've got a good foundation and a good basis
[06:17.440 --> 06:20.280]  Goldman: to be able to dig into this.
[06:20.280 --> 06:22.240]  Val: Sure, yeah, and I totally agree.
[06:22.240 --> 06:23.320]  Val: I'm totally with that.
[06:23.320 --> 06:25.320]  Val: So I think our interests are aligned.
[06:25.320 --> 06:26.160]  Val: I'm right with you.
[06:26.160 --> 06:27.400]  Val: I want to help.
[06:27.400 --> 06:31.600]  Val: I'm also enraged at this crazy fucker Trump.
[06:31.600 --> 06:32.920]  Val: And I want to do what I can.
[06:32.920 --> 06:35.760]  Val: But Dan, you gotta respect what I'm coming from.
[06:35.760 --> 06:38.000]  Val: Is that I just want some involvement here
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.040]  Val: and some oversight on my father's emails.
[06:40.040 --> 06:42.800]  Val: I don't want to be a part of your investigation.
[06:42.800 --> 06:44.480]  Val: I don't have to do anything else,
[06:44.480 --> 06:46.880]  Val: just some oversight in my father's emails.
[06:46.880 --> 06:48.600]  Val: I mean, you don't have to fly me to DC.
[06:48.600 --> 06:49.960]  Val: You can come out here.
[06:49.960 --> 06:52.720]  Val: You know, maybe we can find something over FaceTime
[06:52.720 --> 06:53.720]  Val: where we all just get together
[06:53.720 --> 06:56.800]  Val: and I show you stuff on Skype or something.
[06:56.800 --> 06:59.600]  Val: I mean, there's gotta be some way to do this
[06:59.600 --> 07:00.920]  Val: where we both-
[07:01.240 --> 07:03.160]  Goldman: I can promise you, Val,
[07:03.160 --> 07:05.680]  Goldman: that we will continue-
[07:05.680 --> 07:06.520]  Val: Compromise.
[07:06.520 --> 07:07.520]  Goldman: To communicate with you.
[07:09.120 --> 07:14.120]  Goldman: But, you know, we need the documents.
[07:14.560 --> 07:17.800]  Goldman: I mean, I did a securities fraud investigations
[07:17.800 --> 07:18.840]  Goldman: for three years.
[07:18.840 --> 07:22.920]  Goldman: I recently hired another former prosecutor
[07:22.920 --> 07:25.640]  Goldman: from the Southern District who was the chief
[07:25.640 --> 07:30.640]  Goldman: of the complex frauds unit in the Southern District.
[07:30.800 --> 07:32.680]  Goldman: You can vet him if you want.
[07:32.680 --> 07:34.360]  Goldman: His name is Dan Noble.
[07:34.360 --> 07:35.200]  Val: Yeah, I did.
[07:35.200 --> 07:36.040]  Val: I did.
[07:36.040 --> 07:37.280]  Val: I already looked him up.
[07:37.280 --> 07:38.120]  Goldman: Oh, yeah.
[07:38.120 --> 07:42.880]  Goldman: We are, you know, we're experienced financial investigators.
[07:42.880 --> 07:44.480]  Goldman: And so-
[07:44.480 --> 07:45.800]  Val: Yeah, no, David had only-
[07:45.800 --> 07:47.160]  Goldman: Maybe we all may have questions,
[07:47.160 --> 07:52.160]  Goldman: but I think we will be able to understand this.
[07:53.120 --> 07:58.120]  Goldman: We just hired a 25 year veteran of the FBI
[07:58.960 --> 08:03.960]  Goldman: who was the, who took on a very senior position
[08:05.600 --> 08:08.400]  Goldman: in the financial crimes section of the FBI.
[08:09.280 --> 08:12.400]  Goldman: You know, we're taking this very seriously
[08:12.400 --> 08:14.960]  Goldman: and looking into this very seriously.
[08:14.960 --> 08:15.800]  Val: I gotcha.
[08:15.800 --> 08:16.640]  Val: I totally believe you.
[08:16.640 --> 08:18.720]  Val: And I mean, if you're hiring all these people,
[08:18.720 --> 08:20.640]  Val: I'm sure you got something in your budget
[08:20.640 --> 08:24.440]  Val: to throw me over to DC or come out here
[08:24.440 --> 08:26.520]  Val: or catch a flight or even-
[08:26.520 --> 08:28.360]  Goldman: I think it's probably the news-
[08:28.360 --> 08:29.720]  Val: A flash drive.
[08:29.720 --> 08:31.080]  Val: What?
[08:31.080 --> 08:32.080]  Goldman: What's that about a flash drive?
[08:32.080 --> 08:33.760]  Val: Or even a flash drive, you know?
[08:33.760 --> 08:36.920]  Val: Like, it's something.
[08:36.920 --> 08:38.440]  Val: I mean, it's some kind of compromise here
[08:38.440 --> 08:40.640]  Val: to help me trust you guys.
[08:40.640 --> 08:43.920]  Val: I believe what you're doing and I don't doubt you-
[08:43.920 --> 08:47.720]  Goldman: I can send you a flash drive, but that's what-
[08:47.720 --> 08:48.560]  Val: No, I'm sorry.
[08:48.560 --> 08:52.200]  Val: That was, I meant like, when I went to go meet Schiff,
[08:52.200 --> 08:54.920]  Val: I said, hey, can you guys provide the flash drive?
[08:54.920 --> 08:56.640]  Val: I should have given you context for that.
[08:56.640 --> 08:58.520]  Val: But, because it was just weird that you wanted me
[08:58.520 --> 09:00.280]  Val: to give you my own flash drive,
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.000]  Val: which could have had millions of malicious scripts on it.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.520]  Val: So I was like, let's just keep things like, you know,
[09:06.520 --> 09:09.120]  Val: copacetic in a sense where you give me a-
[09:09.120 --> 09:11.400]  Goldman: We have very sophisticated technology
[09:11.400 --> 09:13.040]  Goldman: where we run all sorts of tests
[09:13.040 --> 09:17.240]  Goldman: because we work in a secure classified setting.
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.240]  Goldman: So I wasn't worried about your malware.
[09:22.480 --> 09:26.160]  Goldman: We just scrub everything very, very carefully.
[09:26.160 --> 09:27.000]  Val: Okay, good.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.240]  Goldman: But, no, I mean, the district office is not,
[09:30.240 --> 09:31.360]  Goldman: that's not what they do.
[09:31.360 --> 09:35.560]  Val: No, but look, why is it a problem just to say,
[09:35.560 --> 09:38.680]  Val: to put me in the room and say, look, here are the emails,
[09:38.680 --> 09:40.320]  Val: Dan, what do you guys need?
[09:40.320 --> 09:43.200]  Val: Let me show you how I set up the database.
[09:43.200 --> 09:45.440]  Val: What's like a first topic you want?
[09:45.440 --> 09:46.840]  Val: Let's do a search.
[09:46.840 --> 09:48.600]  Val: Let me show you some emails.
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.800]  Val: Let me show you what my dad,
[09:49.800 --> 09:51.160]  Val: let me tell you about my father first
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.960]  Val: so you get a sense of him.
[09:52.960 --> 09:54.560]  Val: Let me show you what his tone is like.
[09:54.560 --> 09:56.320]  Val: Here's an email where he's angry.
[09:56.320 --> 09:59.160]  Val: Here's an email where he's, you know,
[09:59.160 --> 10:00.840]  Val: trying to be politically correct.
[10:00.840 --> 10:04.560]  Val: Here's what he means when he says ring fencing
[10:04.560 --> 10:05.640]  Val: with Bill Winters.
[10:05.640 --> 10:08.840]  Val: You know, here's what the context behind
[10:08.840 --> 10:11.240]  Val: the Johnson and Johnson Quest diagnostic trade.
[10:11.240 --> 10:13.520]  Val: Here's what 1.1 billion, this is what this means.
[10:13.520 --> 10:16.480]  Val: Like, let me sit down and inform you guys of these things.
[10:16.480 --> 10:17.320]  Val: I mean-
[10:17.320 --> 10:18.760]  Goldman: Because a lot of that stuff is completely irrelevant
[10:18.760 --> 10:19.720]  Goldman: to what we're looking at.
[10:19.720 --> 10:22.920]  Val: Well, I mean, I'm just thinking that top of my head.
[10:22.920 --> 10:24.200]  Val: I mean, for the stuff that is,
[10:24.200 --> 10:26.000]  Val: oh, that's what you're trying to tell me.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.640]  Val: Okay, now it makes sense.
[10:27.640 --> 10:30.200]  Val: So you can't tell me what's relevant to the investigation,
[10:30.200 --> 10:31.760]  Val: which is why you don't want me out there,
[10:31.760 --> 10:33.360]  Val: because then you would have to tell me
[10:33.360 --> 10:35.200]  Val: in order to do the searches.
[10:35.200 --> 10:37.440]  Val: Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[10:37.440 --> 10:41.760]  Goldman: No, I mean, I didn't realize that,
[10:41.760 --> 10:44.440]  Goldman: I didn't really understand how you envisioned it going.
[10:44.440 --> 10:46.280]  Goldman: I didn't know you had a database of the searches,
[10:46.280 --> 10:48.360]  Goldman: but yes, now that you're mentioning that,
[10:48.360 --> 10:49.560]  Goldman: that is definitely true,
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.040]  Goldman: that we cannot disclose specifically
[10:54.040 --> 10:55.120]  Goldman: what we're looking for
[10:55.120 --> 10:57.400]  Goldman: and what the searches are that we would want to do.
[10:57.400 --> 11:00.560]  Goldman: So, honestly, like, I'll be honest with you, Val,
[11:00.560 --> 11:03.680]  Goldman: I would have happily flown you to DC
[11:03.680 --> 11:06.520]  Goldman: if we didn't get really bad budget news.
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.440]  Goldman: So we were expecting a 20% increase in our budget,
[11:10.440 --> 11:13.120]  Goldman: and we got a 3% increase.
[11:13.120 --> 11:18.120]  Goldman: So that has, and I got the message from on high
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.840]  Goldman: that I need to cut as much as I possibly can.
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.440]  Goldman: And so, given your trip,
[11:27.440 --> 11:28.680]  Goldman: which would have been great,
[11:28.680 --> 11:31.840]  Goldman: was not deemed to be a necessity,
[11:31.840 --> 11:34.040]  Goldman: and so that's what got cut.
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.480]  Goldman: And that's why I didn't get back to you.
[11:35.480 --> 11:37.560]  Goldman: I would be happy to meet with you
[11:37.560 --> 11:42.560]  Goldman: and have you sort of explain whatever you wanted to explain.
[11:43.560 --> 11:47.520]  Goldman: And what I would propose is that, you know,
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.520]  Goldman: you send us the emails, we get them loaded on our system,
[11:52.840 --> 11:55.840]  Goldman: and we give you a call
[11:55.840 --> 11:57.880]  Goldman: and try to work it out over the phone.
[11:57.880 --> 12:00.360]  Goldman: Now, we can't do FaceTime because, as I said,
[12:00.360 --> 12:02.800]  Goldman: we don't have cell phones in our,
[12:02.800 --> 12:03.840]  Goldman: it's part of the reason sometimes
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.640]  Goldman: I don't get back to you so quickly is we have to,
[12:07.640 --> 12:10.240]  Goldman: because it's classified secure space,
[12:10.240 --> 12:12.240]  Goldman: we have to leave our cell phones called a SCIF.
[12:12.240 --> 12:14.520]  Goldman: We have to leave our cell phones outside.
[12:14.520 --> 12:17.560]  Goldman: So there's no FaceTime or anything like that,
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.400]  Goldman: but we can call you and we can go through
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.440]  Goldman: the materials with you so that you can give us
[12:26.440 --> 12:30.040]  Goldman: a little bit of that context to help us.
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.920]  Goldman: And you gotta just have faith
[12:34.920 --> 12:38.240]  Goldman: that we're doing a professional investigation.
[12:38.240 --> 12:40.920]  Val: Well, I mean, I do that.
[12:40.920 --> 12:43.040]  Val: I mean, like one thing I was just thinking,
[12:43.040 --> 12:44.640]  Val: oh, why don't you send me some keywords?
[12:44.640 --> 12:46.040]  Val: I'll do the searches for you
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.400]  Val: and then we can go over them together and start like that.
[12:49.400 --> 12:51.400]  Val: But then you can do that because then I'll know
[12:51.400 --> 12:53.640]  Val: what you're searching for is what you're telling me.
[12:53.640 --> 12:54.840]  Val: So then I'm thinking,
[12:56.480 --> 12:58.760]  Val: then I'm thinking, okay, what if I just give it to you,
[12:58.760 --> 13:00.640]  Val: but then I just don't feel comfortable doing that.
[13:00.640 --> 13:03.560]  Val: And then I'm thinking, wait, why did you guys go to meet
[13:03.560 --> 13:06.840]  Val: David, like for, let me just, there's one thing,
[13:06.840 --> 13:08.480]  Val: I mean, I appreciate, I did tell you,
[13:08.480 --> 13:10.760]  Val: I did refer you to David.
[13:10.760 --> 13:11.600]  Val: I did refer you.
[13:11.600 --> 13:14.560]  Goldman: We went to talk to David totally separate from you.
[13:14.560 --> 13:16.240]  Val: Well, I mean, but Dan, come on,
[13:16.240 --> 13:17.720]  Val: it looks like you're,
[13:17.720 --> 13:20.400]  Val: what it looks like from an outside point of view
[13:20.400 --> 13:23.600]  Val: is that you are inquiring about a source
[13:23.600 --> 13:25.680]  Val: from a New York Times reporter.
[13:25.680 --> 13:27.080]  Val: You're inquiring about his source.
[13:27.080 --> 13:29.320]  Val: That's what it looks like from an outside point of view.
[13:29.320 --> 13:31.600]  Val: And you didn't tell me about it.
[13:31.600 --> 13:32.520]  Val: And that was a little weird.
[13:32.520 --> 13:33.360]  Val: And I get it.
[13:33.360 --> 13:34.200]  Val: I was like, okay, they're gonna vet me.
[13:34.200 --> 13:35.040]  Val: They're trying to vet me.
[13:35.040 --> 13:35.880]  Val: And it's my fault,
[13:35.880 --> 13:37.760]  Val: cause I did refer you to David.
Goldman:Val Val Val
[13:37.760 --> 13:38.800]  Val: I did refer you guys.
[13:38.800 --> 13:39.800]  Goldman: I gotta tell you something about it.
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.800]  Goldman: I gotta tell you, we're not trying to vet you.
[13:43.800 --> 13:45.760]  Goldman: David Enrich is writing,
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.280]  Goldman: and probably knows more about Deutsche Bank
[13:48.280 --> 13:49.840]  Goldman: than anyone else out there.
[13:49.840 --> 13:51.880]  Goldman: He is, he's a book.
[13:51.880 --> 13:52.720]  Val: Right.
[13:52.720 --> 13:54.000]  Val: How do you think that is?
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.240]  Val: Where do you think that comes from?
[13:56.240 --> 13:59.680]  Val: Where do you think the majority of his sources come from?
[13:59.680 --> 14:01.480]  Goldman: A lot of information beyond your emails.
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.920]  Val: I know, I know,
[14:02.920 --> 14:04.120]  Val: but where do you think the sources
[14:04.120 --> 14:06.040]  Val: that you got that information came from?
[14:07.960 --> 14:11.960]  Goldman: Well, I mean, I assume that there's a lot more to it
[14:11.960 --> 14:13.800]  Goldman: than your emails.
[14:13.800 --> 14:18.200]  Val: Well, you have to assume that the emails give access
[14:18.200 --> 14:19.840]  Val: and my access gives,
[14:19.840 --> 14:23.840]  Val: my presence gives access to a lot of former executives,
[14:23.840 --> 14:26.160]  Val: a lot of people that are still working there
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.800]  Val: that are under the cloak of fucking anonymity currently.
[14:30.800 --> 14:32.560]  Val: Okay, a lot of that comes from me.
[14:32.560 --> 14:35.000]  Val: David started this, same time I started this.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.720]  Val: We're kind of in it together.
[14:36.720 --> 14:39.240]  Val: And it ramped up recently when I gave him access
[14:39.240 --> 14:43.040]  Val: to my database and all my contacts, everything I have.
[14:43.040 --> 14:44.360]  Val: And that's when that article started.
[14:44.360 --> 14:45.800]  Val: Well, who do you think is the main source?
[14:45.800 --> 14:47.600]  Val: What do you think he gets most of this stuff?
[14:47.600 --> 14:50.880]  Val: I mean, of course he's got his own, a couple.
[14:50.880 --> 14:51.880]  Val: But I mean, what do you think?
[14:51.880 --> 14:54.080]  Val: And then you guys coming, it just doesn't look good
[14:54.080 --> 14:56.320]  Val: when you're coming to inquire about a source
[14:56.320 --> 14:58.000]  Val: from a New York Times reporter.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.080]  Val: It just doesn't look good.
[14:59.080 --> 15:00.920]  Val: And I wish you guys would have told me.
[15:00.920 --> 15:03.720]  Val: I mean, I was a little weirded out by it,
[15:03.720 --> 15:06.400]  Val: but David sort of said you guys were legit
[15:06.400 --> 15:09.680]  Val: and you guys were ambitious and you guys were very smart
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.800]  Val: and you were just wanting to get the emails.
[15:11.800 --> 15:13.400]  Val: And there was no other agenda.
[15:13.400 --> 15:15.080]  Val: And I trust this judgment,
[15:15.080 --> 15:17.560]  Val: but I still felt it was a little weird, okay?
[15:17.560 --> 15:20.840]  Val: And I just, I want to help you, Dan, I want to help you,
[15:20.840 --> 15:23.560]  Val: but I just need some oversight into my father's emails.
[15:23.560 --> 15:25.360]  Val: That's all I'm asking just a little bit.
[15:25.360 --> 15:27.120]  Goldman: I don't know what that means, Val.
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.960]  Val: I mean, I want to be there to provide some context.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.640]  Val: I want to be able to look over his name.
[15:32.640 --> 15:35.560]  Val: Anything that's used, I want to be there to say,
[15:35.560 --> 15:38.480]  Val: okay, this is good and this is not good.
[15:38.480 --> 15:40.560]  Val: If you're like, Val, is this what this means?
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.800]  Val: Yes, this is what this means.
[15:41.800 --> 15:43.560]  Val: Like something like that, something simple.
[15:43.560 --> 15:47.120]  Goldman: I can't, as much as I would love to make that promise to you,
[15:47.120 --> 15:49.520]  Goldman: I can't, that's not how we operate.
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.200]  Val: I know, I know, but just like the FBI is doing,
[15:53.200 --> 15:54.280]  Val: exceptions are made.
[15:54.280 --> 15:56.480]  Val: I mean, you have an advisor role
[15:56.480 --> 15:58.760]  Val: next to your name at the bottom of your email.
[15:58.800 --> 16:00.040]  Val: You're an advisor.
[16:00.040 --> 16:00.960]  Val: You're also a lawyer.
[16:00.960 --> 16:03.360]  Val: So you have kind of two roles in this thing, right?
[16:03.360 --> 16:07.000]  Val: I mean, just something that I can have some control
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.320]  Val: over my father's name.
[16:09.360 --> 16:12.360]  Val: There must be something, some little bit of compromise here,
[16:12.360 --> 16:15.280]  Val: besides me just blindly sending you everything.
[16:15.280 --> 16:18.280]  Goldman: I mean, the only thing I can offer is, you know,
[16:18.280 --> 16:20.240]  Goldman: to regularly consult with you.
[16:20.240 --> 16:21.560]  Goldman: There's absolutely no position.
[16:21.560 --> 16:23.760]  Goldman: There's no final oversight.
[16:23.760 --> 16:27.120]  Goldman: You cannot have any insight into what we're doing,
[16:27.160 --> 16:29.640]  Goldman: to what our product is.
[16:29.640 --> 16:33.240]  Goldman: It's all like, it just, I don't break the rules.
[16:33.240 --> 16:34.760]  Goldman: I don't know what the FBI is doing,
[16:34.760 --> 16:36.880]  Goldman: but that's not how I operate.
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.440]  Goldman: So, you know, I've really gone to great lengths
[16:41.440 --> 16:45.880]  Goldman: to talk to you and to, you know,
[16:45.880 --> 16:49.000]  Goldman: to have a build a relationship with you
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.440]  Goldman: that frankly, I don't do with any other witnesses.
[16:52.960 --> 16:55.760]  Val: So we can't even really do a trial run either, can we?
[16:55.760 --> 16:58.760]  Val: Like I can't send you a batch of emails
[16:58.760 --> 17:02.000]  Val: and just see on one specific topic and see how that goes.
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.080]  Val: Like I was thinking of that.
[17:03.080 --> 17:05.080]  Val: Why don't we try one topic?
[17:05.080 --> 17:07.440]  Val:I'll send you some emails and see how it goes.
[17:07.440 --> 17:08.280]  Val:Start there.
[17:08.280 --> 17:09.320]  Val: But you can't even do that
[17:09.320 --> 17:11.600]  Val: because I can't know what you're looking for.
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.160]  Val: So what if you make me sign an NDA,
[17:15.160 --> 17:18.200]  Val: make me sign whatever you need me to sign,
[17:18.200 --> 17:21.160]  Val: vet me and then put my name next to it.
[17:21.160 --> 17:22.440]  Val: I'll do whatever you guys want
[17:22.440 --> 17:24.640]  Val: as long as I can have some oversight
[17:24.640 --> 17:26.040]  Val: and there's some compromise.
[17:26.920 --> 17:29.640]  Goldman: But put some, vet you and what?
[17:29.640 --> 17:30.840]  Goldman: Put your name next to what?
[17:30.840 --> 17:32.800]  Val: I mean, name next to some contract
[17:32.800 --> 17:34.640]  Val: that says Val can't talk about this
[17:34.640 --> 17:37.960]  Val: and Val is a non-disclosure agreement.
[17:37.960 --> 17:38.800]  Goldman: We can't do that.
[17:39.800 --> 17:42.360]  Goldman: Our committee rules don't allow for that.
[17:42.360 --> 17:44.000]  Val: Wow, man, this is frustrating.
[17:44.000 --> 17:44.840]  Val: Okay.
[17:47.680 --> 17:48.720]  Val: Well, I don't know, man.
[17:48.720 --> 17:49.560]  Val: I don't know.
[17:49.560 --> 17:51.920]  Val: I'm gonna have to think about it.
[17:51.920 --> 17:52.760]  Goldman: I don't know.
[17:52.920 --> 17:57.640]  Goldman: Obviously, I would like to collaborate with you
[17:57.640 --> 18:00.200]  Goldman: as much as we can within our rules.
[18:00.200 --> 18:02.560]  Goldman: I'd like to work with you,
[18:02.560 --> 18:05.000]  Goldman: but as you pointed out,
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.360]  Goldman: I don't wanna go this route,
[18:06.360 --> 18:08.880]  Goldman: but we can subpoena you
[18:08.880 --> 18:13.040]  Goldman: and I don't think that is the way this should go.
[18:13.040 --> 18:15.720]  Goldman: I've been obviously avoiding it for weeks now,
[18:16.920 --> 18:20.040]  Goldman: but I've done everything you've asked of me.
[18:20.760 --> 18:21.960]  Goldman: You know, you asked to...
[18:21.960 --> 18:23.880]  Val: You haven't done anything.
[18:23.880 --> 18:24.720]  Val: What do you mean?
[18:24.720 --> 18:26.720]  Goldman: You asked to meet with Congressman Schiff.
[18:26.720 --> 18:28.800]  Val: Again, Dan, I asked to meet with Schiff
[18:28.800 --> 18:31.360]  Val: so I can make sure you were who you were.
[18:31.360 --> 18:32.720]  Val: I don't care about Adam Schiff.
[18:32.720 --> 18:35.880]  Val: I wanted to make sure that you were not some crazy spy
[18:35.880 --> 18:38.000]  Val: or a crazy person on the end of the phone.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.080]  Val: I wanted to make sure you could do what you could do.
[18:40.080 --> 18:41.320]  Goldman: I don't know what your experiences have been.
[18:41.320 --> 18:42.160]  Val: It's terrible.
[18:42.160 --> 18:43.400]  Val: My experiences have been terrible.
[18:43.400 --> 18:45.960]  Val: I'm telling you, I've been screwed over
[18:45.960 --> 18:47.120]  Val: by so many people.
[18:47.120 --> 18:51.280]  Val: I mean, there's crazy people, spies, lawyers, politicians.
[18:51.280 --> 18:52.360]  Val: You name it.
[18:52.360 --> 18:53.200]  Val: Read the...
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.360]  Val: Ask David about the book.
[18:54.360 --> 18:55.680]  Val: It'll all be in the book.
[18:56.760 --> 18:59.640]  Val: I'm telling you, man, I gotta play it safe.
[18:59.640 --> 19:01.840]  Val: That's why I wanted you to put me in the room with Schiff
[19:01.840 --> 19:03.520]  Val: to make sure you were who you were
[19:03.520 --> 19:04.760]  Val: and you could do what you could do.
[19:04.760 --> 19:08.440]  Val: I can't just blindly hand over a bunch of freaking high,
[19:09.600 --> 19:10.960]  Val: high-value data emails
[19:10.960 --> 19:14.360]  Val: to someone I'd recommended on the phone by Moby.
[19:14.360 --> 19:15.200]  Val: I mean, come on.
[19:17.120 --> 19:20.040]  Goldman: I don't live in this, you know,
[19:20.040 --> 19:21.040]  Goldman: I mean, maybe I'm naive,
[19:21.040 --> 19:25.960]  Goldman: but I'm a pretty trusting person
[19:25.960 --> 19:30.720]  Goldman: and I, you know, I don't know how to relate to you
[19:30.720 --> 19:34.960]  Goldman: if this is what your concern is that, you know,
[19:34.960 --> 19:39.760]  Goldman: I don't really, I don't operate that way.
[19:39.760 --> 19:41.520]  Val: I mean, I know, Dan, I believe you,
[19:41.520 --> 19:43.360]  Val: but it's like, show, don't tell.
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.680]  Val: You know, that's the thing.
[19:44.680 --> 19:46.400]  Val: You can say whatever you want.
[19:46.520 --> 19:47.840]  Val: You did, you did.
[19:47.840 --> 19:48.680]  Goldman: I have showed you.
[19:48.680 --> 19:50.160]  Val: You have, absolutely you have.
[19:50.160 --> 19:52.200]  Goldman: If you wanted me to do in order to vet me
[19:52.200 --> 19:54.160]  Goldman: or whatever it is that you want me to do,
[19:54.160 --> 19:55.560]  Goldman: I can't fly you to DC
[19:55.560 --> 19:57.240]  Goldman: because I don't have the budget for it.
[19:57.240 --> 19:58.080]  Val: Then come out here.
[19:58.080 --> 20:01.560]  Goldman: I don't have time for the budget to go to LA to do this.
[20:01.560 --> 20:05.120]  Goldman: So it's, you know, I've got many different things
[20:05.120 --> 20:07.520]  Goldman: that go on in the course of a day
[20:07.520 --> 20:10.800]  Goldman: and I can guarantee you that I have spent
[20:10.800 --> 20:13.160]  Goldman: exponentially more time talking to you
[20:13.160 --> 20:14.880]  Goldman: about getting these documents
[20:14.880 --> 20:17.840]  Goldman: than I have to Deutsche Bank itself
[20:17.840 --> 20:20.760]  Goldman: or to any other witnesses that, you know.
[20:20.760 --> 20:21.960]  Val: Okay, great.
[20:21.960 --> 20:23.320]  Val: So you spent a lot of time on this.
[20:23.320 --> 20:24.160]  Val: Great. Thank you.
[20:24.160 --> 20:25.280]  Val: I appreciate it.
[20:25.280 --> 20:26.400]  Val: I appreciate it.
[20:26.400 --> 20:29.920]  Goldman: But look, I'm frankly, you know,
[20:29.920 --> 20:33.400]  Goldman: I'm a little bit at the end of the road here.
[20:33.400 --> 20:36.080]  Goldman: I don't have anything more to offer you.
[20:36.080 --> 20:36.920]  Val: Okay.
[20:38.120 --> 20:40.520]  Val: You haven't offered me anything.
[20:40.520 --> 20:43.400]  Val: So if you want to subpoena me,
[20:43.440 --> 20:44.920]  Val: okay, well, we'll take it from there.
[20:44.920 --> 20:46.040]  Val: Let's see what happens.
[20:46.040 --> 20:48.200]  Val: I mean, that's a whole 'nother road.
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.880]  Val: And if you're prepared to do that,
[20:51.240 --> 20:53.360]  Val: then you're taking an adversarial role to me.
[20:53.360 --> 20:56.120]  Val: Then you will be taking an adversarial role.
[20:56.120 --> 20:59.600]  Goldman: And as I said to you, I don't want to subpoena you.
[20:59.600 --> 21:00.720]  Val: Okay.
[21:00.720 --> 21:05.080]  Goldman: So what ultimately will happen is,
[21:05.080 --> 21:06.720]  Goldman: in the way that Congress works,
[21:06.720 --> 21:08.440]  Goldman: and you need to understand this,
[21:08.440 --> 21:11.920]  Goldman: the difference in a prosecution
[21:11.920 --> 21:14.240]  Goldman: and a congressional investigation is that
[21:14.240 --> 21:17.200]  Goldman: the strength of a congressional investigation
[21:17.200 --> 21:20.960]  Goldman: is the threat of publicity,
[21:20.960 --> 21:23.680]  Goldman: or transparency, or exposure.
[21:23.680 --> 21:26.040]  Goldman: In a grand jury investigation,
[21:27.600 --> 21:29.440]  Goldman: there are requirements that everything
[21:29.440 --> 21:31.080]  Goldman: must be kept confidential.
[21:31.080 --> 21:34.120]  Goldman: That is not the case in a congressional investigation.
[21:34.120 --> 21:35.840]  Goldman: So you can say to yourself,
[21:35.840 --> 21:38.920]  Goldman: I don't give a shit about a congressional subpoena.
[21:38.920 --> 21:43.240]  Goldman: But what could happen if this gets adversarial?
[21:43.240 --> 21:46.080]  Goldman: And again, Val, I've been spending a lot of time with you
[21:46.080 --> 21:47.360]  Goldman: on the phone and otherwise
[21:47.360 --> 21:49.240]  Goldman: to try to avoid it becoming adversarial.
[21:49.240 --> 21:52.280]  Goldman: I'd like to work with you as much as I possibly can.
[21:52.280 --> 21:54.600]  Goldman: I'm not trying to go down this road.
[21:54.600 --> 21:57.520]  Goldman: But everything that you're worried about,
[21:57.520 --> 22:02.520]  Goldman: about the exposure of your father and yourself, frankly,
[22:05.240 --> 22:08.680]  Goldman: if you're not complying with a congressional subpoena,
[22:08.720 --> 22:11.080]  Goldman: would all go out there in the public.
[22:11.080 --> 22:12.800]  Goldman: And I don't think that's what you want.
[22:12.800 --> 22:16.600]  Goldman: And I don't think that that would be helpful to your case.
[22:16.600 --> 22:19.440]  Goldman: And I'm not, I really don't want it to be adversarial.
[22:19.440 --> 22:22.280]  Goldman: But there's nothing more that I can do
[22:22.280 --> 22:26.480]  Goldman: other than write, I wrote you the letter that you asked for,
[22:26.480 --> 22:28.560]  Goldman: so that you could see it on official letterhead
[22:28.560 --> 22:33.560]  Goldman: with Congressman Schiff's signature, sent that to you.
[22:34.120 --> 22:37.960]  Goldman: At some point, you gotta send the emails.
[22:37.960 --> 22:42.960]  Goldman: And we will be careful and we'll coordinate with you
[22:43.280 --> 22:46.480]  Goldman: and we'll make sure that you understand
[22:46.480 --> 22:49.160]  Goldman: how we view some things.
[22:49.160 --> 22:51.720]  Goldman: And we're happy for you to pick out some
[22:51.720 --> 22:53.600]  Goldman: and try to explain your father's tone
[22:53.600 --> 22:54.640]  Goldman: and the way that he does it.
[22:54.640 --> 22:56.760]  Goldman: I'm more than happy to go out on the phone with you
[22:56.760 --> 22:59.280]  Goldman: and go over that so that you can provide us
[22:59.280 --> 23:02.520]  Goldman: with sort of the personal context of it all.
[23:02.520 --> 23:07.520]  Goldman: But at this point, we don't have a ton of time
[23:08.120 --> 23:09.760]  Goldman: left in this Congress.
[23:09.760 --> 23:13.280]  Goldman: We're trying to move ahead and we really need the stuff.
[23:13.280 --> 23:17.080]  Val: Okay, well, look, suddenly I'm reminded of my meetings
[23:17.080 --> 23:19.400]  Val: with John Moscow who promised me the world,
[23:19.400 --> 23:21.980]  Val: that they'd talk to me and give me phone calls
[23:21.980 --> 23:25.720]  Val: and refer to me for all these things and blah, blah, blah.
[23:25.720 --> 23:27.040]  Val: And then at the end of the day,
[23:27.040 --> 23:31.080]  Val: soon as they got what they wanted, I was cut out.
[23:31.080 --> 23:32.560]  Val: And that's what I'm thinking of.
[23:32.560 --> 23:34.280]  Val: And that's just one example.
[23:34.280 --> 23:35.920]  Val: And you wanna talk about Glenn?
[23:35.920 --> 23:37.480]  Goldman: I don't know who John Moscow is.
[23:37.480 --> 23:40.720]  Val: Yeah, you did last time we spoke, John Moscow.
[23:40.720 --> 23:45.120]  Val: Baker Hostetler represents Natalia Veselnitskaya
[23:45.120 --> 23:48.500]  Val: and hires Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS, John Moscow.
[23:49.800 --> 23:51.460]  Val: Used to work with SDNY.
[23:52.720 --> 23:54.440]  Goldman: Well, I mean, there are a lot of people at SDNY.
[23:54.440 --> 23:56.720]  Goldman: I never worked with John Moscow.
[23:56.720 --> 23:58.560]  Val: Well, you look them up.
[23:58.560 --> 24:00.640]  Val: Anyway, this is where I'm hearing.
[24:00.640 --> 24:03.680]  Val: And look, man, it just feels so adversarial.
[24:03.680 --> 24:05.800]  Val: All I wanted to do was help, you know,
[24:05.800 --> 24:08.520]  Val: and all I wanted to do was have some say
[24:08.520 --> 24:10.760]  Val: in how my father's things were used.
[24:10.760 --> 24:11.880]  Val: That's all I want.
[24:11.880 --> 24:12.960]  Val: And you're saying no.
[24:12.960 --> 24:16.200]  Goldman: I mean, you say that as if it's so to a simple request.
[24:16.200 --> 24:18.600]  Goldman: Like, you're not a part of our investigation,
[24:18.600 --> 24:20.520]  Goldman: our committee, you're a witness.
[24:20.520 --> 24:24.520]  Goldman: You have, actually, you're just really a custodian
[24:24.520 --> 24:29.360]  Goldman: of emails that are relevant to our investigation.
[24:29.360 --> 24:32.120]  Goldman: An any good prosecutor or investigator.
[24:32.120 --> 24:33.700]  Val: From your point of view,
[24:33.700 --> 24:36.100]  Val: from your point of view, I'm a custodian of emails.
[24:36.100 --> 24:37.820]  Val: From my point of view, I'm a custodian
[24:37.820 --> 24:40.500]  Val: and curator of my father's name.
[24:40.500 --> 24:42.620]  Val: That's maybe you're not quite getting that still.
[24:42.620 --> 24:43.460]  Val: And how important.
[24:43.460 --> 24:45.820]  Val: Imagine if it was your father, what would you do?
[24:45.820 --> 24:48.500]  Val: You'd do anything you can to protect him, right?
[24:49.980 --> 24:51.820]  Val: I mean, I don't know your relationship with your father,
[24:51.820 --> 24:54.260]  Val: but put yourself in my position.
Goldman: My father died when I was thirteen.
[24:54.260 --> 24:55.660]  Val: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[24:55.660 --> 24:57.300]  Val: But I mean, someone that, it's like a father,
[24:57.300 --> 24:58.700]  Val: like figure to you.
[24:58.700 --> 25:01.620]  Val: You do anything to protect them and their name, right?
[25:01.620 --> 25:02.900]  Val: And that's what I'm doing.
[25:02.900 --> 25:05.100]  Val: And I don't know why I'm getting so much guff
[25:05.100 --> 25:06.620]  Val: for trying to do this from you guys.
[25:06.620 --> 25:09.740]  Val: I mean, if you want to, it feels so adversarial, man.
[25:09.740 --> 25:11.380]  Val: Like you want to come at me, I mean, with a subpoena,
[25:11.380 --> 25:13.380]  Val: that's fine, but be prepared.
[25:13.380 --> 25:14.660]  Val: There is, you will, I mean,
[25:14.660 --> 25:16.860]  Val: you don't look good what you're doing right now.
[25:16.860 --> 25:17.900]  Val: It doesn't look good for you.
[25:17.900 --> 25:20.180]  Val: You want to come out with a subpoena, then fine.
[25:20.180 --> 25:23.820]  Val: Then you all of a sudden, you're tagging New York Times
[25:23.820 --> 25:26.380]  Val: for their sources, your promise.
[25:26.380 --> 25:27.420]  Val: I mean, come on, man.
[25:27.420 --> 25:28.580]  Val: It doesn't look good what you're doing.
[25:28.580 --> 25:31.860]  Val: You're taking the son of a esteemed banker
[25:31.860 --> 25:34.460]  Val: and trying to pressure him to giving you all this shit.
[25:34.460 --> 25:35.780]  Val: And without any oversight,
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.620]  Val: without any control over his name,
[25:36.620 --> 25:37.620]  Val: it doesn't look good for you.
[25:37.620 --> 25:38.460]  Val: You want to do that?
[25:38.460 --> 25:39.300]  Val: There's men.
[25:39.300 --> 25:40.140]  Goldman: I will tell you that.
[25:40.140 --> 25:40.980]  Goldman: I will tell you one thing.
[25:40.980 --> 25:41.820]  Val: What?
[25:41.820 --> 25:45.540]  Goldman: I have never in all of my career had anyone
[25:45.540 --> 25:49.540]  Goldman: who provided documents with, you know,
[25:49.540 --> 25:52.460]  Goldman: with the number and the degree of strings
[25:52.460 --> 25:54.980]  Goldman: that you are trying to attach to it.
[25:54.980 --> 25:58.540]  Goldman: And I recognize your concern about your father's reputation.
[25:58.540 --> 26:01.660]  Goldman: And I fully, fully understand that
[26:01.660 --> 26:03.860]  Goldman: contrary to what you're saying.
[26:03.860 --> 26:07.340]  Goldman: I resent you saying that we met with David Enrich,
[26:07.340 --> 26:10.140]  Goldman: you know, for anything related to you.
[26:10.140 --> 26:11.900]  Val: But you talked about me.
[26:11.900 --> 26:12.740]  Val: You did.
[26:12.740 --> 26:13.580]  Val: You asked him about me.
[26:13.580 --> 26:15.420]  Val: You asked him if I was crazy,
[26:15.420 --> 26:17.180]  Val: if we asked him about the FBI.
[26:17.180 --> 26:18.340]  Val: You asked him everything.
[26:18.340 --> 26:19.940]  Val: I mean, you think David's not going to tell me?
[26:19.940 --> 26:22.660]  Goldman: I didn't ask, I didn't ask whether you were crazy or not.
[26:22.660 --> 26:24.500]  Val: Well, I mean, if you said, if you were to find out,
[26:24.500 --> 26:25.700]  Val: like, what's with the FBI?
[26:25.700 --> 26:28.100]  Val: You asked if I was like, well, what is this?
[26:28.100 --> 26:30.940]  Val: What was the word you guys used?
[26:30.940 --> 26:31.780]  Val: I don't know.
[26:31.780 --> 26:33.060]  Val: You were baffled by me or something.
[26:33.060 --> 26:35.580]  Val: You didn't know if I was making up
[26:35.580 --> 26:37.940]  Val: if I wanted a free trip to DC for God's sakes.
[26:37.940 --> 26:38.940]  Val: I mean, come on, man.
[26:38.940 --> 26:41.220]  Val: You asked a reporter about his source.
[26:41.220 --> 26:43.060]  Val: You interrogated him about his source.
[26:43.060 --> 26:44.220]  Val: It doesn't look good.
[26:45.140 --> 26:47.100]  Val: Okay, maybe the rest of the conversation
[26:47.100 --> 26:48.420]  Val: was about Deutsche Bank.
[26:48.420 --> 26:51.420]  Goldman: Before you start accusing me of doing it.
[26:51.420 --> 26:52.740]  Val: I'm not accusing you, man.
[26:52.740 --> 26:54.380]  Val: I'm not accusing you.
[26:54.380 --> 26:56.980]  Goldman: I went to that meeting with David Enrich.
[26:56.980 --> 26:59.820]  Goldman: I'm totally unrelated to you, okay?
[26:59.820 --> 27:01.340]  Goldman: Yes, did your name come up?
[27:01.340 --> 27:06.100]  Goldman: It did because you are proving to be very, very difficult
[27:06.100 --> 27:09.100]  Goldman: to deal with in obtaining these emails when,
[27:09.100 --> 27:12.220]  Goldman: and I'm surprised because you reached out to us.
[27:12.220 --> 27:13.500]  Goldman: I didn't know about these emails,
[27:13.500 --> 27:15.700]  Goldman: but for the fact that you reached out to us.
[27:15.700 --> 27:18.300]  Val: Right, I get it.
[27:18.300 --> 27:19.700]  Val: I want it, I want-
[27:19.700 --> 27:22.260]  Goldman: And yet now there are all these strings attached
[27:22.260 --> 27:23.260]  Goldman: and all these-
[27:23.260 --> 27:24.860]  Val: All these strings.
[27:24.860 --> 27:27.100]  Val: I'm asking you to do one simple thing,
[27:27.100 --> 27:29.060]  Val: and that's let me have some oversight.
[27:29.060 --> 27:31.300]  Goldman: You say it's a simple thing, it's not a simple thing.
[27:31.300 --> 27:32.500]  Val: Dan you're a smart guy.
[27:32.500 --> 27:34.860]  Val: You can figure out a way to make it happen, man.
[27:34.860 --> 27:35.780]  Val: You can figure it out.
[27:35.780 --> 27:37.180]  Val: I can figure shit out on my own.
[27:37.180 --> 27:38.660]  Val: You can do the same thing too.
[27:38.660 --> 27:40.540]  Val: There's must be a way to make it happen.
[27:40.540 --> 27:41.940]  Val: It's really simple.
[27:41.940 --> 27:43.580]  Val: I'll just want some oversight.
[27:43.580 --> 27:45.900]  Val: What that looks like, show me what that looks like to you.
[27:45.900 --> 27:46.740]  Val: Something.
[27:46.740 --> 27:48.820]  Val: It's my father, for God's sakes, man.
[27:50.900 --> 27:51.740]  Goldman: All right, Val.
[27:51.740 --> 27:52.580]  Goldman: You do what you need to do
[27:52.580 --> 27:53.980]  Goldman: and I'll do what I need to do.
[27:54.020 --> 27:54.860]  Val: Okay.
[27:54.860 --> 27:55.700]  Goldman: Okay.
[27:55.700 --> 27:56.700]  Goldman: All right, bye.
[27:57.900 --> 27:58.740]  Val: Jesus.
[27:58.740 --> 27:59.740]  Marie: What did he say?
[27:59.740 --> 28:01.060]  I did?
[28:01.060 --> 28:02.180]  Okay.
[28:02.180 --> 28:03.580]  Val: He said, okay, you do what you need to do.
[28:03.580 --> 28:04.780]  Val: I do what I need to do.
[28:07.180 --> 28:08.020]  Val: That's a threat.
