[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:11.800]  Yeah?
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:14.640]  All right, let's do it.
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:16.480]  What do you want?
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:17.760]  No, no, no, I just...
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:19.280]  Yeah, I want sandwiches, then.
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:20.120]  Really?
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:20.960]  Yeah.
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:21.800]  What kind of sandwich?
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:23.320]  A sandwich or...
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.160]  Okay.
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:26.160]  Sure, well, yeah, I'd love one.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:29.360]  Gratsen, that's nice.
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:31.520]  I'll put on a mask or whatever.
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:33.240]  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:36.920]  What was I gonna show you?
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:39.600]  At the time, you're...
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:44.560]  Look, I don't know allegiance to these guys at all.
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:47.520]  I mean, they've just, they've become sort of friends, but,
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:51.600]  you know, as much as you can have a friend on that,
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:56.840]  that doesn't tell you anything about that, right?
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:59.520]  It's just sort of fun, more fun sort of.
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:03.120]  Like, you're in the workplace,
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:05.840]  you're not friends with all your workers, right?
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:07.160]  No, I don't feel right for now.
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:11.480]  Oh, yeah, I'll hit the head, you know where it is, right?
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:12.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:13.320]  You guys are just gonna go...
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:14.800]  But I'll wait for you, because you can't fit out.
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:15.640]  Oh, that's right.
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:22.600]  So what's your specialty?
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:24.720]  No, same, but I just happened to work in this office.
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:25.560]  In this office?
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:27.920]  Right, so, if you say, like, laundry.
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:28.760]  Yeah?
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.640]  Of course, he, you know, he flew here to speak to you,
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.200]  so let him, let him, yeah, yeah, he flew here yesterday.
[02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:37.120]  I didn't know it was just for me,
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  I just thought he was coming here
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.240]  and I wanted to speak to you while he was here.
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.920]  Yeah, so, for me, like, when you're in management,
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:45.840]  I'm like, oh, okay, like, a lot of these guys on the floor
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:48.560]  do, like, business email compromise, and a lot of guys,
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:49.400]  like...
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:50.240]  Did you, what?
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.240]  I didn't hear you.
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:52.480]  Business email compromise?
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:53.320]  Oh, really?
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:54.840]  Yeah, I don't know, okay.
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:55.960]  That's easy, yeah.
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:59.120]  Yeah, so, business email compromise, and then...
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:00.080]  Is that a term for it?
[02:51:00.080 --> 02:51:01.280]  Just business email compromise?
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:02.440]  There's a, I didn't know there was a term for it.
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:03.880]  Yeah, so a lot of things out of Nigeria,
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:05.200]  and it's just funny, when you mentioned
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:07.280]  you're not lobbying, is there a thing like...
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:09.720]  Yeah, one of our guys over here,
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:13.120]  they just got someone out of, like, Dubai,
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:14.080]  or something like that.
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:14.920]  Yeah, okay.
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:15.880]  Cool.
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:19.200]  And they're digging into that versus something like,
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:21.520]  they're special to you, like, laundering,
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:22.600]  laundering money, right?
[02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:25.480]  So, like, romance, victim, romance scam victims,
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:26.560]  like a victimized...
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.480]  Oh, yeah, I heard that.
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:31.520]  Eventually, he gets out to, like, Canada, China,
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:32.640]  or all these other countries,
[02:51:32.640 --> 02:51:34.840]  and there's, like, a whole money mule network
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:36.240]  that's, like, pretty tough to...
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.080]  Is it really?
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:37.920]  Is it like a company?
[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.080]  Is it one person behind it, or is it...
[02:51:39.080 --> 02:51:41.520]  No, no, no, it's all a loose connection, yeah.
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:42.360]  Loose.
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:43.200]  Interesting.
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:46.800]  It's like a, like, a lead in welding connections
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:50.960]  sort of thing, like, there was a...
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:52.960]  Basically, like, very, very...
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:54.200]  And they all know each other in person,
[02:51:54.200 --> 02:51:55.040]  that's the difference.
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:55.880]  Oh, they do?
[02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:56.720]  They know each other, it's like,
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:57.560]  oh, you know this guy?
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:52:00.040]  He's leading, interested in, you know,
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:03.080]  doing some work, opening bank accounts, and stuff like that.
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:04.640]  Ah, I understand that, yeah.
[02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:07.440]  So, like, they're friends in Nigeria?
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:09.440]  Or in the community?
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.440]  Shit, you know we did?
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:14.400]  We had to, like, this lawyer was essentially an asshole.
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:18.040]  He said, we need your narrative to store ACP for Monday.
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:21.120]  So, I went on the Fiverr, and I tried to find it.
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:21.960]  Oh, Fiverr.
[02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:24.120]  It's a narrative of Marie's story.
[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:25.320]  Fiverr.
[02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:26.800]  So, I went on Fiverr?
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:27.640]  Oh, sure.
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:31.080]  I went on Fiverr.
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:31.920]  Really?
[02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:35.320]  I found someone to do a live transcription
[02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:36.800]  and it's a Nigerian guy.
[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:40.120]  He wanted to be paid in Bitcoin yesterday or tomorrow.
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:42.960]  And Marie says, no, I'm not gonna pay you that.
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:45.440]  And then he says, okay, and that's it.
[02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:50.440]  So, I'm thinking, well, he just got all of Marie's
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:52.440]  information since she was a child.
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:55.440]  So, he should probably pay the guy, right?
[02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:57.280]  It's a new scam, I think.
[02:52:57.280 --> 02:52:58.560]  You're doing transcription services,
[02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:01.360]  get your private data, and then sell that data.
[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:02.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:04.480]  Nigerian's committing fraud.
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:05.320]  What do you mean?
[02:53:07.320 --> 02:53:10.080]  Like crazy, you know, connoisseurs, yes.
[02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:13.920]  I mean, they're in that rush, they're doing good stuff.
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:17.800]  Why isn't that, why is that the hotbed here,
[02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:19.320]  criminal activity?
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:22.240]  I don't know, it's what's called like training, you know?
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:23.080]  Training stuff.
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:23.920]  You're gonna wait here real quick?
[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:24.760]  Okay.
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:28.320]  You think they train each other and like,
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:29.960]  you know, it's like, hey, you know,
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:31.640]  you grow up with all these people and like,
[02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:33.840]  hey, you want to make a cash and then they say,
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:35.840]  all you gotta do is you send out these emails,
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:37.640]  there's this script and whatever,
[02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:39.080]  and then they teach other people.
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:42.720]  It's like any other criminal organization.
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:44.240]  That's the way it works, it's all good.
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:46.000]  Right now, I guess they're,
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.120]  I haven't been looking around right here,
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:48.880]  but they're like in protest right now?
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:49.720]  Oh, really?
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:52.200]  I don't see anything, so Pat's gonna cut it off.
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:53.040]  I'm gonna say there's no, like,
[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:54.800]  see any signers or whatever.
[02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:56.440]  Yeah, that'd be bad.
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:53:57.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:58.280]  Yeah, I don't know why that.
[02:53:58.280 --> 02:53:59.120]  Yeah.
[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:02.640]  Huh.
[02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:03.840]  Where are they protesting?
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:06.440]  There's the answer, you know?
[02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:09.800]  Don't join, pal.
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:11.320]  Don't do it, don't do it.
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:14.800]  You guys get a bad rap, you know?
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:16.760]  Like seriously, I was like everybody else
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:18.520]  until I met Tim and Jenny.
[02:54:18.520 --> 02:54:19.360]  Yeah.
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.200]  And then I was like, you know,
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.040]  I can't believe I considered you guys people, guys.
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:25.120]  What are you doing here, dude?
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:27.760]  You just being careful on me, yeah.
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:29.680]  How'd you guys get started on this?
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:31.920]  I don't know, I just started a little while ago.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:33.440]  I always wanted to do it as a kid.
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:34.280]  Yeah?
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:35.520]  Here I am, so I'm talking to Dad.
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:36.840]  Did you good do the whole training
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:38.840]  and either you taught you everything now
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:40.000]  or did you know before?
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  Not much, not much.
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.360]  Oh, for the computer stuff I went to,
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:45.880]  my degree is in there.
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:46.720]  Oh, it is?
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:47.560]  I don't know about that.
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.960]  I'm like, oh no, but yeah,
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:51.200]  fan thing is I want to do it as a kid
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:54.600]  and then easily enough, you just apply online, everything.
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:55.640]  Yeah.
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:58.400]  Yeah, so it's not like you know a guy or whatever.
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:54:59.760]  No, that's cool, that's cool.
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:00.600]  Interesting.
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:01.440]  How lucky.
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:03.000]  That's good.
