[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  So I,
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  uh,
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  confronted her,
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  and she was,
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  uh,
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.000]  had a show in Australia
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  doing,
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  selling a bunch of,
[26:28.000 --> 26:29.000]  uh,
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  she had a personal,
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  like her first cool show in Adeline,
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  I think,
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  with her,
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  Sydney.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  I don't remember.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  So,
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  um,
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  she ends up,
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  she knows my mother,
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  because my mother,
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  um,
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  she know that story, right?
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  So he killed himself,
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  and my mother needs something to do,
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  after she,
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  uh,
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  robbed me and everyone else in the family
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  of all our money.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  Um,
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  went to,
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  back to,
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  uh, art school in New York,
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  and,
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  uh,
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  Marie was just about to leave her husband,
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  and she went to art school in New York at the same time.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  So my mom's like 64,
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Marie was like 34 at the same time,
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  but they hit it off,
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  became friends.
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  You know,
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  Marie actually stayed on my mom's house,
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  she knows my sisters,
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  she did like cocaine with my mother,
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  which is weird.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  You could imagine,
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  with stories,
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  it's very weird.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  Um,
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  anyway,
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  so,
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  and not to incriminate me.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  It's a joke,
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  you guys say.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  Having coffee with friends.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  Right, right.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  So,
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  um,
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  and then we hit it off,
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  and she came back to LA,
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  and she lived in LA fortunately,
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  and,
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  uh,
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  and David needed somebody to,
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  um,
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  and my mother's side was not talking,
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  and at this point,
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  I was still friends with David,
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  David Unridge,
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  and he is someone on my mom's count,
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  and so I said,
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  you know what,
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  I think I got the perfect person,
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  I'm gonna,
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  I'm gonna flip her,
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  and take her from my mom's side,
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  bring her to our side,
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  it's a good side of the force,
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  right,
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.000]  and I did,
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  you know,
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  and I did,
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  and she became a source of the book,
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  and she told David
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  all the blanks he,
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  uh,
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  was missing,
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  and we moved in together,
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  you know,
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  all my life,
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  I've been like a bachelor,
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  you know,
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  kind of spoiled brat,
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  mostly too,
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  and my dad,
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  kind of financed my life,
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  so I,
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  I made music,
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  I had 36 albums in a single,
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  I had a lot of girlfriends,
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  I fucked around,
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  I went on tour,
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  I had fun,
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  you know,
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  and that all,
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  went to zero,
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  and it all stopped,
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  immediately,
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  and January 26, 2014,
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  and I learned,
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  I learned a lot since then,
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  a lot of things have changed for me,
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  and I've never dated a girl
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  with a kid,
[28:28.000 --> 28:29.000]  and I was like,
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  you know what,
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  I really love her,
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  and I really like this kid,
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  so why the fuck not?
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  I mean,
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  my father,
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  my mom,
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  when I was a kid,
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  you know,
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  and,
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  he's a good kid,
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  and it's not that,
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  I mean,
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  it's hard to raise a kid,
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  believe me,
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was,
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.000]  you know,
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  especially when he's a good kid,
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  you know,
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  he's really happy,
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  but, you know,
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  and like,
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  most of that's really from me.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  They say it's a much stronger love.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  That you'll ever love,
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  yeah,
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  it's true,
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  it's true,
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  but I also have like,
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  I'm also not,
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  I mean,
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  I'm like the boyfriend,
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  so I mean,
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.000]  I'm the father figure,
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  as well,
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  but I guess I don't have the burden
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  that Marie has,
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  and that's,
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  like I could see hers,
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  she is really upset
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  over little things all the time.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  I'm like,
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  why are you getting so upset?
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  She'll fuck you.
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  Anyway,
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  we,
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  we,
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  everything was sort of going fine.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  I got a bit depressed
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  when Peggy died,
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  a very close friend of mine
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  died January 1st.
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  And now,
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  Is it?
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  No,
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  it's 2019,
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  you know,
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  but,
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  that's another story.
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  It's a good story,
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  but a long story.
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  Neil Young,
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  his wife,
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  Peggy,
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  Neil Young is a real dick,
[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  a real fucking asshole.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  When I was at the funeral,
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  he stood up there on stage,
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  it looked like he had won,
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  like Peggy had died,
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  and he got his girl,
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  his daughter back,
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  who was,
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  he was,
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  this,
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  this strange from,
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.000]  and all the money that Peggy took in divorce,
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  and he said,
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.000]  there's like,
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.000]  I won,
[30:01.000 --> 30:02.000]  I got it all back.
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  I had to leave early,
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.000]  I don't know,
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  about what I said.
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.000]  The point of that story is
[30:09.000 --> 30:10.000]  because you need to know
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.000]  that Steve,
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  so Steve Tolst,
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  okay,
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  he's an Australian,
[30:14.000 --> 30:15.000]  and he is a writer.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  He won like a second prize
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.000]  in a beauty contest,
[30:18.000 --> 30:19.000]  you know,
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.000]  like a runner-up
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  for the Booker Prize,
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.000]  but not even
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.000]  when the Booker Prize,
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  and he only did it
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.000]  because his father
[30:25.000 --> 30:26.000]  is a very well-placed guy
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  in Sydney,
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.000]  and a very wealthy family
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  of lawyers,
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.000]  and they did
[30:32.000 --> 30:33.000]  whatever they could.
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.000]  So,
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  he's sort of like,
[30:35.000 --> 30:36.000]  and I don't say
[30:36.000 --> 30:37.000]  it's just a little bit
[30:37.000 --> 30:38.000]  of the angry boyfriend,
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  he's kind of,
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  he's running the capacity,
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  he's running sort of like,
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  he's not the brightest guy around,
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  but he can fool you
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  into believing he is,
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  you know,
[30:47.000 --> 30:48.000]  and I think he did that
[30:48.000 --> 30:49.000]  to Marie for a long time,
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  and when she sort of caught on
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  what was really happening,
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.000]  she left.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  But,
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  when I met her,
[30:55.000 --> 30:56.000]  he was still emailing her
[30:56.000 --> 30:57.000]  20, 30 times a day,
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.000]  texting her,
[30:58.000 --> 30:59.000]  sorry,
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.000]  the equivalent,
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  and she thought she
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.000]  had to respond,
[31:02.000 --> 31:03.000]  and I remember
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  being in a car in like,
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.000]  2018,
[31:05.000 --> 31:06.000]  I'm like,
[31:06.000 --> 31:07.000]  why are you responding to this?
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.000]  Why are you doing this?
[31:08.000 --> 31:09.000]  Like, every time you have
[31:09.000 --> 31:10.000]  an issue where you have to
[31:10.000 --> 31:11.000]  say, oh, you're going to be fine,
[31:11.000 --> 31:12.000]  she's like,
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  I don't know,
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.000]  I just feel guilty if I don't.
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  I'm like,
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.000]  well, okay,
[31:16.000 --> 31:17.000]  we don't have to,
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  and then she was
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.000]  like, you're right,
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  I don't,
[31:20.000 --> 31:21.000]  and then she stopped,
[31:21.000 --> 31:22.000]  and that's when it all started.
[31:22.000 --> 31:23.000]  So,
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  he's a kind of guy,
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  I was telling Kim,
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.000]  would rather burn
[31:26.000 --> 31:27.000]  the world down
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.000]  than to
[31:28.000 --> 31:29.000]  allow her to leave him.
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  Okay,
[31:30.000 --> 31:31.000]  and I never met these
[31:31.000 --> 31:32.000]  attached people before.
[31:32.000 --> 31:33.000]  This is new to me,
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.000]  right?
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  Like,
[31:35.000 --> 31:36.000]  first of all,
[31:36.000 --> 31:37.000]  I'm dating a girl with a kid,
[31:37.000 --> 31:38.000]  and now there's a boyfriend,
[31:38.000 --> 31:39.000]  like,
[31:39.000 --> 31:40.000]  the kind you see in
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.000]  freaking television shows,
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  you know,
[31:42.000 --> 31:43.000]  it exists.
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  I didn't know.
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  I didn't know.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  I thought she was like,
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  I thought Marie was over exaggerating.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  I'm like,
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.000]  come on,
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.000]  can't it be that offensive?
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.000]  She shows me the best.
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  I'm like,
[31:52.000 --> 31:53.000]  wow,
[31:53.000 --> 31:54.000]  you know,
[31:54.000 --> 31:55.000]  you have to really be crazy.
[31:55.000 --> 31:56.000]  So again,
[31:56.000 --> 31:57.000]  the reason,
[31:57.000 --> 31:58.000]  what you don't know,
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  is that when they first met,
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  it was sort of normal.
[32:01.000 --> 32:03.000]  She was waiting for him to leave,
[32:03.000 --> 32:04.000]  but he stayed
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  and moved into her house.
[32:05.000 --> 32:06.000]  Then he got sick,
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  and aneurysm in his back.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  It did something to the spinal nerve,
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.000]  and L4,
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.000]  I don't know,
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.000]  I'm not out of position,
[32:13.000 --> 32:14.000]  so I don't know exactly,
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  but it severed the nerve,
[32:16.000 --> 32:17.000]  pinched the nerve.
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  It was something where it paralyzed.
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.000]  Neck down,
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  fully paralyzed.
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  She,
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  Marie is such the type where,
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  she actually wrote a letter to
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  Sarkozy saying,
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  I need your help,
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  is that Australian,
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  and he even paid for his medical bills.
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  And Sarkozy fucking responded,
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  and said,
[32:35.000 --> 32:36.000]  okay.
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.000]  Yeah,
[32:37.000 --> 32:38.000]  that's Marie.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  So Sarkozy actually paid for his bills?
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  Sarkozy paid for his bills.
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.000]  Probably started to write
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  Sarkozy for health and planning.
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.000]  Right?
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.000]  Yeah,
[32:45.000 --> 32:46.000]  what am I doing here
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.000]  when I talk to Sarkozy?
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.000]  No.
[32:48.000 --> 32:49.000]  But
[32:49.000 --> 32:50.000]  what's really weird
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  is that Steve's father
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  could have paid for it,
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  but they didn't,
[32:53.000 --> 32:54.000]  because they were that type of people.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  They can get it for free,
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  then they'll take it, right?
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  It doesn't matter that they're taking someone else's
[33:01.000 --> 33:02.000]  scholarship,
[33:02.000 --> 33:03.000]  someone else's
[33:03.000 --> 33:04.000]  fund for their thing,
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  they don't care.
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  So Marie nursed him back to health
[33:08.000 --> 33:09.000]  after a couple years,
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  and he could walk with him.
[33:10.000 --> 33:11.000]  Miracle,
[33:11.000 --> 33:12.000]  it was a 4% chance of walking,
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.000]  you walk.
[33:13.000 --> 33:14.000]  Oh no,
[33:14.000 --> 33:15.000]  sorry,
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.000]  not 4% chance.
[33:16.000 --> 33:17.000]  That was,
[33:17.000 --> 33:18.000]  that was having Marlowe's 4% chance.
[33:18.000 --> 33:19.000]  It was like a very low
[33:19.000 --> 33:20.000]  percent chance of walking,
[33:20.000 --> 33:21.000]  but he was up and walking.
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.000]  But
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  he would forever have to wear a catheter.
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  I think it costs me back,
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.000]  I'm not sure how long that lasted,
[33:27.000 --> 33:28.000]  but of course,
[33:28.000 --> 33:29.000]  the guy,
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  no hard on,
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.000]  cannot get it up,
[33:31.000 --> 33:32.000]  no sex.
[33:32.000 --> 33:33.000]  So Marie
[33:33.000 --> 33:34.000]  just was in her,
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.000]  she's very loyal,
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  and she was 22,
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  and she met him,
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  very young and naive.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  So,
[33:39.000 --> 33:40.000]  what am I doing?
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  I guess,
[33:41.000 --> 33:42.000]  can't,
[33:42.000 --> 33:43.000]  you know,
[33:43.000 --> 33:44.000]  I have to stick with this guy.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  You know,
[33:45.000 --> 33:46.000]  she did last as long as she could,
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.000]  and his mind
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  and body deteriorated further and further,
[33:49.000 --> 33:50.000]  and then she just left.
[33:50.000 --> 33:51.000]  She couldn't take it much,
[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  she left.
[33:52.000 --> 33:53.000]  Now,
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.000]  between us,
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.000]  they separated in,
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.000]  I think 2013,
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  but for the lawyers,
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  it's 2018.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  Just so you know,
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  because she's,
[34:01.000 --> 34:02.000]  you know,
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.000]  for the,
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  you know,
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.000]  I don't know any about divorce either,
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.000]  but the lawyer said,
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.000]  let's just say 2018.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  Okay,
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  so I don't know.
[34:09.000 --> 34:10.000]  So,
[34:10.000 --> 34:11.000]  when,
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  I met him for the first time,
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  he seemed,
[34:14.000 --> 34:15.000]  I mean,
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  I was like,
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000]  oh, hello,
[34:17.000 --> 34:18.000]  my name's Val,
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  I'm the guy that's fucking your wife.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  He's like,
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  ah, ha, ha,
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  very funny.
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  It was a joke,
[34:23.000 --> 34:24.000]  and he laughed,
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.000]  and he took it well.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  He did?
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  Yeah.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  He took a chance.
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.000]  I did,
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  I did.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  Everyone else laughs,
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  you know,
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  but,
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  he became more obsessive.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  The text increased
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  tremendously.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  I mean,
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  we're talking like 50 to 60,
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  answering me,
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  what are you doing?
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  I don't understand.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  And they were like,
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  really negative.
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  It's all designed to make her hurt,
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.000]  feel like shit,
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  feel guilty,
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.000]  you know,
[34:50.000 --> 34:51.000]  or feel sorry for him.
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  Every single one is designed for that.
[34:52.000 --> 34:53.000]  I printed them all out,
[34:53.000 --> 34:54.000]  gave them to the lawyer.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.000]  It's,
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  just to read them,
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  it's like weird.
[34:57.000 --> 34:58.000]  You guys,
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  it's a fun read,
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  if you ever want to,
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  if you're bored.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  I'll send it to you if you want.
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  But it's disturbing,
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  too,
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  because it's a sign of obsession,
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  and that's never going to end well,
[35:07.000 --> 35:08.000]  you know.
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  So,
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  fast forward to a bunch of stuff,
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  on April 10th,
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.000]  or,
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  sorry,
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  before April 10th,
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.000]  COVID hit,
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  and Marla had to be
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  taught home,
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.000]  homeschooled now,
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  so he had the logins
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  to the computer,
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  you know,
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  such a nightmare at first.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  It was such a nightmare.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  Oh, man, yeah.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  Trying to get him to do homework,
[35:30.000 --> 35:31.000]  and he's lying,
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  now he's lying all the time.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  And this kid,
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  he never lied.
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  He like,
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.000]  was so honest and happy,
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  he couldn't put him anywhere,
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  and he would start talking to everybody,
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  and everyone would be
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  in trance by his conversation.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  He is a smart kid,
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  he's so smart.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  But now,
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  he's lying.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  I mean,
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  why is he lying?
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  Is he trying to hide something?
[35:49.000 --> 35:50.000]  He's depressed,
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  he's something's wrong,
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  he doesn't either,
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.000]  but Marie always blames Steve,
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  no matter what,
[35:54.000 --> 35:55.000]  it's always Steve.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  And I kind of learned
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.000]  that she's,
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.000]  you know,
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  almost always right too,
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  you know,
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  because he comes,
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  it's a 50-50 custody at this point.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Sorry,
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  for a year,
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  it was 50-50 custody.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  Before that,
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  it was 80-20,
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.000]  Marie, okay?
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  But for the last year,
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  they tried 50-50.
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.000]  Steve says,
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.000]  and I have a lot of records,
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  saying I cannot take care
[36:15.000 --> 36:16.000]  of Marla for more than a week
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.000]  at a time.
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  All he does
[36:18.000 --> 36:19.000]  is he sits in the little office,
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  and he writes the books.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  He works for screenwriting
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  for some comedy TV show,
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  it's not very funny.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  Two police officers
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  are detectives in a car
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  the whole time.
[36:33.000 --> 36:34.000]  Security?
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  Something security?
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  I don't know.
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.000]  It's not that good.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's not that good.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  So that's why he's in the country.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  Not Tim and Jamie.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  I needed,
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  Marie wanted to divorce him,
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  she's been wanting him
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  for so long,
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  but she can't,
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  because,
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  but because of the visa
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.000]  that she was on,
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  she was tied to it,
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  she could not work in America,
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  and she was trying to do,
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  you know,
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  she would still
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  do some cash jobs,
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  or she'd teach French,
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  or art,
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  to the mothers,
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.000]  to go to a school called Lila,
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  it's a French,
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  for French people.
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.000]  And there's something
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  we were going on about that
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  school too,
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  you guys should be aware of.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  Very,
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  something's off.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  But,
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  what was I saying?
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  Sorry,
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  you know that Lila,
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  French school,
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  and it brought up,
[37:27.000 --> 37:28.000]  80, 20, 50, 50.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  Yeah, the custody,
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  that's right.
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.000]  Yeah.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  And then COVID.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  That's right.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  Yeah, she's,
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  well, now Marie works in rehab.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  She works at arts,
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  which is another crazy thing
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  about DCFS.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.000]  She works in rehab,
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  which is randomly drug tested
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  every week, right?
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  So,
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  but I'll get to that.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  She teaches art therapy
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  to all these drug addicts.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  She's able to work,
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  and Marla's able to work,
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  and everything's going fine,
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  and then Steve,
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  one day, comes over,
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  because we're a day late,
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  or there was some misinterpretation,
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.000]  and this,
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  something happened,
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  someone didn't communicate
[38:06.000 --> 38:07.000]  with someone about Marla,
[38:07.000 --> 38:08.000]  one who was supposed to be picked up.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  Steve knows to never come
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  by place, or loft.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  He knows to never come by,
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  and we don't go to his place either.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  It's an unspoken rule.
[38:17.000 --> 38:18.000]  He comes over,
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  and he,
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  he's wearing a mask
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  that was white,
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  but he drew,
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  and this was really weird,
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  I thought, he drew teeth.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  He's a 50 year old man,
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  okay, and he drew teeth
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  on the mask.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  He came over,
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  and I had a security camera,
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  so I had the whole thing on tape.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  It was wonderful,
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  this is fucking hilarious.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  But,
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  he goes,
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  he comes over,
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  and you know,
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  you see pedestrians throw by,
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  and they're just normal people,
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  when you can see someone going for a run,
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  and someone just walking the dog,
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  but then you see a slow,
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  perambling,
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  what the hell is this?
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  And it's, of course, Steve.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  I mean, I don't know if he's high,
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  I don't know what the fuck's going on with this guy.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  But he makes it to the front door,
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  he knocks,
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  he blows up his one sleeve,
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  he's preparing for something, obviously.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  And,
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  no, I don't,
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  I don't really see this in retrospect.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  At the time,
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  I'm upstairs having a joke
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  and laughing with Marla and Marie.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Like, we're like on the floor laughing
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  about word Al Jankiewicz,
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  because Yoda,
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  you know what I'm saying, Yoda?
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Why Yoda?
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Yoda is great.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  But Marla just learned it,
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  so he was laughing.
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  And then the door is,
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  someone's knocking the door,
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  and it's around five o'clock, I remember,
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  because that's when Steve's always on time,
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  perfectly.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  And I'm like,
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  what the fuck?
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  So I said,
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  I'll go check,
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  and I open the door,
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  and I see Steve,
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  and Steve goes,
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  Marla,
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  Marla,
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  he starts screaming for Marla.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  Marie is so freaked out,
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  she takes Marla,
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  and she hides in the bathroom.
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  It's the only door in the loft as a lock,
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  and it's like,
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  just the furthest,
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  it's the furthest from the front door,
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  actually, too.
[39:47.000 --> 39:48.000]  And I was like,
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  wow,
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  like she really,
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  she was fucking scared.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  And I don't want her scared,
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  it's just like a little,
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  you know,
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  puny guy can barely walk,
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  so I,
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  but he starts,
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  he says,
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.000]  I want him to,
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  I'm here to pick up Marla,
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  and I say,
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  no, you're not,
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  you cannot be here,
[40:03.000 --> 40:04.000]  you're not supposed to be here.
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  What are you doing here?
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  You gotta go.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  No, I'm picking up Marla,
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  it's five o'clock,
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  look, just,
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  let me put on some shoes,
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  and some socks,
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  and a jacket,
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  and I was,
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  I wasn't fully dressed,
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  I was like,
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  sweatpants,
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  and shirt.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  Let me come outside,
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  and I'll,
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  and I'll talk to you about it.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  He said,
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  well,
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  there's not much to talk about,
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  but okay,
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  so he goes back,
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  I close the door,
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  and now,
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  what I learned later,
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  is when I closed the door,
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  he whipped out his cell phone,
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  and he opened up an app,
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  and he starts flipping through porn.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Normal, right?
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  No, not,
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  very odd behavior.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  I was like,
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  what the fuck,
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  but it wasn't like porn porn,
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  it was like dating site porn,
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  with the couples.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  It was fucking weird,
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  right?
[40:49.000 --> 40:50.000]  To come over to the house,
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  not gonna be angry at me,
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  because he was kind of like,
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  his voice was raised,
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  I'm telling you,
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  like a really brief version,
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  but then just like,
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  not chill out,
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  like,
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  it was very strange.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  I tell him,
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  look, it's okay,
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  I'm gonna handle it,
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  and Marla says,
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  you know what,
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  my dad,
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  he just needs to be reassured,
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  and Marla's like,
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  no, no, no,
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  no reassuring,
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  just stay here with me in the bathtub,
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  and like,
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  you guys are just gonna be fine,
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  I'm just gonna talk to him,
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  and you'll leave.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  So I get dressed,
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  I open the door,
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  and the door opens up this way,
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  and then as my door,
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  as the door's open,
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  he comes in,
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  shoulder,
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  right here,
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  to break my,
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  my,
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  my grip,
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  on the door,
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  but I,
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  he's not that strong,
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  so I,
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  he doesn't break my grip,
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  he just makes me upset,
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  so I grab,
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  and I pull him out,
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  and he doesn't quite hit the car,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  his first reaction is,
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  oh, my back,
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  right,
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  like a,
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  sort of like a,
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  childish thing,
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  very strange,
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  for a 50-year-old man,
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.000]  and I said,
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  oh, shut the fuck up,
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  and now you can hear me,
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  the profanity's out,
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  I'm like,
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  are you stupid,
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  are you that stupid,
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  I mean,
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  to fight a,
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  you know,
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  and I said,
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  this is California,
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  this is,
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  you know,
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  good thing I'm not like California,
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  because,
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  you know,
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  they carry guns,
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  like,
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  people can have guns,
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  I don't even have a gun,
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  you know,
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  things like this,
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  and then he,
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  he,
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  I said,
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  look,
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  this is on camera,
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.000]  then he's like,
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  you just lost,
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  you just lost the divorce,
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  you just lost everything,
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  you fucked up man,
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  you gotta go now,
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  he's like,
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  I'm not leaving,
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  so,
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  short version is,
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  I throw him out to the sidewalk,
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  I push him until he's in the,
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  it's still private property,
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  but I just sort of say,
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  now you're in the streets,
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  you can leave us alone though,
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  and I tell you,
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  I will,
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  and I made him a promise,
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  I will bring Marlo out,
[42:34.000 --> 42:35.000]  you can say hello to Marlo,
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  I will bring him out,
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  and you have my word on that,
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  but you have to be by your car,
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  you cannot be on our property,
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  and you can agree to do it,
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  go to his car,
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  so Marlo,
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  please do me a favor,
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  can you come out with me,
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  but just don't let go of my hand,
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  and Marlo says,
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  okay,
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  and he does not let go of my hand
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  all the time,
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  because I know he's gonna try and steal him,
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  and he tried twice,
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  the whole time,
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  I recorded everything on my phone,
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  it's all,
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  it's all there,
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  and the video camera,
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  so when that incident occurred,
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.000]  Marie and I sat down and talked,
[43:05.000 --> 43:06.000]  and she said,
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  the deterioration has gone severe,
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  this is a line that's crossed,
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  and Marie's in the middle of the forest,
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  and to cross this line,
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  in the middle of the forest,
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  is very stupid,
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  okay,
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  so that means the brain has deteriorated
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  further than we even imagined,
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  so Marie is very concerned,
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  and she's like,
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  I'm not giving Marlo back down,
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  so she holds on to Marlo
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  for the last five months,
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  so we had Marlo,
[43:35.000 --> 43:36.000]  and we were like,
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  it's fun to have like,
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  now we're like a family,
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  for five months,
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  we found Marlo,
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  you know,
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  we all got to know each other,
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  and Marlo,
[43:44.000 --> 43:45.000]  you know,
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.000]  it's really funny,
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  it was nice.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  How long have you been living with Marlo?
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  Two and a half years now,
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.000]  but you know,
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  you see Marlo every other week.
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  Like five months?
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  Yeah, yeah,
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  it was a lot at first,
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.000]  especially for me,
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.000]  but I got used to it,
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.000]  it wasn't,
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  it wasn't so,
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  you know,
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  I thought it was going to be even worse for me,
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.000]  but you know,
[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  expect the worst.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.000]  It's a good day,
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  it could go any way.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  Yeah, it's true, it's true,
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.000]  but you know,
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.000]  and we'd see Steven,
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  and the fear,
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  see the fear and the lying,
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  and we'd try to teach him to not lie,
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  like he starts lying,
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  like he talks,
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  I said,
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  Marlo,
[44:23.000 --> 44:24.000]  why are these lies?
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  And we know where they come from,
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  because Steve,
[44:26.000 --> 44:27.000]  this is how Steve talks,
[44:27.000 --> 44:28.000]  he lies constantly,
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  he's always,
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  he's always,
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  and we felt like we made some progress,
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  you know,
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.000]  he was,
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  he had more self-confidence,
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  like he was afraid of dancing,
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.000]  and eight year old,
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  afraid of dancing,
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.000]  because he's self-conscious,
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.000]  he's fucking silly,
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  so we started dancing more
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  to make him less self-conscious,
[44:43.000 --> 44:44.000]  and we did these kung fu outfits,
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  so we pretended we were kung fu fighting,
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  you know,
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  saw him kung fu fighting,
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  he loves it,
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  so his confidence is back,
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  he's happy,
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  and he fucking said to me,
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  three days before this,
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  all went to shit,
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  he said,
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  well,
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  I wish you were my father,
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  he said to me,
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  and it broke my heart,
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  it broke my heart,
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  I mean,
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  I felt great and warm,
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.000]  but it also broke my heart,
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  you know,
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  and I know that feeling,
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  because I grew up in foster care,
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  you know,
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.000]  I know that feeling,
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  I've been to two different,
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  different families,
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  and different mothers,
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.000]  and different fathers,
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.000]  I had two brothers once in foster care,
[45:16.000 --> 45:17.000]  you know,
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.000]  you know, home.
[45:18.000 --> 45:19.000]  You remember it pretty well?
[45:19.000 --> 45:20.000]  Yeah, yeah,
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  and one I don't,
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  two I remember pretty well,
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  the last one I remember very well,
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  because there was,
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  there wasn't the horrible system
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  that you hear about,
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  this is a nice happy Jewish family,
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  a loving family,
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  they're like good people,
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  you know,
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  even in Chicago,
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  in Cook County,
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  Carol and Larry Payless,
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  I remember,
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  it's not like the shoe store,
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.000]  it's Payless,
[45:43.000 --> 45:44.000]  I said,
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  oh,
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.000]  sometimes for a different climate,
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  it's a lot like a craft shoe,
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.000]  I see.
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  Yeah,
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  I got lucky,
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.000]  I got lucky,
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  because I heard the stories,
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  you know,
[45:54.000 --> 45:55.000]  so,
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  it's still,
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  it's still in the middle, yeah.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  No, nothing,
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  there's fighting,
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  and Steve is using this now,
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  as a tool in the divorce,
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  everything that just happened is,
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  weaponizing DCFS,
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  he just did it,
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  and it forgot it limited capacity,
[46:17.000 --> 46:18.000]  I know that it wasn't him,
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  it's gotta be the lawyers,
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  his lawyers are pretty smart,
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  because he's got money,
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  he's got like seven lawyers,
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  you know,
[46:24.000 --> 46:25.000]  you have one guy
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  that barely leaves his office,
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  we do most of the work,
[46:28.000 --> 46:29.000]  Marie and I.
[46:30.000 --> 46:31.000]  Anyway,
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  so Marie and I are like,
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  we've gone through two cleaning ladies,
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  one live in the brewery,
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  and one girl,
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  she's great,
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  she was like too cute for me,
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  because,
[46:44.000 --> 46:45.000]  why is she doing it?
[46:45.000 --> 46:46.000]  Marie,
[46:46.000 --> 46:47.000]  why is she doing it?
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  I'm not staring at her,
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  why does she have to worry
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.000]  about these tight pants?
[46:50.000 --> 46:51.000]  I'm like,
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  no, I didn't ask her,
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  it's not my fault,
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.000]  and then one day,
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  she's like,
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.000]  you know what,
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  I don't want to clean,
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  I want to sing,
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.000]  I want to make music,
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.000]  I'm like, okay,
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.000]  go make some music,
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  so she quit,
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  so we start cleaning,
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.000]  and in Richard,
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.000]  you know,
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  Marla gets in trouble,
[47:06.000 --> 47:07.000]  we're like,
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  oh,
[47:08.000 --> 47:09.000]  you gotta do the dishes,
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  you know,
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.000]  you have to wipe and clean,
[47:11.000 --> 47:12.000]  and he doesn't like that either,
[47:12.000 --> 47:13.000]  so we thought,
[47:13.000 --> 47:14.000]  why not do,
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  get a nanny slash,
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  a housekeeper,
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  okay,
[47:17.000 --> 47:18.000]  somebody can do both,
[47:18.000 --> 47:19.000]  watch Marla,
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  we can have some time alone,
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  and they can clean the fucking house.
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  So we do put the feelers out,
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  Marie puts them out
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  on some next door,
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  it's a couple other websites.
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  I ask everybody,
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  I know,
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  oh,
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  sorry,
[47:34.000 --> 47:35.000]  I forgot,
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.000]  I almost forgot Patel.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  Patel is a labor,
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  one,
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  two,
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  three,
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  three doors down,
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  four doors down,
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  I thought she'd just moved in,
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  in like July,
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  or sorry,
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  mid June,
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  I'd never seen her before,
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.000]  but all of a sudden,
[47:50.000 --> 47:51.000]  she's there,
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  everywhere,
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  very loud and boisterous,
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  and she,
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  outside,
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  look,
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  at our place,
[47:57.000 --> 47:58.000]  there's a little park
[47:58.000 --> 47:59.000]  across the way,
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  and Marla always hangs out there,
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  and so everyone,
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.000]  sort of,
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  the brewery,
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  the brewery,
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  artist loft,
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  it's like an artist community,
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  so it's a campus,
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  more or less,
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  and it's just 300 lofts,
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  with a whole bunch of it,
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  with six or 900 people in it,
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  it's a different spot,
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  so everyone hangs out
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.000]  in the sort of park areas,
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  where we are,
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  because it's closest to us.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  She says,
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  she saw him in the park,
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  and she showed him his jewelry,
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  and he said,
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  oh, I want to make this,
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  just some jewelry,
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  and I was like,
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  you want to make crystal jewelry?
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  He's like,
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  yes,
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  I want to make crystal jewelry.
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  Like, okay, Marla,
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  you can make some crystal jewelry.
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  So we take him over there,
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  and she seems sane, right?
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  I know something's off,
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  you know,
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  I mean,
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  I can sense it,
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  I know something's wrong,
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  but I figure maybe this is like,
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  she's in a,
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  just got her parents' house,
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  or she's moving,
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  trying to make her life,
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  or start a new world.
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  I mean,
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  there's no way she's making money
[48:54.000 --> 48:55.000]  selling crystal jewelry, okay?
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  It's,
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  first of all,
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  it's shitty jewelry,
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  no one's buying it,
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  and it's way too expensive.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  It's not $4,500 a month,
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  on that place.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  I know what she's paying too.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  So,
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  I figure there's some parents
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  paying for it,
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  or something,
[49:07.000 --> 49:08.000]  or maybe a brother,
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  definitely not a sugar daddy type,
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  because she's the most unattractive
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  woman I've ever seen.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  Like,
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  you see her,
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  and you're like,
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  whoa,
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  okay,
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  and it's unfortunate for her,
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  but it is true.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  So,
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  anyway,
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.000]  she,
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  we brought her over,
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  and we approved
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  for like two hours a day.
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.000]  We thought that couldn't be,
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  literally,
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  you can walk in 10 seconds
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  and get to her house,
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  or something.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  It's like,
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  there's no danger,
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  you know?
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  And Miles said,
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  please, please,
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  can I have that crystal jewelry, please?
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  Okay,
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  yes,
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  and we get two hours to ourselves now.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  So,
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  we're happy.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  So,
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  for five days,
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  and he makes crystal jewelry.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  He comes back for lunch.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  He eats with us.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  Sometimes,
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  Marie brings them lunch.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  Sometimes,
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  I'll go over there
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  and just see what's going on.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  Everything's friendly and copicetic.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  You can always,
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  she's no problem.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  She's a talker.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  She likes to jab her
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  about herself.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  She will not ask you anything
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  about how you are,
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  where you're from,
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  or anything.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  She'll just tell you everything
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  she knows about everybody.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  Gossip,
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  gossip, gossip.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  People live like that.
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  Yeah,
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  yeah.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  It's,
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  well,
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  it's because that's what she thinks
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  her value is,
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  and that's why we're,
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  you know,
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.000]  it's very,
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  I understand it,
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  but,
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  but I mentioned,
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  Marlo,
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  like,
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  making crafts.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  Anything,
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.000]  and we found someone,
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  like,
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  I'll talk to him, too.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  And that was like,
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  you know,
[50:28.000 --> 50:29.000]  it was so,
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  it was interesting,
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.000]  but he loved it.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  And he even said,
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  down,
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  down Marlo,
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  bye,
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  have you liked my whole life?
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  I've already made crystal jewelry.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Your whole life,
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  figures on.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  He's like,
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  it's a huge revelation,
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  yeah.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  All right, Marlo,
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  you go for it.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  Of course,
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  he got bored with it,
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  you know,
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  four days later.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  But on Saturday,
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  Patil decided to sell the jewelry
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  that she had been making with Marlo.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  So,
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  they go and they set up
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  a thing in the park,
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.000]  like,
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  just a table,
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  and all the people from
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  the community come over
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  and they see Marlo,
[51:00.000 --> 51:01.000]  and he's fucking adorable,
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  selling jewelry,
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  so people buy jewelry.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  Of course,
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  I buy most of it,
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  you know,
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  so,
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  and I have to buy some Patil's jewelry, too,
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  because it looks bad,
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  but she's not really selling any.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  So,
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  I buy some of her,
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  so I spend like 250 bucks
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  on this useless jewelry
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  that's already broken,
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.000]  right?
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  Um,
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  Steve is $250.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  I don't know.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  No,
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  no,
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.000]  I've not,
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  but it's like 30 pieces,
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  you know,
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  it's ridiculous.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  Yeah,
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  you don't need it,
[51:28.000 --> 51:29.000]  trust me.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  It's not necessary.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.000]  But,
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  but Steve,
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  I invite Steve,
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  because I'm a nice guy.
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  So,
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  I'm like,
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.000]  Steve would like to see this.
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  His son is making money
[51:38.000 --> 51:39.000]  on something he created
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  on his own.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  He's better than with his first $20.
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  So,
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  he's ever earned.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  Steve would like to see this.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  I think it would be a good idea.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  And Marie's like,
[51:46.000 --> 51:47.000]  no.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  I say,
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  come on,
[51:49.000 --> 51:50.000]  let him,
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.000]  he's got to,
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  he'll enjoy this.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  Because we give him visits every week
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.000]  or whenever he wants to,
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.000]  well,
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  not whenever,
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.000]  basically once a week,
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  but whenever he wants to talk tomorrow,
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  we let him talk,
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.000]  unless tomorrow does not want to talk
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  and not as often.
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  And he does not want to accept that.
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  Um,
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  so,
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  I invite him over
[52:05.000 --> 52:06.000]  and he comes over
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  and,
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  um,
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  and,
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  oh, shit.
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  Um,
[52:14.000 --> 52:15.000]  I forgot I'm working today too,
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  but it's okay.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  I put on an option
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  because I don't have to worry about it
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  till next week.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  Um,
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  so,
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  he comes over
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.000]  and he's
[52:24.000 --> 52:25.000]  instantly in the mood changes.
[52:25.000 --> 52:26.000]  You'll,
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  if you ever meet him,
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  you'll see for yourself.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  You know,
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.000]  it's one of those people,
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  everything's sort of down,
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  now I'm depressing
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  and self-conscious.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  You know,
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  because that's what he,
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  that's what he emulates.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  Um,
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  he seems somewhat immune
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.000]  to it right now,
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  but he won't be in the future.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  I know it.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  I could see it happen.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  Um,
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  he asked Patille
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  for her number.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  Steve.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  Steve does.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  Which I thought was strange.
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  Um,
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  but not too strange.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  Marie said
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  he never asked people
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  for her number.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  This is not a good idea.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  Okay.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  And I said,
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  well,
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  I'll trust you.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  Um,
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  later that night,
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  Patille,
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  uh,
[53:06.000 --> 53:07.000]  Marie and I are,
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  uh, walking.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  For some reason,
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  we didn't walk to the,
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  now we weren't doing the laundry,
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  we had to walk past the park.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  I can't remember why.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  Um,
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  and we see Patille
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  and three other girls
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.000]  sitting in the park
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  by candlelight talking.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  And I go,
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  hey,
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  nice to see you guys.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  We're going back,
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  going to bed,
[53:23.000 --> 53:24.000]  cause I had to wake up early
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  for some reason.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  Um,
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  I can't remember why.
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  I had to wake up early.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  I was upset at Marie
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.000]  for making me stay up so late.
[53:30.000 --> 53:31.000]  You know,
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  I was like,
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  I had to,
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  he promised me
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  to get to bed before,
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  and I had to do extra shit
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.000]  for something.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  So she says,
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  okay,
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  don't worry,
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  let's just have a quick talk
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  with Patille
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  and talk about the day.
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  So,
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  you know,
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  okay,
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  fine.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  But that quick talk with Patille
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  means she's going to talk
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  to you at you for an hour.
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  You know,
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  and of course,
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  I'm,
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  and Marielett does it,
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  so I'm the one that says,
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  okay,
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  enough,
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  I've got to go to sleep.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  Right?
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  I'm going to have to be the asshole.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  So I say,
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  okay, fine.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  She comes into our place
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  for the first time.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  In our entrance living room, we have a loft, there's an upstairs, back room, there's a whole bunch of fucking space.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  And I'm like, okay, great, let's just go outside and smoke a cigarette and have a go.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  She says, okay.
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.000]  Go outside and we're underneath now my surveillance camera, okay?
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  And I have a 30-day fucking break point.
[54:27.000 --> 54:36.000]  Marie is typing a letter now to send to LogiCircle to get this fucking tape because this will change everything.
[54:36.000 --> 54:43.000]  Patille and we're smoking a cigarette and Patille goes on a tirade about how much she sees evil in Steve.
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  I looked in his eyes and all I saw was pure evil.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  You know, like they're really dramatic.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  She's like really, she gets in my face like, I don't really, I got in his eyes and I saw nothing.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  It was blank. It was evil.
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.000]  I said, no, Patille, what you saw was emptiness. There's just nothing in there.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  He's not very smart.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  She was, no, no, no, it was evil.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  This was our conversation for like a good 15 minutes, right?
[55:09.000 --> 55:17.000]  So not only are we confident that Patille hates Steve, you know, that she's not going to sell us out or do anything stupid.
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  We were like, okay, she's, you know, we believe her.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  But, you know, I don't realize and I'm stupid because I forgot this is classic bipolar.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  That's what I picked up on.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  This woman is fucking classic bipolar.
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.000]  And I've seen this so many times and I was dumb to not listen to my instinct that first day when I knew something was wrong.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  I didn't know what it was.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  I didn't think about it hard enough.
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  I think that's where I fucked up because that's what she is.
[55:42.000 --> 55:48.000]  And now I see it because they flip one extreme to the next and that's exactly what happened.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  Now in her report, she says she reached out to Steve via Instagram.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  Not true.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  They have, she's got a phone number.
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  Okay.
[55:56.000 --> 56:05.000]  She wrote a report because we stopped seeing her after this because also there was something she was fucking dancing naked with Marlowe, supposedly.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  Marlowe says she was dancing, but she may or may or not have been naked.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  So Marlowe doesn't really understand.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  He's going either way.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  Right.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  So I don't know what that means with Marlowe, but I don't like it.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  He said he felt uncomfortable.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  He tried not to look.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  All he said, all I wanted to do was finish making the jewelry and she wanted to dance.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  So that was enough for us to think this is enough of this.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  Okay.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  We put him in camp the next day.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  He goes to a beach day camp for the next two weeks.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  Now we don't hear from Patel for a long time.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.000]  We think something's wrong.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  Why is she like say hello?
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  We don't see because she's not voice person friendly.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  Then we get hit with Steve's lawyers.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  Like a dossier.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  They send like a thing saying here are the witness statements I have.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  Why yours is a terrible person.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  Here's why I'm great.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  Not quite enough to do.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  It's like an aggregate.
[57:01.000 --> 57:08.000]  Yeah, summary of what she wanted and other people saying that me is a terrible person.
[57:08.000 --> 57:20.000]  I want to say July 30th approximately July 30th.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  So we see this and what we read is so fucking outrageously crazy.
[57:27.000 --> 57:37.000]  She said that Marlowe is walking around without a shirt barefoot and is combing through garbage for fucking food.
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  Seriously.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  He's going through dumpster for food.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  And he says Marie is doing the same thing.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  Or sorry, she says Marie is doing the same thing.
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.000]  And then she says that Marie is walking around itching and scratching with sores all over her body.
[57:49.000 --> 57:50.000]  A classic junkie.
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.000]  She named every single drug in the world from fucking crystal meth that PCP did.
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  Some exotic crazy shit.
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  You remember in the heart of, you know.
[58:00.000 --> 58:06.000]  She says that there is a secret hidden room in her loft where all the drugs are stored in the paraphernalia.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  Okay.
[58:07.000 --> 58:16.000]  She says I have 40, I'm not exaggerating, 40 to 50 cell phones scattered on the tables.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  Okay.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  Not fucking exaggerating.
[58:20.000 --> 58:21.000]  And it's even worse.
[58:21.000 --> 58:22.000]  They're worse crazy shit.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  But those are the ones I remember right now.
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.000]  And we're like what the fuck.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  You know, and immediately I think that Steve paid her.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  He had to pay her.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  But this is before I figured out the bipolar thing.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  What is the lawyer asking for?
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  They want nothing.
[58:40.000 --> 58:41.000]  The lawyer said nothing.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  This is like a tactic.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  At this point you guys are full custody.
[58:47.000 --> 58:51.000]  Well, see the custody arrangement as far as I understand it.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  Again, I'm not a lawyer and I've never been through it.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  But since they're still married they both have equal rights to Marla.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  But no one has any, there are no rules set.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  So it was a verbal agreement to say 50-50 for a year.
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  So when Marie said no 50-50 it was perfectly legal for her to do that.
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.000]  And then she felt bad and she thought well maybe I should give him to,
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  and also we could want it some time alone after a couple months or like,
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  maybe we should give him to Steve for like a month,
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  or sorry, for a week.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  And then our lawyer said no.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  Because there was no rule to stop him from keeping Marla.
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  You know, just as you did he can do the same.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  So we're like okay, so we keep him.
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  So when we see this thing from Utila it just freaks us out.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  Like what the fuck.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  And then DCFS comes over.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  And I never heard of DCFS.
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  I don't know what the acronym stood for.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  I'm sure I was visited by them as a child.
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  Because it seems like I remember something.
[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  I did have a social worker I remember.
[59:50.000 --> 59:54.000]  But the first woman that came over was named Priscilla.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  And she was very nice.
[59:56.000 --> 59:59.000]  She came over and she, I let her in which is stupid.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  And I realized now you should never let them in if they ever come to your house.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  It's a thing you can take.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  They can never take away a child if you don't let them in.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  That's what I was told by Laura.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  But she came in.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  She viewed the house.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It was safe.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  It was loving.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  It was fun.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It was a good fucking home.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  And she reported that.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Okay.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Now Marie said to her in her interview that there was an incident that she was worried about.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  And I remember very well.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  We came home from shopping one day.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  And Marlo just starts telling us like a confession.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  This crazy story about touching penises at the Mark and Bobax house.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  These people that sort of turned on Marie.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  They were friends of Marie.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  And then some reason they were not.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  They just turned and then chose Steve's side.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Because people would need divorce.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  People would pick sides.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  It's shitty.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  People are fucking shitty.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  You call someone a friend.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  I mean, it really hurt her.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  It really hurt her.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  And the things they said were so fucking ridiculous and stupid.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Anyway, it's the...
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  What was the point of that?
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Sorry.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  I need some more coffee.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  I'm talking too much about coffee.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Okay.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  So what was it just before that?
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Oh, DCLA.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  So what comes to the house?
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  She says, are you willing to take drugs to us?
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  And we say, yes, you're willing to take drugs to us.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Great.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  We don't hear back from her for about three or four days.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Actually, we've never heard back from her.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  That was the last we saw at Priscilla.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  Next thing we know, police are at the door.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  This is actually the second time police came.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  They came before Priscilla came.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  And then they came.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Then Priscilla and then the police came again.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  And then...
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  No, this is Sabah Abta.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  And Erasmo...
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Aguilera.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Aguilera.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Not Aguilera, but Aguilera without the A.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Those are not the police?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Those are not the police.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  These are more DCFS.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  DCFS?
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Yeah.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  And now it's 10.30 at night and they're coming knocking door at 10.30 at night.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  And so, Marie's not home.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  She's at Amy's.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And she's all under your camera.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  She'll put it on YouTube or something like that.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  And they are...
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  You know, first they wake up Marlon.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  They're banging on the door.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  And Marlon was asleep.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  I was asleep.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Because I woke up fucking early to the trade options.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  You know, like 6 o'clock, 6.30.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  The market's open at 6.30.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  I have to be awake and ready at 6.30 a.m.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  So, you know, I'm half asleep.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And Marlon's like,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Someone's at the door.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Someone's at the door.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  I'm like, Marlon, why aren't you asleep?
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  You're supposed to be asleep.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  They woke me up.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  They woke me up.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  It's okay.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  So I go out and I open the door.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  And I see...
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  And I say, where's DCFS?
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  We're going to talk to you.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  I'm like, I just spoke to you guys.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  You were just here, you know?
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  And he's like, well, you got another call.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  And I'm like, fucking...
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  And I know it's Patel calling every day.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Patel and Steve's together calling every day.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Just to fuck with us.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  You see where they can get.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  I know it.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  You know?
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And they know it too.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  So I'm like, you know, I'm just sort of sick of it.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I don't really want to do this anymore.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  But I talk to them.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  We have a conversation.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  I'm very friendly.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  You know, I'm not...
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  I don't give them any shit.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And they just...
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  I don't remember legally if they...
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  If I invited them or they just walked in the house.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  So they ended up getting in the house.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  I don't remember saying, yeah, go ahead, please.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Come in for another round.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  But they did.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  And they did the rounds.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  And we joked and we laughed.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  Now, here's...
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  No.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  This is where I...
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  We broke down.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  Marie and I have been doing this for three days.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Like, nonstop.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  Working on this thing that you guys sent.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  You know, breaking every single word by word,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  every line by line.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Where the lies are and what we can prove.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  We have documentary evidence for it when we don't.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Right?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  For example, she says, I knocked on the door
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  and took about ten minutes to come to the door.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  It took two minutes and thirty-two seconds.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  Okay?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  Two minutes and thirty-two fucking seconds.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  She says, we went through the house.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  There was no food in the refrigerator.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  It was scarce.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  We had just ordered about three hundred and fifty-four hundred dollars
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  from Amazon delivery.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Fresh, direct.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  To come fucking two guys full of...
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  car full of food.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  It was overflowing.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  We made jokes.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  I joked them.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  I said, look, ha!
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Guess you can't say where you're going.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  So we're starving him.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  And we all laughed about it.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  In the report, it says, scarce.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Those are just, like, too little things.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  No, I'm not even getting into the big ones.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  It was delivered the next day.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  No, it was there.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  It was already there.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  The night before, we had got ordered it.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And we had packed up the fridge and the pantries.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  All right?
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  It was like, what the fuck?
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  We couldn't believe what we were reading.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  And if you read that thing, the first fourteen, fifteen pages are like,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  okay, fine.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  So it's normal.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  Nothing's wrong here.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  And then we become, like, the worst people you've ever heard.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  It's like fucking crazy shit.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  And somehow, I don't give her the number.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  She has Tim's number.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  How the fuck does she get Tim's number?
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  And she says, and there's a little note at the end,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  because she's trying to discredit me as much as she can.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  And you can see that it's really hard.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Worse than David Enridge did at The New York Times.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Like, really come after me.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  But I don't understand.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  I'm what I did to anger her.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  I have a recording, because I've learned to record pretty much everything.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  You know, it's smart, because no way people can fuck with you.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  And another question, why?
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  Like, I am.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  I'm joking.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  I'm just going to steal it from your cloud later.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  But what was I saying?
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  I recorded her saying, well, obviously, you know, the house is great.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  Obviously, Marlo loves you and you love Marlo.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  It's not, you know, you guys are great.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Just, we want you to take a drug test, and that's it.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  And I'm like, okay, that's it.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  I agreed.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  And then I said, and then there's another phone call later,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  because the next day, four police officers came.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  And that's where I was just, I had enough.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  I'm like, look, more fucking police officers.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  Ed, this is the fourth day in a row, and you're still doing this.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  At what point is this harassment?
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  This is like a few weeks ago.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Yeah.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  Oh, this is much, what's today the 12th?
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  So today, yeah, we're in August now.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  We're in August.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  I was looking at the footage last night again.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  It was July 29th.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  This must be the 30th now.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  30th or August 1st, right around there.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Because the police came the next day, so it must be the 30th.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  How many days are in July?
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  July 31.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  So it's 30th or 31st.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  I didn't even know.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  I didn't even know.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  I had zero ideas when I asked.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  So, yeah.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  So all of this stuff that's happening,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  is that what was court on, what was it, on Monday?
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  No, no, no.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  It gets worse.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  It gets worse when you get to what happens on Sunday.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  So I'm like, I say, Savva, look,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  and I read her this email.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  I said, look, nothing personal against you.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  You seem like a good person.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  I just, I'm tired of everyone of you guys believing this woman
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  and accepting this as fact and not even investigating the caller.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  Clearly, this woman is out of her mind.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  And how can you not delineate saying from insane,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  I think that's your job, but I didn't say it like that.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  I said it very kindly.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  I have a copy of it.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  I supported you.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  And I said, look, I'm just going to say we'll do the drug test,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  but that's it.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  We're going to put our foot down.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  We're not going to do anything else after the drug test.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  All right.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  We're just going to, we're not going to, we're going to stop.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  So you tell us what the next move is and we will oblige.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  And that I can quote.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  I mean, I said that tell us what the next move is
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  and we will oblige.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  That's a quote, right?
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  And then I didn't hear from her.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  And then Tuesday of that week, we interviewed a clean lady.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  She came to us from, see, I still think Patel sent her this woman
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  because I asked Patel, do you know anyone that it will clean and babysit?
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  Because I feel bad that you, I don't want you to think
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  we're sending Marla over to your place to babysit.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  Okay.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  So I was trying to overcompensate by saying,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  please give me the name and number of a fucking babysitter.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  You know, so that way she wouldn't think that.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  You know, so I still suspect it came from her,
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  but Marie thinks it came from somebody else.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  So I don't know.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  But she called us and said, I heard you're looking for a babysitter.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  And I said, yes, we are, but also a cleaning lady too.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  Like you need to be able to clean.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  So she says, I can do that.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  And so we meet her on Tuesday.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  I honestly have no memory of this meeting.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  But Marie says we met on Tuesday.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  I don't know.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  I don't remember it.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  I mean, briefly, I remember saying, okay, thank you, shaking a hand.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  But I don't know, maybe because I didn't sleep much the night before.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Cause I mean, it's really weird when you don't sleep, you know,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  and then, you know, cause I'll take a nap at like 130 when the market closes.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  And then my mind will refresh itself.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  But sometimes I don't get that nap.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  So, but Marie showed me and she said, look, right here,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  you can see the text between Lori and us.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  She was here on Tuesday.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  So she went back home and she came back on Friday.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  And that was her first day.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  She worked Friday and she was good.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  And we paid her 80 bucks in the center on Saturday.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  She comes back, but she comes late.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  Okay.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  She is like very late.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  And she says, I went to the dentist and had an abscess.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  And she showed pictures to prove it that she was at the dentist.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I said, okay, fine.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  So she does all the cleanser of the kitchen,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  does all the dishes and does the sheets, half the sheets of laundry.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  It takes Marla with her.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  One interesting thing happened.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  Marla was freaked out in the laundry room.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  And he said to his mom and friends that she,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  Lori turned white and really white.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  And he thought she was going to die.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  This is Marla.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  So he was very scared for her.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  And we sat her down.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  We asked her, are you okay?
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  She said, I'm fine.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  I'm fine.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  It's a COPD she has.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  It's called, it's some sort of pulmonary thing.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  I don't really know.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  Apparently.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Yes.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  Apparently she has machines at home.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  She has a machine, like a little machine that helps her breathe.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  Which I'm like, okay.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  And she had a bunch of these things.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  The inhaler.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  And it's strange.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Everyone has an inhaler.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  She knows, but there's a different looking one.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  It's very odd.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  And it has the date and a wheel.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  So I don't know that much about that one.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  She doesn't want to go home.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  Okay.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  She's like 60 years old, mid 60s actually.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Found out how old she was.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  She was born in 1960.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  So she's exactly 60 years.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  And then the reason I did that math really quick is because I already knew the answer.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Okay.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  I knew the answer.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So she starts crying.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  At first it was a laugh.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  I heard them both laughing upstairs and I said, what's so funny?
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  What's the joke?
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  I want to know the joke.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  And I go, oh, you won't get it.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  You're a man.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  I'm like, oh, okay, fine.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  And then I go to the bathroom and then I come out and the crying turned to sobbing.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Severe fucking sobbing.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  She was hugging Marie and Marie looked at me like, you know, she also gave me like the
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  go away.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  It's a girl thing.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  You're not going to let me handle it.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  It's okay.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  So I go downstairs and Marie says, look, let's let her stay.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  She doesn't want to go home.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  So we'll put her up in the, we have in the little room at the top of the, if you see the layout,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  come over.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  You guys will see the layout for yourselves.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  So she stays in the little room upstairs.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  I don't think much too much about it.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  It's not a big deal.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  She wakes up, she takes a bath, which is odd.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  You know, you don't do that.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  It's a weird behavior.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  She takes a bath and she starts cleaning again.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  And we're like, okay, fine.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Clean again.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Sunday was the last, a third day anyway.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  We did a three day trial and it was the final day.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  So we knew she was gone for good no matter what on Sunday.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  She's always going out to her car.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  Okay.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Which I did not think was too suspicious.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  I just thought she was going to join or something because she came back a little, you know,
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  different, but happy, always happy, not miserable.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And she would talk about her life a little bit.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  She told us about her daughter in Italy and she married a very wealthy Italian guy.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  And then it gets to be around 9.30, 10.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  And I'm like, Marie, you handled the hours.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  I don't, we're not going to pay her for the time she slept.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Right.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  We're not paying her.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  So you take care of this.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  I don't want to deal with it.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  I'm going to the number and I'll send her the money.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Marie goes, says, okay.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Next thing I'm in my office area.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Marie is not hit with her.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  She comes in and says, I'm really tired.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Do you mind if I lay down for a few minutes before I drive home?
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  And I say, sure, fine, no problem.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  So she's wearing like a jacket getting ready to, she's ready to leave.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And then I look at her and like, she's actually ready to leave.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  It's good.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  Take a nap.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  Go for it.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  She lies down.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  She doesn't wake up.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  She dies.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  She fucking died on her bed.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  She's fucking dead.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  Like fucking dead.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Right.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  And the only reason I knew she was dead was later because I mean, I thought she was alive
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  because at any moment I thought she was going to pop up and we're pushing her and stuff like that.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  And I tried to feel for a pulse and I sort of remember what to do.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And I swear to God, I felt the pulse and there was warmth in her wrist.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  And it was, unless I was feeling my own pulse in my fingers, which people do that too.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  I don't know.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  But it wasn't until she, like, I don't know anything about it.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  I mean, I saw my father dead, but I never saw that this happened.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  Like her face turned, it was like a bruise color.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  It was a purplish.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  It was not natural.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And that's when we knew, like, holy shit, this woman is dead.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  And now it's fucking scary.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  So we were freaked out.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  Marla did not see anything.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  He was asleep.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  He was asleep.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  He's got his little treehouse room on the other side of the wall.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  Oh, thank you.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  Of course.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Jesus.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  I mean, we didn't want him walking in either.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  So at all times, I had someone had to be in front of that door just in case he came down.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  Like, yeah, he doesn't want some more Cheerios, you know, kind of like TV.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  But of course, this morning, Marla, you can watch all the TV you want.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  You go upstairs and you watch TV.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  This is TV morning, right?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  You watch as much as you want.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  And Marie called the ambulance.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And then all hell broke loose, man.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Is it?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  The ambulance came.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  And what we learned later from the report, because it's in the report,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  was that, supposedly, Sabah, Sabah, hate with a B, having to,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  was talking to Patel at 9.30 a.m. in the morning on a Monday, which is weird.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Because Patel did not, she either did not sleep in that before or this is all a lie.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  Okay.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And calls and says, holy shit, there's an ambulance going to Val's and Marie's.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Come over now.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  And then she calls Steve.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  And Steve comes over.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  So LAPD is there.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  The ambulance people are there.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Steve is there.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Patel is there.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  And not only is she there, but she is screaming at him.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  He's calling us murderers, saying profanities.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  Throwing fucking rocks.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Throwing fucking rocks.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  All right.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  That's how fucking crazy she is.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Not only did she show up, but all the people that hate us in the building are there.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  Just like really enjoying this.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Not in the building, but the campus.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  And there's a, there's three or four of them.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  You know, and one of them is the management.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  We're in a huge fight with the management.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  A woman named Ashley Madison.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Ashley Madison.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  Ashley Madison.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  Ashley Madison.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  Ashley Madison.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  I didn't hack that.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Actually, something, she's just a pain in the ass.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  And she decided, oh, can I just tell you, police officers that Val, we always thought Val was on drugs.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  We always thought Marie was on drugs.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  And Bob, Bob, Bob.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Okay.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  And she, and then this guy named Stosh.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  And I'll tell you, he's like one of these people that always wished he was a Marine, you know, the types.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  They're like, they wear like the clothes, like they pretend that they were served in Vietnam.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  And they pretend they served in Afghanistan, but they never did anything.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  And they never even left their town.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  And he works at the building too.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  He opens the door for the cars, basically.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  He's like a dormant for cars.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  But the attitude, and he's very, he's got this racist fucking thing too.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  And he was there too.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  And he said, excuse me, officer, I would like to talk to you in person a little longer afterwards.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Yeah, I know exactly.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  He's just going to talk shit about me.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  And I just was like, what the fuck is happening?
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  The film crew that's following me around, they came.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  And they said, there was so much animosity in the air.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  They said, we knew, and we don't want to tell you this, but we feel like this was the whole setup.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  This was planned.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  Like there was people, there was evil there.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  There was something hatred there for you.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  My name's Rocco.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  It wasn't obviously not now.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  And I've been told about this, Adore.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  But Rocco Castoro, he was the former editor-in-chief of Vice.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  And he's doing a documentary.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  No.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Sorry?
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  Yeah, I think I saw it on YouTube.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  Oh, you didn't?
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  It's on?
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  Formerly.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  Yeah.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  Sorry, you have a new channel.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  Yeah, anything with some other, some dude named Tim Pool, which I don't know him,
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  but I heard bad things.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  So I'm trying to distance myself from that name, is what I've been told.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  It's like, well, whatever you do, don't associate yourself with that name.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  But he's financing this project for some reason.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  Yeah, trying to recreate Vice magic.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  Exactly.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  He was fired, actually.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  Yeah.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  It was the way he tells the sexual harassment thing that they were covering up in HR.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  And it was a whole mess, because the sexual harassment was from wines,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  the head of HR worked for Harvey Weinstein as well.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  This is a whole fucking mess.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  It's like a real fucking crazy shit.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  Anyway, don't believe everything Rocco says, because he exaggerates and bellishes a lot.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  But he did say, like, we were not welcome.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  They told us to leave right away.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  And not dating the police, the building.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  So they had to take all this stuff and go.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  And then Marie also said, I felt like we were set up.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  I felt like, how did the fuck did Sabah already have a court date ready on the back of her car when she came?
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  How is that possible?
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  How did she have that court date for Monday?
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  And I was like, I don't know.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  I don't know how DCFS works.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Apparently, the due process is not a thing there.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  There's no such thing as due process.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  They can do whatever the fuck they want.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  And that is fucking terrifying.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  And if you read that report and you were me, you would see.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  If you could see from my point of view, which I don't know if you'll be able to because you're not me.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  You don't know what I'm like and what Marie's like and Marla's like and Patel and Steve.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  It's fucking terrifying that this is in the public record.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  And there's a judge that yesterday, the judge heard this.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  And I'm sorry.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  I'm scared to have Hava, the social worker.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  She comes.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  Marie is fucking in tears.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  She is crying.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  She's inconsolable.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  She is barely in our reality at this point.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  And this woman comes up to her and says,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  so did you kill her?
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  So was it an overdose?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  Are you drugs?
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  Yeah?
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Tell me how many drugs did you do today?
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  And she's like this.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  Right there.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  And Marie is just uncontrollably sobbing, telling her to fuck off as nice as she possibly can.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  But she's answering the question.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  She's like, no, of course not.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  Where's the cleaning supply?
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  Show me the cleaning.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  And the LAPD would not let her in the house.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  So that was good.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  They wanted this woman out there.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  Now, I have some footage of her screaming at Marie because the security camera did get a pretty good view of it.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  I have not gone through any yet because I've been going through all this other shit.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  I will do that later today.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  And I'll find out exactly what the fuck happened.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000]  Now, everything was fine.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  And the coroner, we had to wait for the coroner.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  And the coroner comes in and he's like, he comes in like a superstar.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  He's like, everyone's waiting for the coroner.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  He shows up.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  He's like, well dressed, well groomed.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  He's like, hey guys, I'm here.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  And I was like, OK, good.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  Interesting.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  He was like a personality, which was strange and interesting.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]  And then the whole mood changed.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  And all suspicions toward me just sort of dissipated.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  And the guy did his job and he was very thorough.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  And he said, Val, here's the case number.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  Any questions you call me?
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  I'm sorry to tell you, but when people die, there's a blood barrier thing in your nose.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  And the blood drips out the nose.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  So there's blood on the bed.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  I was like, no, OK, it's disgusting.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  He said, you're probably going to want to get rid of the sheets.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  I was like, yes.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  They will take them for us.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  They can take the fucking sheets, man.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  But Saba, during this time, takes Marlowe and gives him the Steve
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  and decides that Marlowe cannot be with us.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  She makes this decision.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  She's screaming at Marie.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  Marie is inconsolable and she takes Marlowe.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  She does not tell Marie, OK, until later.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  And then Marlowe, and if Marie comes to me, I'm inside talking to police officers.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  She took them.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  They took Marlowe.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  They took Marlowe.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  So I start running out there.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  I get to the fucking park and I see Marlowe and he's sitting down.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  I see Saba and they're going about to approach Marlowe.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  I see Steve behind her.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Just fucking.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  Steve's so sick, he's smiling.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  He's fucking grinning.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  He's fucking smiling.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  He's so happy about this shit.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  And I go there.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  I say, you're not taking Marlowe.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  No.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  You're not taking Marlowe.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  I get between her and Marlowe and I say, no.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Marlowe just comes with me.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  He grabs my hand.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  OK.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  And Steve is not like this.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Saba is fucking upset.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  And she goes, it's like this.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  It makes me work hard.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  It's sort of the sigh.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  And then she walks over to the police officer and tells him something.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  He comes over.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  It's like, you have to release the child now.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  You have to let him go now.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  I don't even know who this woman is.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  She comes here.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  I don't even see a badge.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  I have no paperwork.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  I have his card with court date on it.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  OK.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  Nothing.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  Do you see a badge around her?
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  She's just a social worker.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  She's not a fucking officer.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  And the guy says, listen, you have to let go of the child now.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  So I'm like, OK.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  So Marlowe is going to be fine.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  We'll figure it out.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  Don't worry.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  Et cetera.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  Steve takes him off.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  Takes him away.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  And we haven't seen him since.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  Now, we get this fucking shitty lawyer.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  Here's a problem.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  Sorry.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  It's so convoluted.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  But I just want to make sure you got it.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  I want to be thorough.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Right?
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  I don't want to miss any details.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  This is important.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  Marie is so upset that she doesn't care a woman just died on the bed.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  She gets a blanket and just goes on the bed and sleeps.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  And I'm like, wow.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  I didn't think she had that in her.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  I was like, there's some coldness in her.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  I'm like, Marie, use that coldness.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Later I am.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  You've got to use that now.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  You cannot lose your shit like you did today with Salva.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  Because she was screaming and crying.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  And Marie's not a weak woman.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  But something happened at that moment.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  The woman really worked her.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  And then we immediately called this woman named Dorothy Gibbons White.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  And she is a lawyer that represented a famous friend of Marie's that was an NCIS actress named Zoe.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  And she did the most horrendous thing that he could do.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  But you know what?
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  She fucking fights dirty.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  She accused the husband of Zoe of being a child rapist.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  Like raping the son, Sebastian, every day for like a year or something.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  And I'm like, wow.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  Let's fuck that.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  And Marie's like, fuck that.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  I don't think it's true.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  I'm like, what?
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  And I'm like, I don't think it's true.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  Like really?
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  It's like, we've got to get this woman.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  You need to fucking hire her.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Because now we're so pissed off.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  We need someone to fight dirty.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  So we call her.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  And she says, you know, Sebastian got off.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  But he was held for four months in Kentucky.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  The police caught him trying to go across state lines.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  The FBI was involved.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  It's a thing.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  He really is this dirty.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  And we start to believe her more.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  And we want to believe her.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  Right?
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  Because we want her help.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  Because we know that she fights dirty.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  We want some of the fucking women.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  And I'm here at any cost.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Whatever the fucking cost is.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  We want Marlo.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  You know?
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  And she starts saying, does Steve ever hang out with JP?
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  JP is the name of the guy that's this child rapist.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  And so he was the wife.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  So if you look at the internet, if you Google those two names,
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  you'll see the story.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  And as a matter of fact, Steve is friends with this guy, JP.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  And all gravitates around this fucking school called Lila.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  And the guy that's the head of that school is named Nordeem.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  I filed a police report on him in May for being way too handsy
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  with Marie and all the women at that fucking school
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  and the children.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Because he is grabbing them, hugging them, everybody.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  He's very handsy.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  And it's a French thing to do.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  I get it.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  But we're not fucking friends.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  All right?
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  And Marlo doesn't like it.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  He does not like it when the guy grabs his fucking shoulder
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  all the time and rubs his back.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  He doesn't like it.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  And I tell Marlo, well, tell him not to do it.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  You know?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  If I'd see him, I'll fucking tell him.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  But I've never seen him do it.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  Marlo tells us.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  So I was pissed off.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  And on top of that, this guy says to Marie right to email,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  Marie wants to have a meeting with the teacher
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  because we're worried about Marlo's work
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  because he wasn't doing his math and work.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  He's lying to us about it.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  And she wanted to set up a meeting.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  And Nordeem said, he's the head guy.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  The guy that's too handsy says, Marie.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  He's the principal.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  He's the principal.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  Yeah.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  He says, Marie, I would go, but you have to go.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  I'll tell you when the meeting will be.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  And Steve is going to be there.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  And Marie says, I'm not.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  I can't be in a room with Steve.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  I do not want to be meeting with Steve.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  I'll do my own meeting.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  Steve can do it.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  I have his own meeting.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  And then he says, and I shit you not, Marie,
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  if you don't go to the meeting with your husband,
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  I will call Child Services on you.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  In an email.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  And we have that email.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  OK.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  And then that's when I lose my shit.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  And I fucking call the police.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  I said, this guy's harassing us.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]  He's being fucking handsy.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  He just threatened my girlfriend.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  And what he does with the kids is fucking strange.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  Now, take that completely unrelated.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  I had no idea that Dorothy Gibbons White, the prosecutor,
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  also had a file on this guy.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  Apparently, there is something fucking weird shit going on down there.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  How much of it is real?
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  I don't know.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  How much of it is fake?
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  I don't know.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  Because she is, again, fights dirty.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  But she blends fiction with fact, but she does it well.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  And I can't even fucking tell the truth anymore.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  So I don't care at this point.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Maria doesn't care.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  We're going to have to go to that level and accuse Steve
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  of hanging out with a known fucking kiddie fiddler.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  How to file.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  If that's what's going to win, then let's just fucking do it.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  So she says, all right.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  But here she says, and I have, and I'm
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  happy if you guys want to take this further and go for it.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  Because I have, I recorded all of it.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  So you have her on tape saying to Marie,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  do you think Marlo, could you get Marlo to say this?
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  Could you get him to say this?
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  She's like, probably.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  This is what we need Marlo to say.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  And Marlo's eight.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  She's fucking saying that on the phone.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  She says, if I were you, it was my family,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  I would want Mike Kratzmer to represent me.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  It's like a mafia down there.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  But he's in the mafia, but he's like a spy.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  He's a good guy.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  I'm like, OK.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  So that's the guy we call.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  He immediately wants $15,000.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  And he is a fucking piece of work.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  And he's the worst lawyer I've ever fucking seen.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  He's the one that reached out to jamming
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  and said he was representing me.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  All right.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  No, there's one thing I missed.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  I thought it was $15,000.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  No, we did not.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  No, not at all.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Fuck yeah.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  That's $700 an hour for three days of work.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  And what he did on Monday was nothing.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  He did not say a fucking, he did not defend us.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  He said, I don't even have to show up on the camera.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  OK.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Just Marie's going to sit there.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  So I set up this whole thing with lights,
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  beautiful.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  And you have to call him.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  Yeah, you have to call him.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  And a proper camera with a proper lens.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  So she looked good.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  Like everyone else was looking good, right?
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  But the lawyer, no, he fucked up.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Sent us a link at the last second.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  And she had to do it from her phone.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  It looked terrible.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  And we were the only ones, or she was the only one
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  holding the phone.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Everyone else was at their computers.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  Well-dressed.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  Everything looked good.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  And Marie's, we just looked unprepared.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  And Clumsy Inn just, it was terrible.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  And the lawyer did not defend us.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  He did not say that none of this is true.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  He didn't say that the teal was crazy.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  He didn't say that Steve was using this as a tool for anything.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  He just said one thing.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  He said, all I ask is that the child is not sleeping
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  in the same bed as the father.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  And I say, oh shit, I know who he's going for.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  I know who he's building up, what he's going to build up to.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  But he doesn't defend us.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  And that's when I start losing, then I start texting him
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  and say, what are you doing?
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  You didn't put anything into evidence.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  You didn't mention anything about all these disdainless litany
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  things I've sent him.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  And he just screams at me and tells me,
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  I'm not listening to him.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  If I was a brain surgeon, would you tell a brain surgeon
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  what to do?
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  You know, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  And then it was just-
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Did you submit a brief to the court?
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  I don't know.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  We don't even have it.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  As far as I know, he submitted nothing.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  He said he didn't give the court anything.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  He just asked the late, did you read the documents?
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  And she says, not yet, give me a few minutes.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  That's all I remember.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  And then she read the documents.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  And then she said, I want to see this guy dial.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  Because I'm painting out to be this controlling, fucking asshole
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  that is like, you know, Marie is too weak to speak for herself.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  And Marie is so fucking sick of hearing from men telling her
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  how weak she is that she needs another man to speak for her.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  Like, if you guys don't ever tell that to her,
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  because she's slacking.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  All right.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  But that's how she's painted out, not only by Steve,
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  but by everybody.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  All right.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  And now I am the controlling Spangali that is controlling her.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  For what purpose?
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  I don't know.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  You know, it's not like she has money.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  There's nothing I want.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  I'm trying to get for her.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  But apparently this is what I'm painting out.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  There's one more important thing after that.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  It's where I forget.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  It's really important.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  Lori, the woman, she took out the garbage once.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  I wish there was one more than one.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  But there was this one time, I think it was Saturday.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  There were three of that.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  Lori's the one who passed the law.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  Yes.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  Yes.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  But three different bags of black garbage.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000]  And I wasn't, this is told to me by Marie.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  It's the second hand.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  Marie will tell you the full story, much better than me.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  And Marie felt something was wrong.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]  Something suspicious, because she was watching the bags
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  from upstairs, which she thought was great.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  So Marie said, I'll just take these bags out.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  And Marie and Lori was trying to tell her,
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  no, don't do what I'll do.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  And she's like, no, that's okay.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  I'll take them out.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  And I think Marlowe goes with her.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  I don't remember.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  She goes outside.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  She opens the garbage.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  And in Garbage Bag A are my files from when
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  I was in Cook County, foster care.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  It's a stack of this big that I got when David was
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  doing my background.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  And so we got all this stuff from Cook County in Chicago.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  And it's a huge stack of papers of my own,
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  tired childhood, in the misery of it all.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  Included in that is a notebook that I wrote in,
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  like poems and songs from when I was like 16 or 17.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  And there was another screenplay that was really
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  terrible, shitty screenplay, but I don't know
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  why she chose that.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  But you had to go to get this file.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  You had to know where they were.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  They were in my library.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  And you have to go and scrap them.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  It was not something that was accessible.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  Now bag number two was the same thing,
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  but for Marlowe.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  It was Marlowe's school assessments,
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  all the teacher assessments, all his grades,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  everything he's ever gotten from school.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  It's all in this one dossier sort of thing.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  In the third bag, there wasn't anything interesting.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  She said there was, there might have been something,
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  but not like this, something else.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  And so Marie flipped out, you know,
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  what this means.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  I still don't know what this means.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  It's very strange.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000]  So she was taking out the trash,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  but it hadn't gone all the way yet?
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  No.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  Well, she was going to steal it.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  So she was pretending, this is how she was going
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  to get the papers out in the garbage cans,
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  in the garbage bags, and then pretend that she was...
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  Yes, yes, this stage.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000]  And that's why maybe she was going to her car all the time.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  And we found out that she did steal some shit from us,
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  which is funny enough, the Crystal Jewelry.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  I shit she not, I shit she not.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  She stole the fucking Crystal Jewelry that Marlowe made.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  Yes.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  Okay.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000]  So that's the short version.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  Yeah?
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  Cleaning up.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  Cleaning up.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  Yeah, and then I got...
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000]  Actually, yesterday, I got a text from Rocco,
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  who's the guy...
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000]  The film...
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  The film...
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  Yeah, the ex-Vice News guy.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  He said...
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  He did some background on Lori,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  and he said that she was...
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Rocco.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  Okay.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  It's Lori Roth, date of birth, 117, 1960.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  She has an extensive criminal history,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  breaking and entering, distribution and trespassing.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  If your neighbor was watching Marlowe
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  and claiming he had bruises around the times,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  we were shooting, I can refute that with footage.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  Okay, let's...
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  Yeah, she claimed that he had bruises and a black eye.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  That Marlowe had a fucking black eye.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  Never.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  Never.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  Never.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  Never.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  He never had bruises other than falling off his bicycle.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  You know, his scraped knee.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  What did the judge finally decide on Monday?
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  The judge said...
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  The judge said, okay, great.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  So, I want to see this Val person.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Can we please see Val?
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  And so, he recalls me and I sit down.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  I don't say a word,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  because our lawyer says, don't talk.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  So, I listen to the lawyer.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  And she looks at me.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  There's a pause for like three or four seconds,
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  and she says, I'm going to recommend
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  that the child does not see Val Brooksman at all
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  and has minimum visits with the mother.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  Minimum visits.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  Minimum.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  Like, the bare minimum that they have to...
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  The minimum.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  They could give away a few hours, three days a week.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  You know?
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  Is there a deadline that someone not acquires
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  or wouldn't go back to court?
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  Nope.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  We had no paperwork.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  We did nothing.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  I had no paperwork from anyone.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  No one from fucking DCF asked.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  From the courts.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  Nothing.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Can you tell me on September 29th,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  you guys have the follow-up hearing
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  where they'll make a more firm decision?
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Or is that...
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  Yeah.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  So, on September 15th,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  I thought that was the court,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  that if it's not,
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  it's when the investigator has to hand in his paperwork.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  And then the next trial date is the 29th.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  And if there's no amicable decision made,
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  October 1st is the real trial,
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  like a trial trial,
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  where people will get witnesses,
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  like the television or something.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  Okay.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  So, yeah.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  So that's...
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  All right.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  The short version.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  It's pretty crazy.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  It's like the cop said,
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  he's like,
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  you got hit with a double wham.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  A double wham.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  And that's been stuck in my head ever since.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  He was very right.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  He was a double fucking triple wham.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  Sorry.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  Speak my language.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  How often does that film feature,
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  you know, sector guys?
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  Not often.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  Not anymore.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  So they've filmed...
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  So David Enrich,
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  you know,
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  he tried to get a film deal
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  during this whole thing,
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  very unethical,
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  and he held on to...
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  You probably don't want to hear any of this shit,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  but I'll tell you anyway,
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  because it's so fucking political.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  If you're like Tim and Jim,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  you don't want to hear it.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  But Trump has these loans
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  with Deutsche Bank, right?
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  And David sat on them
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  for a very long time.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  And I'm like,
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  why did you sit on them?
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  He said,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  well, Deutsche Bank told me they were fake.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  I'm like, no.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  You listen to Deutsche Bank told me.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  He has a deal set up with Deutsche Bank.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  It's kind of Eurgen.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  I forgot his last name,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  but he's the head of the PR.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  It's a, you know,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  scratch on my back,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  I'll scratch yours.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  And for example,
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  with Tom Bowers,
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  remember Tom Bowers?
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Tom Bowers was
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Rosemary Vibraleck's boss
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  at DBTCA.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  Rosemary Vibraleck
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  was Trump's private banker
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  at Deutsche Bank.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  So he died.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  His death was very suspicious.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  It was suicide.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  He hung himself in Malibu.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  It was similar to my father.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  Very similar.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  And then the coroner,
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  there was a huge problem with the body.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  We couldn't get the police report
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  because the body had melted
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  mysteriously on Christmas Day
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  and they shipped it to Virginia
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  for some reason.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  And that's, so we can't,
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  it's cause of death,
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  no one can tell anyone.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  Very fucking weird, right?
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Of all the bodies in the world,
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  of all the deaths in the world,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  this is death.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  That is, no evidence.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  It's just fucking strange.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  And that was the last time
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  I spoke to Jim and Tammy as well.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  I bring up Tom Bowers
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  because, why do I bring up Tom Bowers?
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Oh, because he knows about the lungs, right?
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  That was David's source.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  And I know that can be a whole mean source.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  And then when he died,
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  David tweeted out,
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  it was a sad day,
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Tom Bowers died today.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  He said, he's a good man.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  He's got a family, sir.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  He left out the most important bit,
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  suicide, right?
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Because he has to deal with
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  Deutsche Grange.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  They said, do not imagine the suicide.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  So it was myself and Scott Steadman.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  I told Scott about it.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  And Scott is a,
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  he's like a Twitter,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  forensic music,
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  he runs this thing called forensic music.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  It's like a Twitter phenomenon.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  It's like 20 years old,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  he's got a million followers.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Because he handles
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  the Trump-Russia thing really well.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  So I tell him this story
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  and he gets on.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  He's a genius with public information.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  He finds anything in the public domain
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  and he gets the cause of death.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And then we do a story about the cause of death.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  And now we're in a battle against David.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  As I've always,
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  as I've been since that fucking article came up.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Sorry, that's,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  I don't know why
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  it felt that was important
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  for you guys to know.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  So you said David was,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  you began by saying David was sitting on the,
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  sitting on the wall.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  Yeah.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  The Trump bill, you know.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  But then,
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  forensic news,
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  did they have their own?
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  I mean, I guess the,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  the George Bank of data,
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  seems like you shared it with Tim,
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  with Tim and more?
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  I did.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  I gave it to Tim and Jeremy.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  And then,
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  David also had a copy of it.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  No, I never,
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  I never gave David a full,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  I would never,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  I do not,
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  you know,
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  I gave him a doc,
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  a selective amount of documents.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  But then,
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  he's had the Trump data.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  No.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  No, no, no.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  So how did,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  how did David know about it?
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Tell him about it.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Okay.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  Now, if you remember,
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  there was a guy,
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  he's a pundit,
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  he's like a liberal-ish,
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  not Chris Matthews,
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  but,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  I can't remember his name.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  But he went on the air one,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  one night and said,
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  ladies and gentlemen breaking news,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  I have the Trump loan documents,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  from the Russian banks.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  And they are very well,
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  very much exactly what you thought,
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  you guys all thought.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  Stay tuned,
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  et cetera, et cetera.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Next day,
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  he says,
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  ladies and gentlemen,
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  I have to retract my statement,
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  from the other night.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  I don't have them.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  Turns out they were fraudulent.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And so,
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  what the fuck.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  And Deutsche Bank's lawyer
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  has got ahold of this guy.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  He's a famous name,
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  I just can't,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  it's not coming to my mind.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  And told him that
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  these are fraudulent documents
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  and if you go,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  you're gonna fucking see the shit out of you,
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  you're never gonna work again.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  And that's what you got scared
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  and backed out.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  Now there are some fraudulent documents
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  out there,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  I've seen them on Scribd.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  They're terrible,
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  frauds,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  but these aren't the ones.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  These are different documents.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Fraudulent documents are more...
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  Not in my data set.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Not just Deutsche Bank.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Well,
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  my data set's grown substantially
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  since 2014,
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  but it's not from my data set.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  Please.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  It's like no one's talking about
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  the best way that we can help people.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  There's a couple options right now
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  that we already have to talk about a little bit
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  as far as the investigator goes, right?
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  What are the allegations against you?
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  I mean, I know we've talked about all of them,
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  but you have like some where you've,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  like if you see the lack of food
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  and you have cell phones everywhere.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  Yeah, I don't really know what the allegations are,
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  other than drug addicts.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  You know, but it's easy to call them drug addicts.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  I am very open about my past.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Right.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  You know, I've taken drugs.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  It's a big deal.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  You're not undergoing now,
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  because you said you know a drug test.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Yes.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  So that should be,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  that should probably solve itself, right?
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  It should, but it doesn't.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  It didn't,
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  because then the,
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  our lawyers just don't take any drug tests,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  don't talk to them if they call,
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  you hang up.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  If they're at the door,
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  you don't open it.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  They're like, okay, fine.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  Do you recommend that safe thing?
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  I don't know.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  Well,
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  he's the lawyer.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  I just decided,
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  he knows more than me.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  So I trust him,
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  blindly,
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  until yesterday.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  My,
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  my,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  so that's what I did.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  And that was stupid of me.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  Very fucking stupid of me.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And Marie did the same thing.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  And if I had not trusted him,
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  Marie would not have trusted him.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  Does Marie also get a drug test
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  after her work you said?
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  Yes,
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  randomly.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  Yes.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  I would imagine that.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  It wouldn't be a huge issue,
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  because if Marie already got a drug test,
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  there would be one after the last.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Right.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  And it's perfectly okay to go with your own doctor,
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  because you don't trust these DCF people
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  and give your own fucking drug test.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  You're overseen by doctor,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  and your doctor will hand it to you.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  That's fine too.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  I read it online.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  But the Saba woman would not allow that.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  She didn't want that.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  And I also said,
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  no,
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  Saba,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  and I have it on the table.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Saba,
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  I said I was willing to take a drug test.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  I didn't say I was going to be there
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  at 3.30
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  and Beverly Hills
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  on fucking Friday.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  That I did not say.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  It was,
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  well,
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  you know that if you don't take a test,
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  it's going to,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  that means that you are called,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  quote, dirty,
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  they call it.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  Well,
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  that's a,
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  well,
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  you know that's a bunch of bullshit.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  It's a lie.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Why would you do that?
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  That's just the way it is.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Can she get what you want
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  in Beverly Hills?
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  She said anytime between nine
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  and five
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  on a Friday,
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  on Friday,
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  yes,
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  in Beverly Hills.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  Okay.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  And then I was,
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  we're both ready to go
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  until Thursday night
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  before police come.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  Okay.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  And then we're pissed off.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  And we're like,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  you know what?
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  I'd help that Mike
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  recommend not.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  Yes.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  Yes.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  So it's like,
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  you know,
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  we weren't even supposed to call her
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  and say no,
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  we're just,
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  but we picked up the phone
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  or stupidly even talked to her.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  But this woman is,
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  it's like,
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  something's wrong.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  Something's really wrong.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  We don't know what it is.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  I know what I don't know,
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  which is a substantial.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  Are you guys,
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  do you guys know anything even,
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  that I don't know?
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  What can you help me with this?
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  What is happening?
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  I have no idea.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  No one's told me anything.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  Even Mike,
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  the lawyer is supposed to be
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  the greatest ever.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  He doesn't,
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  he told me shit.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  He fired him.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  That's right.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  Interesting.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Do you guys have things
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  for another lawyer?
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  Well,
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  that's what I was going to find
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  out today.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  See what you guys can do.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  And if you could save us,
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  you know,
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  you know,
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  I don't know.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  If you could save us,
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  you know,
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  $15,000,
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  it would be great.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  But I'm trying,
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  I have to gauge what you can do
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  to see if I need a lawyer.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  That's why I'm
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  making this right now.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  So not only you're gauging me,
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  but I'm gauging this.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  It's a tough call.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  Like,
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  we're not going to send
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  an FBI lawyer to represent me.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  Right.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  The things we can do,
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  I mean,
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  if there's a question of money,
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  sometimes we can
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  get you some money.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  But obviously I can't.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  We have,
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.040]  You know, obviously, we're not wealthy, but we can do this.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.440]  Yeah, remember what you were saying,
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.160]  and I mean, you've missed your wealth yourself.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.560]  You said trade didn't end one time.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.960]  Yeah, I mean, I've lost more than you made, but yeah, I got it.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:16.160]  You know, don't tell, don't tell Mary.
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.160]  You're doing the last few more.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:24.000]  Actually, that's probably my best, when crisis, time, and crisis.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.920]  So there's that type of stuff.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.360]  The other thing that we talked about, too, is we have to keep
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.600]  our relationship secret.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.680]  Yeah, that's the only way that we can do it.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.320]  So if, you know, I call a shop, stop, or something like that,
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:39.880]  and say, hey, we've got the deal, so we'll tell you why you want to know.
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:40.240]  Sure.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.320]  You have to stay small on it, right?
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.840]  So our relationship with you is going to be limited in scope, right?
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.560]  Like we talked about, it's likely going to be something where, you know,
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.320]  it's going to be something.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.840]  You know, I look at electronic cigarette thing, I just can't believe it.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.800]  Are you going to know all this smoke, electronic?
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.720]  Really? Inside?
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.520]  It's just, but it's not real.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.680]  I'm not aware of it.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:08.240]  So the main thing that we would call it, the main thing that we would be able to
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.040]  help with is, like, everything's going well, right?
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.120]  We can't change what's going on in the past, right?
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:17.440]  Because we can't change what, you know, Isala said, or what your neighbors have
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.240]  said, or anything.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.440]  Sure, right.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.040]  But going forward, we can help you with the investigator, right?
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.640]  Because the investigator is going to assess you and Marie to see if you
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.920]  get the two full parents.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.960]  So those are things that we can help with.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.800]  I'm trying to think there are other avenues that would like you.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.920]  I made a whole list of stuff.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.160]  I've been studying law for like a week, okay?
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.200]  I'm not a lawyer, but I figured there's some things that they've done very
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.720]  illegally, all right?
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.120]  Due process still exists, even in that court, all right?
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.920]  Even though some lawyers say no, some lawyers say yes, it does exist.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:53.080]  We read online on reputable law websites.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.200]  They're not supposed to invite themselves in and walk in.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.720]  They did.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:07.240]  This woman is clearly, the lies are so ridiculously, too many lies.
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:14.000]  And the only reason for that is to paint a picture because you have an agenda.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.800]  Why, why she has this agenda?
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.920]  Why she wants to destroy me or Marie?
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.840]  I don't know, I mean, I get it.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.240]  I've encountered people like this before.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.640]  I don't know why they do it, but they want to do it.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.640]  It's either, Marie always says I'm going to kill this, you know?
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.160]  I don't think it's jealousy.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.200]  I think it's something else.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.520]  I don't know what it is, but there's some reason that she wants us destroyed.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:41.920]  And she, and you have to, what I've learned is that this system,
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:45.520]  just the DCFS, is very corrupt.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.200]  There's some, they know each other.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.640]  It's ancestral, they all know each other.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:55.280]  This guy that worked there, our lawyer and customer, he was threatening Marie.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.000]  Okay, when we left, he fucking threatened her and said, you know what?
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.560]  If you don't get a vow, because I was calling him out, I said, why didn't you do this?
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.440]  If you don't get a vow to stop acting like a bully and know everything,
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.600]  you're going to have to make a choice between your son and Val.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.560]  We have that on tape, too.
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:14.560]  You got to hear this fucking, too.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.560]  It's crazy.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.320]  Okay.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:22.520]  Full soldier, too, I've dealt with this and other cases that are similar to yours.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.400]  With DCFI?
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.600]  With DCFI?
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600]  In Texas.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.600]  Oh, okay.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.600]  In some organizations.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.440]  But we don't, the thing is, I'm not an expert either, right?
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.200]  We've worked with some things in the past that have been successful stuff,
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.200]  and we actually got some good work out of it.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.560]  Everything turned out fine.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.960]  So that's my experience with it.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.080]  I'm not an expert in custody law and now across this work,
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.200]  I learn something new every day.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:53.320]  So the primary issue I see is this, like, if we're going to help, right,
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:58.120]  we're going to help and be effective in our job, but also be effective for you.
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:05.400]  So trying to uncover a conspiracy with Saba makes it, like, I mean,
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.120]  I don't think there's some weird stuff going on, but that's what I'm saying is that
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.080]  if the investigator does his job properly or her job properly,
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.600]  they should see that you guys are successful parents who can help raise Marlowe
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.000]  in a very productive way.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.280]  But here's the thing.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.560]  Any competent person, whether you're a DCFS or a police officer,
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.960]  anyone that is trained to deal with people,
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.200]  can delineate a same person from an insane person, right?
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.840]  You should be able to do that.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:41.400]  Now, when you meet Patel and you read her shit, she's obviously fucking nuts, right?
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:44.160]  Sorry for this, but clinical terms, she's fucking nuts.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.320]  She's out there.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:51.760]  And for Saba, I know is able to determine the difference between saying and not saying.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.440]  So she purposely, I suspect that she's a smart person,
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.960]  that she purposely included this woman's testimony for a reason.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.680]  She's against it, because she must know that she's fucking nuts.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:05.680]  They're using her.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:08.360]  It's sad for this woman.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.640]  I'm not that sympathetic for her anymore because she's did it, but it's, you know what I mean?
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.600]  I'm not saying it's very simple.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.920]  It's the first time I've heard it.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:19.680]  So you're saying that she's clinically insane, right?
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.600]  She's got a frontier bipolar.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.320]  Maybe not insane, but that's exaggeration.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.240]  Mentally unstable, for sure.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.120]  Classic bipolar.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.240]  I'm willing to bet you anything you'll find bipolar medication.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.840]  But just for reference, right?
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.560]  We probably wouldn't want to make that claim, right?
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.920]  You would, yes.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.360]  Or you would not.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:44.040]  Because if it's one, easy to tell that someone is clinically insane, and two,
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.280]  you know that she's insane, and three, why would you give custody to her
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.960]  for several hours a week?
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.000]  Because we didn't know it at the time.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.840]  He just hurt himself, right?
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.800]  So like, you know at the time, he's same argument to the lady with the investigation.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.880]  So that's an avenue I think would be dangerous for you than anything else, right?
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:04.560]  So we get her to retract her statement.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.240]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:10.120]  So again, are we going to go over there and break her off to retract the statement?
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.520]  Yeah, I'm ready to go to the Armenian.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.920]  I'm like, let's go find the Armenians.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.040]  They handle this shit, right?
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.560]  Luckily, we're lucky for you.
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.200]  The FBI doesn't do that, right?
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:25.520]  I mean, we are on the side of good because we're not going to influence people in that way.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.480]  It's just not how we work.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:29.080]  And like I told you on phone, I'll be honest with you.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.480]  What we can and what we can't do, I'm not going to make a story for you to say like,
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.640]  oh, we can turn the world around immediately for you right now.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.440]  No, I know.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:36.960]  I know.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.800]  I don't expect that.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.880]  But I'm trying to work with you to see what avenues we can best help with.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.720]  So like I said, the best thing I can think of right now is influencing how you're perceived.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.360]  And not in a negative way, not in a way that's illegal or anything, but just saying like,
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.760]  hey, if you have these issues, if you have, they say, oh, there's not enough food in the house.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:04.040]  And then we just show receipts, you get an Amazon delivery every week or something like that.
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.720]  Yeah, we have the receipts.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.920]  So all those things would be easily refuted by evidence that you can show.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.520]  And there's no evidence that the FBI is helping you or, you know, if we give you money to do that,
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.920]  that's just cash that you have, right?
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.920]  So all those things are ways that we can help your view in the court size.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:27.720]  Because what we talked about too and what we talked about on the phone is that it's very rare
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:30.680]  that they take custody completely away from the parent.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:35.080]  It can happen in very extreme cases, but at least the ones that I've been involved in,
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.960]  the judge almost always favors.
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.640]  And what we talked about, the mom almost wouldn't have a father or whatever.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.400]  I believe that you believe that.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.920]  But what I've read and studied in the last few days about this specific system in Los Angeles
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.640]  and these people, it's not that.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.560]  It's the opposite.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.920]  They give it to the perpetrator.
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:56.760]  They give it to the person that has the most money or the person that's been doing the illegal fake calls.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:02.560]  Because this is, obviously you can imagine, this is a tool used in many, many divorces.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.400]  That's the complicated part of it.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:10.000]  And I have not experienced in this, but just, you know, you've had an experience in the past
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.160]  and you've been like, this is complicated.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.320]  It's not just a child welfare situation, it's a divorce.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320]  It's weaponized.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.160]  They weaponized DCFS for divorce.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.960]  It's terrible, but that's what's happening.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:22.760]  And they know it.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.760]  And they're using it and making a lot of money.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:27.160]  They're fucking lawyers and judges.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:32.160]  Like, for example, Sabah makes $120,000 a year.
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.280]  Her supervisor makes 210 public records.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.480]  That's a lot of money for DCFS, right?
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.480]  And they have the other $80,000.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.520]  What's other?
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.760]  Where did that $80,000 come from?
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.920]  Over time.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920]  $60,000.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.040]  Over time.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.800]  And $25,000.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.960]  Other $90,000.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.360]  So what the fuck?
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.800]  Is that normal?
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.800]  I don't know, okay.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.240]  Anyway, I'm just saying it's suspicious to me.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.600]  But yeah, well, what can you do?
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.800]  What can you do?
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.000]  What is in your power and what's not?
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.880]  We have to do some more research, because the issue is what we can do would make it
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.440]  over it also, right?
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.920]  Also, you don't have a rebuttal either.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:21.320]  We wrote it on the piece of paper, the FPVF thing with like these, then we put sticky
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:24.840]  notes on the fake sticky notes on a digital thing.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.360]  Can't find it anywhere.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.200]  It only took two days to write it, and now we can't find the sticky notes.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:31.200]  We have to write it again.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.200]  So we will get you that.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.200]  We will get you that.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.800]  And I haven't uploaded all the evidence yet, like all the recordings that we have and
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:47.280]  all the video recordings, audio and video.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:54.040]  So, the last time I checked the email address, I didn't see anything, but that was before
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.040]  I left.
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.040]  You didn't see anything?
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.040]  No.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.040]  I sent it to you.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:02.400]  I sent it to that email address on Sunday night, and I checked on Monday to get anything
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.400]  yet.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.480]  But you don't, this should be, I sent you like a shitload of stuff last night, last night.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480]  Oh, last night?
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.480]  Okay.
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.480]  I haven't checked it.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.480]  Oh, okay.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480]  Because I haven't been flying in a year.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.480]  It's okay.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:16.480]  I sent you the text saying, I'm sorry, I just saw this now.
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:17.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.480]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:19.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.480]  I haven't checked whatever it is you sent.
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.480]  Okay, good.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.480]  Okay.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.480]  You've got a lot, there's a lot of reading in there.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480]  You'll see.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.480]  But you've read the report, though.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:30.480]  I don't have, if you sent the report in that group, I haven't read it yet.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:31.480]  The good report?
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.480]  No.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.480]  So, yeah, I just have a good report.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480]  Oh, good.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.480]  Okay.
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:36.480]  So, you sort of, oh, good.
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.480]  I got to you first.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.480]  That's good.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.480]  So, you get your first impression from me first.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.480]  Not that report.
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.480]  That's a good sign for me.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480]  Very happy to hear that.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.480]  That's good.
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:48.480]  So, we can do some more research on our insights, see what thing you have.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.480]  Good.
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.480]  I can't promise anything else, but I cannot promise my own right.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.480]  Like, I can't promise that I mean you don't need all of that help at all.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480]  That's good to me.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.480]  But I can't tell you I'll be honest, right?
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.480]  I'll be honest with you about what we can do and what we can't do.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:02.480]  And, I'll give you some options sometimes and say, well, we can try this and try that.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:05.480]  It may include to different ways.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.480]  But I can't promise what I promise what we can do.
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.480]  I got that.
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:12.480]  Um, Look, what do you want if you want it?
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:19.960]  What did you have on there that you wanted to show up?
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:22.080]  Seriously, it will be here all week.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.000]  OK, can you even find it in summary,
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.520]  like the overview of what you see?
