[03:36:54.460 --> 03:36:56.460]  Fed: Well, anything else
[03:36:56.460 --> 03:36:58.460]  Fed: that you think you might be able to help out with
[03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:00.460]  Fed: is what I'm going to do is I've written down
[03:37:00.460 --> 03:37:02.460]  Fed: a list of the stuff that
[03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:04.460]  Fed: we see you have Access To.
[03:37:04.460 --> 03:37:06.460]  Fed: And most look like
[03:37:06.460 --> 03:37:08.460]  Fed: financial project stuff
[03:37:08.460 --> 03:37:10.460]  Fed: which would be useful for someone.
[03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:12.460]  Fed: I don't know.
[03:37:12.460 --> 03:37:14.460]  Val: I can do
[03:37:14.460 --> 03:37:16.460]  Val: emails.
[03:37:16.460 --> 03:37:18.460]  Val: Those are pretty easy.
[03:37:18.460 --> 03:37:20.460]  Val: Again, social engineering
[03:37:20.460 --> 03:37:22.460]  Val: I'm pretty good at.
[03:37:22.460 --> 03:37:24.460]  Val: When I get in that zone
[03:37:24.460 --> 03:37:26.460]  Val: and turn on the charm,
[03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:28.460]  Val: I can do fun,
[03:37:28.460 --> 03:37:30.460]  Val: actually enjoy it sometimes.
[03:37:30.460 --> 03:37:32.460]  Val: Actually, that would be fun.
[03:37:32.460 --> 03:37:34.460]  Val: If you need...
[03:37:34.460 --> 03:37:36.460]  Val: I've been focusing
[03:37:36.460 --> 03:37:38.460]  Val: just as like any concerned citizen, I think
[03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:40.460]  Val: but you guys are FBI
[03:37:40.460 --> 03:37:42.460]  Val: so you don't have to answer the question.
[03:37:42.460 --> 03:37:44.460]  Val: I'm sort of Trump-based.
[03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:46.460]  Val: People come to me
[03:37:46.460 --> 03:37:48.460]  Val: with a lot of financial documents
[03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:50.460]  Val: from all over the world.
[03:37:50.460 --> 03:37:52.460]  Val: A lot of them are just...
[03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:54.460]  Val: There's a lot of hoops.
[03:37:54.460 --> 03:37:56.460]  Val: Some people like Ed from Ireland
[03:37:56.460 --> 03:37:58.460]  Val: is a legit guy.
[03:37:58.460 --> 03:38:00.460]  Val: The Catrice Jose guy
[03:38:00.460 --> 03:38:02.460]  Val: is some sort of state-run guy.
[03:38:02.460 --> 03:38:04.460]  Val: I don't know.
[03:38:04.460 --> 03:38:06.460]  Val: But I get a lot of that.
[03:38:06.460 --> 03:38:08.460]  Val: And then
[03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:10.460]  Val: there's
[03:38:10.460 --> 03:38:12.460]  Val: the Epstein thing with the sort of
[03:38:12.460 --> 03:38:14.460]  Val: a side gig for New York Times.
[03:38:14.460 --> 03:38:16.460]  Val: But I can
[03:38:16.460 --> 03:38:18.460]  Val: get that data,
[03:38:18.460 --> 03:38:20.460]  Val: but I did not want to take the step
[03:38:20.460 --> 03:38:22.460]  Val: to break in.
[03:38:22.460 --> 03:38:24.460]  Val: If you need me to do that, I'm happy to break in.
[03:38:24.460 --> 03:38:26.460]  Val: And if it's legal, and you guys are like
[03:38:26.460 --> 03:38:28.460]  Val: do legally, let's say
[03:38:28.460 --> 03:38:30.460]  Val: you can do this, I'm like OK
[03:38:30.460 --> 03:38:32.460]  Val: Good I'm happy to do that
[03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:34.460]  Fed: And it would definitely be something
[03:38:34.460 --> 03:38:36.460]  Fed: we would tell you to do with a bunch of other caveats
[03:38:36.460 --> 03:38:38.460]  Fed: and would not be allowed to do.
[03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:40.460]  Fed: But...
[03:38:40.460 --> 03:38:42.460]  Fed: Let's see.
[03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:44.460]  Fed: Let me know if I missed anything too,
[03:38:44.460 --> 03:38:46.460]  Fed: because I have
[03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:48.460]  Fed: Tyler Rossi about MPS.
[03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:50.460]  Fed: You did a man-in-the-middle for
[03:38:50.460 --> 03:38:52.460]  Fed: mom's computer.
[03:38:52.460 --> 03:38:54.460]  Fed: You hacked Deutche bank, but not really.
[03:38:54.460 --> 03:38:56.460]  Val: Right.
[03:38:56.460 --> 03:38:58.460]  Val: I still can, though.
[03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:00.460]  Val: I dony't know
[03:39:00.460 --> 03:39:02.460]  Val: should I or I don't know.
[03:39:02.460 --> 03:39:04.460]  Fed: If you ask me, you should not do any illegal activity.
[03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:06.460]  Fed: That's probably the best
[03:39:06.460 --> 03:39:08.460]  Fed: course of action.
[03:39:08.460 --> 03:39:10.460]  Val: No, I'm not going to know that for sure.
[03:39:10.460 --> 03:39:12.460]  Val: I'm not going to talk about that.
[03:39:12.460 --> 03:39:14.460]  Val: But hacking a bank
[03:39:14.460 --> 03:39:16.460]  Val: is just hacking the bankers.
[03:39:16.460 --> 03:39:18.460]  Fed: That's true. That's illegal.
[03:39:18.460 --> 03:39:20.460]  Fed: I wouldn't suggest it.
[03:39:20.460 --> 03:39:22.460]  Val: No, but I mean, in a case,
[03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:24.460]  Val: it would be something that you would want.
[03:39:24.460 --> 03:39:26.460]  Val: But can you really hack people like that?
[03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:28.460]  Fed: It's not something
[03:39:28.460 --> 03:39:30.460]  Fed: that we would normally do.
[03:39:30.460 --> 03:39:32.460]  Fed: So, like,
[03:39:32.460 --> 03:39:34.460]  Fed: it's good to know you have the skills, because we could
[03:39:34.460 --> 03:39:36.460]  Fed: put you in a situation where you can talk to other people,
[03:39:36.460 --> 03:39:38.460]  Fed: or we can introduce you to a group,
[03:39:38.460 --> 03:39:40.460]  Fed: or do something else, y'know, more complicated.
[03:39:40.460 --> 03:39:42.460]  Fed: But knowing your skills is a good thing to do.
[03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:44.460]  Fed: But it would be rare where I'd be like,
[03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:46.460]  Fed: hey, go hacking a Deutsche Bank,
[03:39:46.460 --> 03:39:48.460]  Fed: steal their stuff for me,
[03:39:48.460 --> 03:39:50.460]  Fed: because in court, that would be a hell of a thing
[03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:52.460]  Fed: to show that the
[03:39:52.460 --> 03:39:54.460]  Fed: government essentially hacked into a bank to deal with that.
[03:39:54.460 --> 03:39:56.460]  Val: Well, I know, but there's also
[03:39:56.460 --> 03:39:58.460]  Val: you guys, I'm sure you have people like this
[03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:00.460]  Val: in your agency, where other
[03:40:00.460 --> 03:40:02.460]  Val: agencies have the same types, where you find
[03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:04.460]  Val: an outside person like myself,
[03:40:04.460 --> 03:40:06.460]  Val: that you hire basically
[03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:08.460]  Val: to break the rules, but you don't say to break the rules.
[03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:10.460]  Val: You need someone that, you don't do that?
[03:40:10.460 --> 03:40:12.460]  Val: No? Okay.
[03:40:12.460 --> 03:40:14.460]  Fed: Definitely not.
[03:40:14.460 --> 03:40:16.460]  Fed: I would tell you this, the rule is
[03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:18.460]  Fed: if you were officially working with us,
[03:40:18.460 --> 03:40:20.460]  Fed: you are an extension of the government
[03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:22.460]  Fed: in the sense that if
[03:40:22.460 --> 03:40:24.460]  Fed: you can't do anything I can't do.
[03:40:24.460 --> 03:40:26.460]  Val: Like a self-contractor.
[03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:28.460]  Fed: Yeah, I guess you can kind of think about it like that.
[03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:30.460]  Fed: You're not employed by the government.
[03:40:30.460 --> 03:40:32.460]  Fed: But like, if I told you to
[03:40:32.460 --> 03:40:34.460]  Fed: hack into something, it'd be like me hacking into it.
[03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:36.460]  Fed: I can't do it, you can't do it.
[03:40:36.460 --> 03:40:38.460]  Val: Okay, so I'd represent,
[03:40:38.460 --> 03:40:40.460]  Val: who would you represent in the government?
[03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:41.460]  Val: Like, or...
[03:40:41.460 --> 03:40:42.460]  Fed: Indirectly, yeah.
[03:40:42.460 --> 03:40:44.460]  Fed: Like, you would give a...
[03:40:44.460 --> 03:40:46.460]  Fed: You would be getting the direction from the government, too, which I mean.
[03:40:46.460 --> 03:40:48.460]  Fed: It's like, there's an order
[03:40:48.460 --> 03:40:49.460]  Fed: or something.
[03:40:49.460 --> 03:40:51.460]  Fed: The action is from the government.
[03:40:51.460 --> 03:40:52.460]  Val: Right, right.
[03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:54.460]  Val: But technically, it's not, you're not,
[03:40:54.460 --> 03:40:55.460]  Val: it's not the government.
[03:40:55.460 --> 03:40:57.460]  Val: And who pays you is not the government either.
[03:40:57.460 --> 03:40:59.460]  Val: If you're an independent, who,
[03:40:59.460 --> 03:41:00.460]  Val: how do you pay it?
[03:41:00.460 --> 03:41:02.460]  Fed: You mean, if you were to
[03:41:02.460 --> 03:41:03.460]  Fed: be helping or something?
[03:41:03.460 --> 03:41:04.460]  Val: Sure.
[03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:06.460]  Fed: Yeah, that's the government.
[03:41:06.460 --> 03:41:08.460]  Val: Which actually comes from the government?
[03:41:08.460 --> 03:41:10.460]  Fed: No, [unintelligible]
[03:41:10.460 --> 03:41:11.460]  Val: Oh, okay.
[03:41:11.460 --> 03:41:12.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:41:12.460 --> 03:41:15.460]  Fed: But, we don't hire people to break the law.
[03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:17.460]  Fed: Like, to search [unintelligible]
[03:41:17.460 --> 03:41:18.460]  Val: Are there any...
[03:41:18.460 --> 03:41:19.460]  Fed: I'm sure they do.
[03:41:19.460 --> 03:41:21.460]  Fed: But that's Oklahoma's stuff.
[03:41:21.460 --> 03:41:23.460]  Fed: So, like, oversees the rules are different, right?
[03:41:23.460 --> 03:41:25.460]  Fed: Like, oversees your
[03:41:25.460 --> 03:41:27.460]  Fed: committing espionage, which is by the fact,
[03:41:27.460 --> 03:41:29.460]  Fed: you know, the fact that we're against the law, right?
[03:41:29.460 --> 03:41:30.460]  Val: Right.
[03:41:30.460 --> 03:41:31.460]  Fed: And the United States, you know,
[03:41:31.460 --> 03:41:33.460]  Fed: we're still bound by the Constitution.
[03:41:33.460 --> 03:41:35.460]  Fed: So, like, one distinction I want to make, too,
[03:41:35.460 --> 03:41:37.460]  Fed: is like, with the FBI, like,
[03:41:37.460 --> 03:41:39.460]  Fed: we will follow the rules every time.
[03:41:39.460 --> 03:41:41.460]  Fed: I'm never going to tell you to break the rule,
[03:41:41.460 --> 03:41:43.460]  Fed: and like, don't tell me about it or something.
[03:41:43.460 --> 03:41:44.460]  Val: We'll never deal with that situation.
[03:41:44.460 --> 03:41:45.460]  Val: Make a win-win.
[03:41:45.460 --> 03:41:46.460]  Fed: Never.
Val: That's good to know
[03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:48.460]  Fed: If I tell you something, like,
[03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:50.460]  Fed: even if I ask you to talk about something
[03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:52.460]  Fed: that could be construed as illegal,
[03:41:52.460 --> 03:41:54.460]  Fed: I'll have a whole document of, like,
[03:41:54.460 --> 03:41:56.460]  Fed: this is exactly what you're allowed to say,
[03:41:56.460 --> 03:41:57.460]  Fed: this is what you're not allowed to say,
[03:41:57.460 --> 03:41:59.460]  Fed: these are the communities[???],
[03:41:59.460 --> 03:42:01.460]  Fed: and you can't deviate from these four corners.
[03:42:01.460 --> 03:42:03.460]  Fed: Otherwise, we distance ourselves from you,
[03:42:03.460 --> 03:42:05.460]  Fed: because it's not what we ask.
[03:42:05.460 --> 03:42:06.460]  Val: Okay.
[03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:09.460]  Fed: So, because there's a lot of stuff about what the FBI is,
[03:42:09.460 --> 03:42:10.460]  Fed: or isn't
[03:42:10.460 --> 03:42:12.460]  Fed: Like, just from talking to you today, right?
[03:42:12.460 --> 03:42:14.460]  Fed: There's a lot of stuff that
[03:42:14.460 --> 03:42:15.460]  Fed: you've perceived to be as true
[03:42:15.460 --> 03:42:16.460]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:17.460]  Val: I totally learned a lot today.
[03:42:17.460 --> 03:42:18.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:42:18.460 --> 03:42:20.460]  Fed: So, that being said, it's like,
[03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:21.460]  Fed: if you work with us,
[03:42:21.460 --> 03:42:23.460]  Fed: it has to be very clear
[03:42:23.460 --> 03:42:25.460]  Fed: that you're not breaking any rules.
[03:42:25.460 --> 03:42:26.460]  Fed: Right?
[03:42:26.460 --> 03:42:28.460]  Fed: Because we also don't want to work with people
[03:42:28.460 --> 03:42:30.460]  Fed: who are not going to be able to follow directions.
[03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:32.460]  Fed: We talked about it, it makes sense to me,
[03:42:32.460 --> 03:42:34.460]  Fed: but, like, if you're going to give us information, too,
[03:42:34.460 --> 03:42:36.460]  Fed: we have to know that that is the whole fiction.
[03:42:36.460 --> 03:42:38.460]  Fed: You can't, like, take part of it.
[03:42:38.460 --> 03:42:40.460]  Fed: You can't omit the stuff
[03:42:40.460 --> 03:42:42.460]  Fed: that you don't want to tell us,
[03:42:42.460 --> 03:42:43.460]  Fed: what you tell us has to be everything.
[03:42:43.460 --> 03:42:45.460]  Fed: Because if we find out that it isn't everything,
[03:42:45.460 --> 03:42:46.460]  Fed: then we can't trust you, right?
[03:42:46.460 --> 03:42:47.460]  Val: Right, right.
[03:42:47.460 --> 03:42:48.460]  Val: So, you want me to hold back?
[03:42:48.460 --> 03:42:49.460]  Val: on like, Barrett.
[03:42:49.460 --> 03:42:52.460]  Val: If you ask me, tell me about Barrett.
[03:42:52.460 --> 03:42:53.460]  Val: So, that would be,
[03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:56.460]  Val: that would have to be what we have now.
[03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:58.460]  Val: So, we're not,
[03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:02.460]  Val: are we legally bound to tell you everything I know?
[03:43:02.460 --> 03:43:03.460]  Val: Not legally bound.
[03:43:03.460 --> 03:43:04.460]  Val: Here's the thing.
[03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:06.460]  Val: Can I make a mission based on what I think
[03:43:06.460 --> 03:43:08.460]  Val: is relevant and irrelevant?
[03:43:08.460 --> 03:43:09.460]  Val: Or no?
[03:43:09.460 --> 03:43:11.460]  Fed: It depends, right?
[03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:12.460]  Fed: I mean, like, here's the thing.
[03:43:12.460 --> 03:43:14.460]  Fed: You're not going to be your only source of information.
[03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:16.460]  Fed: That's not how to work either, right?
[03:43:16.460 --> 03:43:18.460]  Fed: I'm going to verify what you say.
[03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:19.460]  Fed: It's like I look at this stuff
[03:43:19.460 --> 03:43:20.460]  Fed: and I'll try to figure out it.
[03:43:20.460 --> 03:43:21.460]  Val: It's like a report.
[03:43:21.460 --> 03:43:22.460]  Val: Yeah, it's like a report, right?
[03:43:22.460 --> 03:43:24.460]  Fed: I mean, they're also investigators, so to speak.
[03:43:24.460 --> 03:43:26.460]  Fed: They publish their stuff.
[03:43:26.460 --> 03:43:29.460]  Fed: But, if you were to work with us, right?
[03:43:29.460 --> 03:43:32.460]  Fed: What I need from you most is trust.
[03:43:32.460 --> 03:43:34.460]  Fed: If I can't trust what you're saying,
[03:43:34.460 --> 03:43:36.460]  Fed: if I can't trust you with the information I give you,
[03:43:36.460 --> 03:43:38.460]  Fed: there's absolutely no reason we would work together.
[03:43:38.460 --> 03:43:39.460]  Fed: Right?
[03:43:39.460 --> 03:43:41.460]  Fed: Because if we were to involve you in something
[03:43:41.460 --> 03:43:43.460]  Fed: where you are involved with other criminals,
[03:43:43.460 --> 03:43:46.460]  Fed: you say, hey, by the way, I'm working with the FBI,
[03:43:46.460 --> 03:43:48.460]  Fed: that whole thing goes kaput
[03:43:48.460 --> 03:43:49.460]  Fed: Right?
[03:43:49.460 --> 03:43:50.460]  Fed: I mean, it doesn't help us.
[03:43:50.460 --> 03:43:53.460]  Fed: So that's why a lot of this stuff, too.
[03:43:53.460 --> 03:43:55.460]  Fed: If you're to give us information,
[03:43:55.460 --> 03:43:58.460]  Fed: it was partial information and it was omitted, right?
[03:43:58.460 --> 03:44:01.460]  Fed: There's a part in the court called discovery, right?
[03:44:01.460 --> 03:44:02.460]  Fed: I'm not sure how it works.
[03:44:02.460 --> 03:44:05.460]  Fed: So with Discovery, we have to provide everything to defend.
[03:44:05.460 --> 03:44:07.460]  Fed: That's how every U.S. government works, right?
[03:44:07.460 --> 03:44:10.460]  Fed: Everything that we have that we're using to prosecute this guy,
[03:44:10.460 --> 03:44:11.460]  Fed: the defense gets a copy of it.
[03:44:11.460 --> 03:44:13.460]  Fed: So they can cross-examine you on it, right?
[03:44:13.460 --> 03:44:14.460]  Val: Right.
[03:44:14.460 --> 03:44:16.460]  Val: So if anything illegal is happening and they... your case is screwed
[03:44:16.460 --> 03:44:20.460]  Fed: So in the case that if you gave us partial information,
[03:44:20.460 --> 03:44:22.460]  Fed: we'd provide that to the defense.
[03:44:22.460 --> 03:44:23.460]  Fed: The defense obviously knows the full story
[03:44:23.460 --> 03:44:25.460]  Fed: because they're the ones being charged.
[03:44:25.460 --> 03:44:27.460]  Fed: They say, actually, I said a bunch of stuff
[03:44:27.460 --> 03:44:28.460]  Fed: that is exculpatory.
[03:44:28.460 --> 03:44:30.460]  Fed: In other words, stuff that shows that I was innocent,
[03:44:30.460 --> 03:44:32.460]  Fed: but it was selectively filtered out.
[03:44:32.460 --> 03:44:34.460]  Fed: Our whole case would go to shit.
[03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:36.460]  Val: [???]
[03:44:36.460 --> 03:44:37.460]  Fed: Exactly, right.
[03:44:37.460 --> 03:44:40.460]  Fed: So just how it's not fair for Prasada to do that to you, right?
[03:44:40.460 --> 03:44:41.460]  Val: Right.
[03:44:41.460 --> 03:44:45.460]  Fed: So as the U.S. government, because we are the U.S. government,
[03:44:45.460 --> 03:44:48.460]  Fed: we play exactly by the rules, every time.
[03:44:48.460 --> 03:44:50.460]  Val: So is there a guy, a middle manager there, at some point,
[03:44:50.460 --> 03:44:54.460]  Val: that says, I decide what goes into this reporting
[03:44:54.460 --> 03:44:55.460]  Val: and what does not go into the report?
[03:44:55.460 --> 03:44:56.460]  Val: So it's not my decision.
[03:44:56.460 --> 03:44:59.460]  Val: I just give you all the data you ask for, right?
[03:44:59.460 --> 03:45:02.460]  Val: Without any omission, and someone else makes that decision.
[03:45:02.460 --> 03:45:03.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:45:03.460 --> 03:45:06.460]  Fed: Yeah, it's usually the case agent who would be working with you
[03:45:06.460 --> 03:45:09.460]  Fed: who would say, okay, hey, I'm going to write this report.
[03:45:09.460 --> 03:45:12.460]  Fed: And we write it in a way that doesn't disclose everything, right?
[03:45:12.460 --> 03:45:14.460]  Fed: Because if I write your name in my report...
[03:45:14.460 --> 03:45:16.460]  Fed: It protects your identity, but it's still...
[03:45:16.460 --> 03:45:18.460]  Fed: It doesn't hide anything.
[03:45:18.460 --> 03:45:23.460]  Val: We'll often put you guys in position to make you look bad,
[03:45:23.460 --> 03:45:25.460]  Val: but, you know, try to get it.
[03:45:25.460 --> 03:45:26.460]  Val: Try to get it.
[03:45:26.460 --> 03:45:27.460]  Fed: So anyway...
[03:45:27.460 --> 03:45:29.460]  Val: Cover your ass and get it.
[03:45:29.460 --> 03:45:30.460]  Fed: Right.
[03:45:30.460 --> 03:45:32.460]  Fed: That's just the general way we work with people
[03:45:32.460 --> 03:45:34.460]  Fed: because we work with a lot of different people
[03:45:34.460 --> 03:45:35.460]  Fed: in a lot of different areas of life.
[03:45:35.460 --> 03:45:38.460]  Fed: Like, I work drugs and drug dealers on my account,
[03:45:38.460 --> 03:45:40.460]  Fed: and, you know, we work with them.
[03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:41.460]  Val: [???] drug dealers?
[03:45:41.460 --> 03:45:42.460]  Fed: Mm-hmm.
[03:45:42.460 --> 03:45:43.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:45:43.460 --> 03:45:44.460]  Fed: Because we've got to work our way into the chain.
[03:45:44.460 --> 03:45:45.460]  Fed: How else do you think...
[03:45:45.460 --> 03:45:46.460]  Fed: You can't just get the runners all day, right?
[03:45:46.460 --> 03:45:47.460]  Val: Right.
[03:45:47.460 --> 03:45:49.460]  Fed: You get in the tenants and you get the people at the top
[03:45:49.460 --> 03:45:50.460]  Fed: and try to...
[03:45:51.460 --> 03:45:52.460]  Val: I don't get it.
[03:45:53.460 --> 03:45:54.460]  Val: It's completely...
[03:45:54.460 --> 03:45:55.460]  Val: It's completely...
[03:45:55.460 --> 03:45:57.460]  Fed: Kind of like what we said downstairs.
[03:45:57.460 --> 03:45:59.460]  Fed: It 's hard, right?
[03:45:59.460 --> 03:46:01.460]  Fed: It's hard to do this job,
[03:46:01.460 --> 03:46:02.460]  Fed: but it should be hard.
[03:46:02.460 --> 03:46:03.460]  Val: Because of the rules?
[03:46:03.460 --> 03:46:04.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:46:04.460 --> 03:46:05.460]  Fed: I mean, the rules are hard.
[03:46:05.460 --> 03:46:08.460]  Fed: Because that thing would be easy for us to do.
[03:46:08.460 --> 03:46:10.460]  Fed: But we're with the new rules.
[03:46:10.460 --> 03:46:12.460]  Fed: That's why we're going to do it with the new rules.
[03:46:12.460 --> 03:46:14.460]  Fed: Because it's the right thing to do.
[03:46:14.460 --> 03:46:16.460]  Val: Is it like a chain of evidence or a thing?
[03:46:16.460 --> 03:46:17.460]  Val: Like, there's like a cartel.
[03:46:17.460 --> 03:46:19.460]  Val: You think, you know, there's a guy's IP address.
[03:46:19.460 --> 03:46:21.460]  Val: You know, there's email.
[03:46:21.460 --> 03:46:24.460]  Fed: So now that, like, drug dealers are using,
[03:46:24.460 --> 03:46:27.460]  Fed: like, the encrypted chat,
[03:46:27.460 --> 03:46:29.460]  Fed: it doesn't work to go to the telephone company
[03:46:29.460 --> 03:46:33.460]  Fed: and say, hey, we want to get a title-free on this cell phone
[03:46:33.460 --> 03:46:35.460]  Fed: so we can see all the types of things.
[03:46:35.460 --> 03:46:37.460]  Fed: That's all then in the water.
[03:46:37.460 --> 03:46:40.460]  Fed: And now in order to get their communication,
[03:46:40.460 --> 03:46:43.460]  Fed: like, you'd have to actually get a hold of the phone
[03:46:43.460 --> 03:46:44.460]  Fed: and put...
[03:46:44.460 --> 03:46:46.460]  Fed: And honestly, the way to do it is, like,
[03:46:46.460 --> 03:46:48.460]  Fed: you'd have to get someone inside the group.
[03:46:48.460 --> 03:46:50.460]  Val: Yeah, you clone the phone.
[03:46:50.460 --> 03:46:52.460]  Fed: Yeah, even then, like, you need someone to, like,
[03:46:52.460 --> 03:46:54.460]  20 or 70 men in that phone.
[03:46:54.460 --> 03:46:55.460]  Can it be an 8?
[03:46:55.460 --> 03:46:56.460]  Yeah, I got it.
[03:46:56.460 --> 03:46:58.460]  It still goes back to, like, that thing
[03:46:58.460 --> 03:47:00.460]  where you have to get someone inside.
[03:47:00.460 --> 03:47:02.460]  Fed: We can't just sit back and rely.
[03:47:02.460 --> 03:47:04.460]  Fed: Yeah, because it's not...
[03:47:04.460 --> 03:47:08.460]  Fed: It's because it's illegal to hack into the phone
[03:47:08.460 --> 03:47:12.460]  Fed: and to bring it back in Christian.
[03:47:12.460 --> 03:47:15.460]  Val: So even with a proper warrant, you cannot...
[03:47:15.460 --> 03:47:18.460]  Fed: Oh, yeah, exactly. With a proper warrant, you can't
[03:47:18.460 --> 03:47:21.460]  Fed: because the technology is against that now.
[03:47:21.460 --> 03:47:23.460]  Fed: ???
[03:47:23.460 --> 03:47:26.460]  Val: But if someone can still do it, it's still doable, right?
[03:47:26.460 --> 03:47:30.460]  Fed: Like, if someone was using some app that the data was still
[03:47:30.460 --> 03:47:32.460]  Fed: housed with the service provider,
[03:47:32.460 --> 03:47:34.460]  Fed: then, yeah, yeah, it would do it.
[03:47:34.460 --> 03:47:36.460]  Fed: Because it's legally within the bounds
[03:47:36.460 --> 03:47:39.460]  Fed: and that company legally has the content.
[03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:41.460]  Val: Is it too much for me to ask, like,
[03:47:41.460 --> 03:47:43.460]  Val: what is legally outside the bounds?
[03:47:43.460 --> 03:47:46.460]  Fed: [unintelligible]
[03:47:46.460 --> 03:47:49.460]  Val: And it's just an hacking situation.
[03:47:49.460 --> 03:47:52.460]  Val: Like, if you know a cartel guy and you have a warrant,
[03:47:52.460 --> 03:47:55.460]  Val: what can you legally not do?
[03:47:55.460 --> 03:47:58.460]  Val: Yeah, I think maybe it's easier.
[03:47:58.460 --> 03:48:00.460]  Val: I'm just curious.
[03:48:00.460 --> 03:48:04.460]  Fed: You can't break any law in order to get access to that guy.
[03:48:04.460 --> 03:48:06.460]  Val: Civil rights?
[03:48:06.460 --> 03:48:08.460]  Fed: No, we can't do the hacking.
[03:48:08.460 --> 03:48:09.460]  Val: You can't?
[03:48:09.460 --> 03:48:11.460]  Fed: Yeah, no, we can't.
[03:48:11.460 --> 03:48:13.460]  Fed: Yeah, [??] the hacking or anything.
[03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:15.460]  Fed: And giving a court order or a search warrant
[03:48:15.460 --> 03:48:18.460]  Fed: to an ISP or a telecom provider is not hacking.
[03:48:18.460 --> 03:48:21.460]  Fed: There's a law that says we can do that.
[03:48:21.460 --> 03:48:23.460]  Fed: The warrant is what permits us to get things
[03:48:23.460 --> 03:48:25.460]  Fed: that are under reasonable expectation of privacy,
[03:48:25.460 --> 03:48:27.460]  Fed: which is what you're hacking.
[03:48:27.460 --> 03:48:30.460]  Fed: You're hacking because it's not publicly available.
[03:48:30.460 --> 03:48:32.460]  Fed: So if you have to breach that expectation of privacy,
[03:48:32.460 --> 03:48:35.460]  Fed: we need a warrant as a government to get that.
[03:48:35.460 --> 03:48:37.460]  Fed: The warrant will specify what you can and can't do.
[03:48:37.460 --> 03:48:40.460]  Val: And you can breach the expectation of privacy.
[03:48:40.460 --> 03:48:43.460]  Fed: And if this is all to protect against, you know,
[03:48:43.460 --> 03:48:46.460]  Fed: all the crazy shit that goes on and abuses and things like that.
[03:48:46.460 --> 03:48:48.460]  Fed: So, like, I mean, as much as the government
[03:48:48.460 --> 03:48:50.460]  Fed: is kind of a fuck up shit show,
[03:48:50.460 --> 03:48:53.460]  Fed: I mean, it is put up in a way to protect people,
[03:48:53.460 --> 03:48:54.460]  Fed: protect American people.
[03:48:54.460 --> 03:48:56.460]  Fed: Their privacy, their liberty, things like that.
[03:48:56.460 --> 03:48:57.460]  Fed: So when people think like,
[03:48:57.460 --> 03:48:58.460]  Fed: like my mom does the same thing,
[03:48:58.460 --> 03:49:00.460]  Fed: she's like, well, are you reading my e-mail that [??]?
[03:49:00.460 --> 03:49:01.460]  Fed: I don't have time to read your e-mail.
[03:49:01.460 --> 03:49:02.460]  Fed: One.
[03:49:02.460 --> 03:49:04.460]  Fed: And two, like, why would I be reading your e-mail?
[03:49:04.460 --> 03:49:05.460]  Fed: That doesn't make any sense.
[03:49:05.460 --> 03:49:06.460]  Val: Trust me, I did it.
[03:49:06.460 --> 03:49:07.460]  Val: You don't want to read your mom's e-mail.
[03:49:07.460 --> 03:49:11.460]  Val: You don't want to do that.
[03:49:11.460 --> 03:49:13.460]  Fed: Can't go backwards.
[03:49:13.460 --> 03:49:14.460]  Val: You can't.
[03:49:16.460 --> 03:49:17.460]  Fed: Yeah, so there's...
[03:49:17.460 --> 03:49:18.460]  Val: I get it.
[03:49:18.460 --> 03:49:20.460]  Fed: Yeah, there's limitations that we work under, but...
[03:49:20.460 --> 03:49:21.460]  Val: I like that.
[03:49:21.460 --> 03:49:22.460]  Val: It's fine.
[03:49:22.460 --> 03:49:26.460]  Val: It's like, you know, everyone has to have a...
[03:49:26.460 --> 03:49:28.460]  Fed: Yeah, we play about the rules.
[03:49:28.460 --> 03:49:30.460]  Fed: But when we do win, right,
[03:49:30.460 --> 03:49:32.460]  Fed: when we do arrest someone or something like that,
[03:49:32.460 --> 03:49:34.460]  Fed: our cases are, you know, airtight, right?
[03:49:34.460 --> 03:49:36.460]  Fed: We've covered every angle that we can.
[03:49:36.460 --> 03:49:37.460]  Fed: We've got all the information,
[03:49:37.460 --> 03:49:39.460]  Fed: and we've vetted everything to make sure that,
[03:49:39.460 --> 03:49:40.460]  Fed: we have the right person, right?
[03:49:40.460 --> 03:49:42.460]  Fed: We want to make sure we have the right person,
[03:49:42.460 --> 03:49:44.460]  Fed: and we have everything that leads up to it.
[03:49:44.460 --> 03:49:46.460]  Fed: So, anyway, that's all just background
[03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:48.460]  Fed: on how we work and how we work with sources
[03:49:48.460 --> 03:49:49.460]  Fed: and stuff like that.
[03:49:49.460 --> 03:49:50.460]  Val: That's good.
[03:49:50.460 --> 03:49:52.460]  Val: I like to do extremely different things.
[03:49:52.460 --> 03:49:54.460]  Val: Cause, it's really like Tim and Jami.
[03:49:54.460 --> 03:49:56.460]  Val: Tim and Jami are very different.
[03:49:56.460 --> 03:49:58.460]  Fed: Yeah, because I think that's the other thing, too,
[03:49:58.460 --> 03:50:00.460]  Fed: is if we break the rules to get to our end of goal,
[03:50:00.460 --> 03:50:02.460]  Fed: how are we getting better than the bad guys?
[03:50:02.460 --> 03:50:03.460]  Val: Right.
[03:50:03.460 --> 03:50:04.460]  Val: Right, and justifying it.
[03:50:04.460 --> 03:50:05.460]  Fed: Yeah, it's easy.
[03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:07.460]  Fed: I mean, it'd be easy for me to hack into a bunch of stuff,
[03:50:07.460 --> 03:50:09.460]  Fed: but then I'm just a hacker.
[03:50:09.460 --> 03:50:12.460]  Fed: I'm just a criminal doing rogue stuff.
[03:50:12.460 --> 03:50:14.460]  Val: Oh, vigilante.
[03:50:14.460 --> 03:50:16.460]  Fed: True, but vigilante is just not far.
[03:50:16.460 --> 03:50:19.460]  Fed: Anyway, that goes a whole different term.
[03:50:19.460 --> 03:50:21.460]  Val: Let's say that for a Signal group.
[03:50:21.460 --> 03:50:22.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:50:24.460 --> 03:50:25.460]  Fed: So, what else do I have?
[03:50:25.460 --> 03:50:27.460]  Fed: Okay, we talked about Irish bank fraud.
[03:50:27.460 --> 03:50:31.460]  Fed: OCCP, you're an admin on Hunter.ddos.
[03:50:31.460 --> 03:50:32.460]  Val: Both.
[03:50:35.460 --> 03:50:37.460]  Fed: The use of OCCP.
[03:50:37.460 --> 03:50:38.460]  Val: OCCRP, yeah.
[03:50:38.460 --> 03:50:39.460]  Fed: OCCRP is down?
[03:50:39.460 --> 03:50:40.460]  Val: No, it's up.
[03:50:40.460 --> 03:50:41.460]  Fed: Okay, yeah.
[03:50:41.460 --> 03:50:42.460]  Fed: So, you're an admin on goal?
[03:50:42.460 --> 03:50:43.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:50:43.460 --> 03:50:45.460]  Val: Well, I have an account.
[03:50:45.460 --> 03:50:46.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:50:46.460 --> 03:50:47.460]  Val: And...
[03:50:47.460 --> 03:50:49.460]  Val: I know how to understand the documents, too,
[03:50:49.460 --> 03:50:50.460]  Val: which is...
[03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:53.460]  Val: I've learned a lot from the government.
[03:50:53.460 --> 03:50:56.460]  Val: So, if you need to...
[03:50:56.460 --> 03:50:58.460]  Val: If you want to know what a CLO is,
[03:50:58.460 --> 03:51:00.460]  Val: why it's important that it happens in 2008
[03:51:00.460 --> 03:51:04.460]  Val: in Ireland versus the UK,
[03:51:04.460 --> 03:51:06.460]  Val: I can help you understand that.
[03:51:06.460 --> 03:51:07.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:51:08.460 --> 03:51:09.460]  Fed: Let's see.
[03:51:09.460 --> 03:51:10.460]  Fed: You have...
[03:51:10.460 --> 03:51:12.460]  Fed: David Eichrich has...
[03:51:12.460 --> 03:51:16.460]  Fed: Well, I guess he tasks you to get into Epstein's email
[03:51:16.460 --> 03:51:19.460]  Fed: and Epstein's wife's email.
[03:51:19.460 --> 03:51:21.460]  Val: You know what he's password was?
[03:51:21.460 --> 03:51:23.460]  Val: It's so funny.
[03:51:23.460 --> 03:51:24.460]  Val: It's G-21.
[03:51:30.460 --> 03:51:31.460]  Val: A little same job.
Fed: How long'd that take you?
Val: About five minutes.
[03:51:39.460 --> 03:51:41.460]  Val: You can just look at the old hacks from...
[03:51:41.460 --> 03:51:42.460]  Fed: Oh, right.
[03:51:42.460 --> 03:51:43.460]  Val: Yeah, pretty easy.
[03:51:43.460 --> 03:51:45.460]  Val: But don't tell anybody.
[03:51:45.460 --> 03:51:49.460]  Fed: You're also in a single group with Barrett,
[03:51:49.460 --> 03:51:54.460]  Fed: Emma, Xan, your friend,
[03:51:54.460 --> 03:51:56.460]  Fed: and like a hundred other people there.
[03:51:56.460 --> 03:51:57.460]  Val: And a lot of journalists.
[03:51:57.460 --> 03:51:58.460]  Fed: Journalists.
[03:51:58.460 --> 03:51:59.460]  Fed: Journalists.
[03:51:59.460 --> 03:52:00.460]  Fed: Journalists.
[03:52:00.460 --> 03:52:01.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:01.460 --> 03:52:02.460]  Fed: You're capable of doing some email hacks
[03:52:02.460 --> 03:52:06.460]  Fed: and then you'll do some light forensics.
[03:52:06.460 --> 03:52:08.460]  Fed: I guess with this single group...
[03:52:08.460 --> 03:52:09.460]  Val: I'm good with forensics
[03:52:09.460 --> 03:52:10.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:10.460 --> 03:52:11.460]  Val: Not light.
[03:52:11.460 --> 03:52:12.460]  Fed: That's...
[03:52:12.460 --> 03:52:13.460]  Val: I've been practicing a lot with that.
[03:52:13.460 --> 03:52:16.460]  Val: That's like my latest interest.
[03:52:16.460 --> 03:52:17.460]  Val: But mostly...
[03:52:17.460 --> 03:52:18.460]  Val: But with the software.
[03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:20.460]  Val: It happened, you know, not on my own.
[03:52:20.460 --> 03:52:22.460]  Val: I'm not coding it or writing it.
[03:52:22.460 --> 03:52:24.460]  Fed: I don't think many people are coding it
[03:52:24.460 --> 03:52:25.460]  Fed: or writing it themselves.
[03:52:25.460 --> 03:52:26.460]  Val: No? Ok good.
[03:52:26.460 --> 03:52:28.460]  Val: I think it's a little bit better than...
[03:52:28.460 --> 03:52:30.460]  Val: But yeah, with Magnet, it was open source.
[03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:32.460]  Val: But with Magnet, of course, it's better.
[03:52:32.460 --> 03:52:33.460]  Val: Yeah, it's not like that.
[03:52:33.460 --> 03:52:34.460]  Val: I can prove that to you.
[03:52:34.460 --> 03:52:37.460]  Val: You need to do a demonstration of that.
[03:52:37.460 --> 03:52:38.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:41.460]  Fed: In the Signal group, you said Barrett...
[03:52:41.460 --> 03:52:43.460]  Fed: Barrett said that he's not getting anything legal.
[03:52:43.460 --> 03:52:44.460]  Fed: Is that right?
[03:52:44.460 --> 03:52:45.460]  Fed: Or not getting anything stupid?
[03:52:45.460 --> 03:52:46.460]  Val: No.
[03:52:46.460 --> 03:52:48.460]  Val: He's always saying something stupid.
[03:52:48.460 --> 03:52:50.460]  Val: But he's just, you know, he's just a rabblerouser.
[03:52:50.460 --> 03:52:53.460]  Val: Let's see what happens after he calms down a bit.
[03:52:53.460 --> 03:52:55.460]  Val: Because he's high a lot.
[03:52:55.460 --> 03:52:56.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:52:56.460 --> 03:52:57.460]  Val: He was very high.
[03:52:57.460 --> 03:52:59.460]  Val: And he was not happy.
[03:52:59.460 --> 03:53:01.460]  Val: So it was more worried about him.
[03:53:01.460 --> 03:53:03.460]  Val: No one really took it seriously.
[03:53:03.460 --> 03:53:06.460]  Fed: You said the rest of the stuff in that group is mainly...
[03:53:06.460 --> 03:53:08.460]  Fed: People miscontented about stuff.
[03:53:08.460 --> 03:53:09.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:53:09.460 --> 03:53:11.460]  Fed: You said these steps are basically just bitching a lot.
[03:53:11.460 --> 03:53:12.460]  Fed: But like...
[03:53:12.460 --> 03:53:14.460]  Val: A lot of, like, fuck Louise Mensch, you know...
[03:53:14.460 --> 03:53:17.460]  Val: And like, well, actually, I couldn't want to fuck Louise Mensch.
[03:53:17.460 --> 03:53:19.460]  Val: You know, like, well, why would you want to do that?
[03:53:19.460 --> 03:53:21.460]  Val: You know, it's like that stuff.
[03:53:21.460 --> 03:53:23.460]  Val: You know, look at this Twitter post.
[03:53:23.460 --> 03:53:26.460]  Val: Or this cop just beat up this woman on the street.
[03:53:26.460 --> 03:53:28.460]  Val: You know, there's a lot of that, too.
[03:53:28.460 --> 03:53:29.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:53:29.460 --> 03:53:30.460]  Val: With the riots and stuff.
[03:53:30.460 --> 03:53:31.460]  Fed: Sure.
[03:53:31.460 --> 03:53:35.460]  Val: But if you're asking if there's, like, organization or people are getting together and, you know...
[03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:38.460]  Val: I think they're very watched.
[03:53:38.460 --> 03:53:40.460]  Val: You know, there's no organization.
[03:53:40.460 --> 03:53:41.460]  Val: It's like, it's just chaos.
[03:53:41.460 --> 03:53:42.460]  Val: It's fun to see what happens.
[03:53:42.460 --> 03:53:44.460]  Val: It's like, might come out of it, yeah.
[03:53:44.460 --> 03:53:46.460]  Val: And I meet some interesting people.
[03:53:46.460 --> 03:53:48.460]  Fed: There's nothing, nothing explicitly illegal.
[03:53:48.460 --> 03:53:53.460]  Fed: They don't talk about, you know, collectivity or hacking stuff or anything like that.
[03:53:53.460 --> 03:53:54.460]  Val: Why?
[03:53:54.460 --> 03:53:55.460]  Val: Well, yeah, of course.
[03:53:55.460 --> 03:53:57.460]  Val: No, there is a talk about that, yeah.
[03:53:57.460 --> 03:53:59.460]  Val: But it's like a friend of mine says,
[03:53:59.460 --> 03:54:08.460]  Val: Oh, do you know how I get ISPs from Prague, you know, circa 2016?
[03:54:08.460 --> 03:54:10.460]  Val: Clearly, you're trying to find the Cohen shit, right?
[03:54:10.460 --> 03:54:12.460]  Val: You know, everyone's a loving the baby.
[03:54:12.460 --> 03:54:14.460]  Val: You know, stuff like that, you know.
[03:54:14.460 --> 03:54:16.460]  Val: And if you have it, you know where to get it.
[03:54:16.460 --> 03:54:18.460]  Val: Sure here you go
[03:54:18.460 --> 03:54:19.460]  Val: There's a link.
[03:54:19.460 --> 03:54:20.460]  Val: Do you know what Irish bankers are?
[03:54:20.460 --> 03:54:23.460]  Val: The other day, I mean, an Irish banker that knows how to do,
[03:54:23.460 --> 03:54:25.460]  Val: you know, anybody in Ireland right now.
[03:54:25.460 --> 03:54:27.460]  Val: I'm here to get some coin telegraph.
[03:54:27.460 --> 03:54:29.460]  Val: Yeah, stuff like that.
[03:54:29.460 --> 03:54:35.460]  Val: But like, I'm the only idiot that says, Hey, Emma,
[03:54:35.460 --> 03:54:38.460]  Val: can you give me a favor and help me hack David Enrich?
[03:54:38.460 --> 03:54:40.460]  Val: Because I got to get into his fucking email.
[03:54:40.460 --> 03:54:42.460]  Val: I'm the only idiot that says that.
[03:54:42.460 --> 03:54:44.460]  Val: So, yeah.
[03:54:44.460 --> 03:54:45.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:54:45.460 --> 03:54:48.460]  Fed: So no one else talked about like who's behind hack or who's behind it?
[03:54:48.460 --> 03:54:49.460]  Val: Oh, yeah.
[03:54:49.460 --> 03:54:50.460]  Val: I know.
[03:54:50.460 --> 03:54:51.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:54:51.460 --> 03:54:53.460]  Val: There's a really good big discussion on who's behind Lulzs.
[03:54:53.460 --> 03:54:55.460]  Fed: Oh, LulzSec, I think.
[03:54:55.460 --> 03:55:00.460]  Val: Or, well, no, the abbreviated version of LulzSec.
[03:55:00.460 --> 03:55:01.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:55:01.460 --> 03:55:03.460]  Val: It's like a, whoever did the Cayman Islands
[03:55:03.460 --> 03:55:04.460]  Fed: Oh, yeah.
[03:55:04.460 --> 03:55:06.460]  Fed: Who do they think is behind the Cayman Islands?
[03:55:06.460 --> 03:55:09.460]  Fed: I said they, I mean, what are some of the opinions of?
[03:55:09.460 --> 03:55:12.460]  Val: All I know is my opinion right now, as I can remember,
[03:55:12.460 --> 03:55:14.460]  Val: and I'm not holding back or meaning information,
[03:55:14.460 --> 03:55:16.460]  Val: because I just can't remember.
[03:55:16.460 --> 03:55:18.460]  Val: But if you give me time to look, I'll find it for you.
[03:55:18.460 --> 03:55:21.460]  Val: My opinion is, I think it's Emma.
[03:55:21.460 --> 03:55:24.460]  Val: The Spanish, the Spanish is broken.
[03:55:24.460 --> 03:55:27.460]  Val: Again, Marie speaks eight languages.
[03:55:27.460 --> 03:55:29.460]  Val: She told me it's not a first.
[03:55:29.460 --> 03:55:30.460]  Fed: It's not a native speaker.
[03:55:30.460 --> 03:55:31.460]  Val: It's not a native speaker.
[03:55:31.460 --> 03:55:36.460]  Val: And the angry, the anger sort of matches Emma's anger.
[03:55:36.460 --> 03:55:39.460]  Val: And the thought process that makes, gets you to write a certain sentence,
[03:55:39.460 --> 03:55:41.460]  Val: matches her thought process.
[03:55:41.460 --> 03:55:42.460]  Val: The way I figured it anyway.
[03:55:42.460 --> 03:55:44.460]  Val: You know, you have to, in order to say the certain sentence,
[03:55:44.460 --> 03:55:46.460]  Val: you have to think and feel the sort of thing.
[03:55:46.460 --> 03:55:48.460]  Val: We're in the, we're in this frame group.
[03:55:48.460 --> 03:55:50.460]  Val: And I see that pattern matched with it.
[03:55:50.460 --> 03:55:54.460]  Fed: So what Spanish document was it that matched?
[03:55:54.460 --> 03:55:55.460]  Val: The manifesto.
[03:55:55.460 --> 03:55:56.460]  Fed: Oh, the manifesto.
[03:55:57.460 --> 03:55:58.460]  Fed: Okay.
[03:55:58.460 --> 03:55:59.460]  Fed: Interesting.
[03:55:59.460 --> 03:56:00.460]  Fed: So aside from like the speech pattern,
[03:56:00.460 --> 03:56:02.460]  Fed: is there anything else, any other reason why you think
[03:56:02.460 --> 03:56:04.460]  Fed: that Best is behind the Cayman Islands?
[03:56:04.460 --> 03:56:07.460]  Val: Well, the thought process, obviously.
[03:56:07.460 --> 03:56:08.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:56:08.460 --> 03:56:09.460]  Fed: The motivation, I guess, right?
[03:56:09.460 --> 03:56:10.460]  Val: It's really angry.
[03:56:10.460 --> 03:56:11.460]  Val: Well, no, no more.
[03:56:11.460 --> 03:56:14.460]  Val: The motivation, well, you must know.
[03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:16.460]  Val: I mean, if you're a hacker, you know,
[03:56:16.460 --> 03:56:19.460]  Val: the motivation is just, you can do it.
[03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:21.460]  Val: You know, sometimes, yeah, you're broke, you need some money.
[03:56:21.460 --> 03:56:24.460]  Val: Or if you want to, you know, see, I'm better than you or not.
[03:56:24.460 --> 03:56:26.460]  Val: But it's like, here's a challenge.
[03:56:26.460 --> 03:56:28.460]  Val: You know, that's most of the motivation.
[03:56:28.460 --> 03:56:30.460]  Val: You should know that though, right?
[03:56:30.460 --> 03:56:31.460]  Fed: But it's different, too.
[03:56:31.460 --> 03:56:32.460]  Val: Oh, you mean political motivation.
[03:56:32.460 --> 03:56:33.460]  Fed: There's different motivations, too,
[03:56:33.460 --> 03:56:34.460]  Fed: with different hackers, too, right?
[03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:36.460]  Fed: Some hackers are just curious.
[03:56:36.460 --> 03:56:38.460]  Fed: Like, they just want to see if they can break the system.
[03:56:38.460 --> 03:56:40.460]  Fed: But they're the ones who hack for a purpose, right?
[03:56:40.460 --> 03:56:42.460]  Fed: Like, a lot of the hacktivists out there,
[03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:43.460]  Fed: you know, they'll hack because...
[03:56:43.460 --> 03:56:44.460]  Val: BlueLeaks.
[03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:45.460]  Fed: What about...
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:47.460]  Val: We're talking about BlueLeaks, aren't we?
[03:56:47.460 --> 03:56:48.460]  Fed: What about BlueLeaks leak?
[03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:50.460]  Val: That's what you're asking about.
[03:56:50.460 --> 03:56:52.460]  Fed: Well, there's a bunch of different types of things.
[03:56:52.460 --> 03:56:53.460]  Val: I don't know.
[03:56:53.460 --> 03:56:58.460]  Val: So, the BlueLeaks appeared on...
[03:56:58.460 --> 03:57:01.460]  Val: Honestly, I don't know why you're going after Emma.
[03:57:01.460 --> 03:57:03.460]  Val: I don't think she did it.
[03:57:03.460 --> 03:57:05.460]  Val: First of all, I think she did the Cayman one.
[03:57:05.460 --> 03:57:06.460]  Val: I don't think he did BlueLeaks.
[03:57:06.460 --> 03:57:08.460]  Val: BlueLeaks was...
[03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:11.460]  Val: But you know, and I'm sure you know,
[03:57:11.460 --> 03:57:15.460]  Val: and I'm sure you know that your computer systems are outdated.
[03:57:15.460 --> 03:57:16.460]  Val: Right?
[03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:17.460]  Val: Okay?
[03:57:17.460 --> 03:57:19.460]  Val: They're fucking really outdated, right?
[03:57:19.460 --> 03:57:22.460]  Val: And the FBI's computer systems are outdated.
[03:57:22.460 --> 03:57:25.460]  Val: What do you think the local sheriff's fucking office in Minnesota
[03:57:25.460 --> 03:57:28.460]  Val: is still running, like, Windows NT, right?
[03:57:28.460 --> 03:57:31.460]  Val: So, it's not difficult, you know?
[03:57:31.460 --> 03:57:34.460]  Val: And I think it's consortium.
[03:57:34.460 --> 03:57:37.460]  Val: My personal opinion, based on no evidence at all,
[03:57:37.460 --> 03:57:42.460]  Val: is that a consortium hackers was pissed off about the...
[03:57:42.460 --> 03:57:44.460]  Val: the Black Lives Matter, I think, cause fuck the police
[03:57:44.460 --> 03:57:46.460]  Val: and here's the revenge.
[03:57:46.460 --> 03:57:49.460]  Val: I don't think it was, you know,
[03:57:49.460 --> 03:57:51.460]  Val: politically motivated by...
[03:57:51.460 --> 03:57:56.460]  Val: motivated by some, like, left-wing George Soros fucking thing.
[03:57:56.460 --> 03:57:58.460]  Val: You know, conspiracy theory, right?
[03:57:58.460 --> 03:58:00.460]  Val: Just angry kids, you know?
[03:58:00.460 --> 03:58:01.460]  Val: That's it.
[03:58:01.460 --> 03:58:02.460]  Val: That's right.
[03:58:02.460 --> 03:58:03.460]  Val: But I could be wrong.
[03:58:03.460 --> 03:58:05.460]  Val: I'm often wrong.
[03:58:05.460 --> 03:58:07.460]  Fed: So, you don't think Emma Best's behind that
[03:58:07.460 --> 03:58:09.460]  Fed: But she's behind Cayman Islands and what else?
[03:58:09.460 --> 03:58:11.460]  Val: I personally, I think, Cayman yes.
[03:58:11.460 --> 03:58:15.460]  Val: Because just her reaction to my asking for the 100,000
[03:58:15.460 --> 03:58:18.460]  Val: in Bitcoin, Deutsche Bank, was sort of tipped me off.
[03:58:18.460 --> 03:58:21.460]  Val: You don't react like that if you're just the middle person.
[03:58:21.460 --> 03:58:23.460]  Fed: Interesting.
[03:58:23.460 --> 03:58:26.460]  Fed: Yeah, because she doesn't want to share it, though.
[03:58:26.460 --> 03:58:27.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:58:27.460 --> 03:58:31.460]  Fed: There's a prize attached to it, so...
[03:58:31.460 --> 03:58:32.460]  Fed: so there was...
[03:58:32.460 --> 03:58:33.460]  Fed: so that...
[03:58:33.460 --> 03:58:35.460]  Fed: you said there was, like, a lot of discussion about who...
[03:58:35.460 --> 03:58:37.460]  Fed: or who did the Cayman thing that there was a lot of discussion
[03:58:37.460 --> 03:58:39.460]  Fed: in the group of who...
[03:58:39.460 --> 03:58:40.460]  Val: Yeah.
[03:58:40.460 --> 03:58:44.460]  Fed: But just for the Caymans thing right now, so...
[03:58:44.460 --> 03:58:46.460]  Val: Well, Formations House as well.
[03:58:46.460 --> 03:58:48.460]  Val: I've done it before.
[03:58:48.460 --> 03:58:51.460]  Val: But actually, there was no discussion.
[03:58:51.460 --> 03:58:52.460]  Val: That's interesting.
[03:58:52.460 --> 03:58:53.460]  Val: You have a good point.
[03:58:53.460 --> 03:58:55.460]  Val: Yeah, there was no discussion for Formation House.
[03:58:55.460 --> 03:58:57.460]  Val: That means that Emma already knew who did it.
[03:58:57.460 --> 03:58:58.460]  Fed: Oh, yeah.
[03:58:58.460 --> 03:59:00.460]  Val: So that's why it's the way I take out statements.
[03:59:00.460 --> 03:59:01.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:59:01.460 --> 03:59:03.460]  Val: But since there was a lot of discussion for, like,
[03:59:03.460 --> 03:59:06.460]  Val: Caymans, that means no one really knew who did it.
[03:59:06.460 --> 03:59:08.460]  Fed: Who did Formations House?
[03:59:08.460 --> 03:59:09.460]  Val: I don't know.
[03:59:09.460 --> 03:59:10.460]  Val: It wasn't you.
[03:59:10.460 --> 03:59:11.460]  Val: I just joined the...
[03:59:11.460 --> 03:59:12.460]  Val: the thing in the...
[03:59:12.460 --> 03:59:14.460]  Val: well, Marie was stuck in France,
[03:59:14.460 --> 03:59:16.460]  Val: so that was the summer of last year.
[03:59:16.460 --> 03:59:18.460]  Val: That's when that happened.
[03:59:18.460 --> 03:59:20.460]  Val: But I did tell Tim Jammi? like,
[03:59:20.460 --> 03:59:22.460]  Val: hey, new data.
[03:59:22.460 --> 03:59:23.460]  Val: You know?
[03:59:23.460 --> 03:59:24.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[03:59:24.460 --> 03:59:26.460]  Val: And, oh, God, oh, the whip, yeah.
[03:59:26.460 --> 03:59:28.460]  Val: Okay, so I...
[03:59:28.460 --> 03:59:30.460]  Val: at this point, I'm, everyone knows,
[03:59:30.460 --> 03:59:32.460]  Val: I was working with the FBI, the source.
[03:59:32.460 --> 03:59:33.460]  Val: Well, Emma said to me,
[03:59:33.460 --> 03:59:36.460]  Val: I need you to relay a message to the FBI.
[03:59:36.460 --> 03:59:37.460]  Val: I was like, what?
[03:59:37.460 --> 03:59:39.460]  Val: She said, yes, I want you to give these guys a message.
[03:59:39.460 --> 03:59:40.460]  Val: Okay.
[03:59:40.460 --> 03:59:42.460]  Val: She's like, tell them about Formation Towns.
[03:59:42.460 --> 03:59:45.460]  Val: I want you to give them a list of people you've...
[03:59:45.460 --> 03:59:46.460]  Val: that are...
[03:59:46.460 --> 03:59:47.460]  Val: and I have it.
[03:59:47.460 --> 03:59:48.460]  Val: I can give you the email.
[03:59:48.460 --> 03:59:50.460]  Val: I'll just forward it to you when I get a chance.
[03:59:50.460 --> 03:59:51.460]  Val: Remind me, text me.
[03:59:51.460 --> 03:59:52.460]  Val: I don't forget.
[03:59:52.460 --> 03:59:54.460]  Val: And I gave it to Tim.
[03:59:54.460 --> 03:59:55.460]  Val: I gave it to Jeremy.[???]
[03:59:55.460 --> 03:59:56.460]  Val: And they were not...
[03:59:56.460 --> 03:59:57.460]  Val: they were like, okay, great.
[03:59:57.460 --> 03:59:58.460]  Val: We don't really care.
[03:59:58.460 --> 03:59:59.460]  Val: Like, give one to a Deutsche Bank.
[03:59:59.460 --> 04:00:01.460]  Val: We don't care about Formation Towns.
[04:00:01.460 --> 04:00:04.460]  Val: And Emma felt like she was not heard by the FBI
[04:00:04.460 --> 04:00:06.460]  Val: because she wanted to help,
[04:00:06.460 --> 04:00:08.460]  Val: but she was not heard.
[04:00:08.460 --> 04:00:09.460]  Val: She was offering help.
[04:00:09.460 --> 04:00:12.460]  Val: She said, look, I'll give you guys the data.
[04:00:12.460 --> 04:00:13.460]  Val: You have a time limit.
[04:00:13.460 --> 04:00:15.460]  Val: That's why it's going to go live in a month.
[04:00:15.460 --> 04:00:18.460]  Val: I'll give you three months to find the information.
[04:00:18.460 --> 04:00:20.460]  Val: I'll forward it to you.
[04:00:20.460 --> 04:00:21.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:00:21.460 --> 04:00:23.460]  Fed: I'm just writing a line to someone to text you.
[04:00:23.460 --> 04:00:24.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:00:24.460 --> 04:00:26.460]  Fed: I don't know if we got it.
[04:00:26.460 --> 04:00:28.460]  Fed: That's what I'm writing.
[04:00:28.460 --> 04:00:30.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:00:30.460 --> 04:00:31.460]  Fed: All right.
[04:00:31.460 --> 04:00:33.460]  Fed: Any other signal groups that...
[04:00:33.460 --> 04:00:35.460]  Fed: that you're part of that talk about hacking?
[04:00:35.460 --> 04:00:36.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:00:36.460 --> 04:00:37.460]  Val: Well, they're all...
[04:00:37.460 --> 04:00:39.460]  Val: I mean, all the varied groups.
[04:00:39.460 --> 04:00:41.460]  Val: I call them varied groups, but they're all, like, off-shoots.
[04:00:41.460 --> 04:00:42.460]  Fed: Oh, ok.
[04:00:42.460 --> 04:00:44.460]  Val: The Formations House one is still like this.
[04:00:44.460 --> 04:00:46.460]  Val: But, you know, it's like...
[04:00:46.460 --> 04:00:48.460]  Val: Well, I mean, no one's really posted for like,
[04:00:48.460 --> 04:00:49.460]  Val: like seven months.
[04:00:49.460 --> 04:00:50.460]  Val: Still there.
[04:00:50.460 --> 04:00:51.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:00:51.460 --> 04:00:53.460]  Val: And I created a few groups of my own, you know,
[04:00:53.460 --> 04:00:55.460]  Val: a Deutsche Bank group.
[04:00:55.460 --> 04:00:56.460]  Val: Journalists like a Luke Harding
[04:00:56.460 --> 04:00:58.460]  Val: and bunch of other journalists.
[04:00:58.460 --> 04:01:00.460]  Val: Oh, and every...
[04:01:00.460 --> 04:01:01.460]  Val: there's every...
[04:01:01.460 --> 04:01:03.460]  Val: once in a while, there's like a fun star chamber
[04:01:03.460 --> 04:01:06.460]  Val: where you get someone and everyone's going to stop at
[04:01:06.460 --> 04:01:09.460]  Val: and we put them in a group, you know, and we just sort of tap.
[04:01:09.460 --> 04:01:11.460]  Val: You know, see what they say.
[04:01:11.460 --> 04:01:12.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:01:12.460 --> 04:01:14.460]  Val: Well, like Louise Mensch, she put her in a group
[04:01:14.460 --> 04:01:16.460]  Val: and he started, you know, what the fuck are you doing?
[04:01:16.460 --> 04:01:18.460]  Val: Why did you say this about Scott's father?
[04:01:18.460 --> 04:01:19.460]  Val: Scott Steadman's father is a cop.
[04:01:19.460 --> 04:01:20.460]  Fed: Oh.
[04:01:20.460 --> 04:01:21.460]  Val: She doxxed me.
[04:01:21.460 --> 04:01:22.460]  Fed: Oh.
[04:01:22.460 --> 04:01:23.460]  Val: What the fuck are you doing?
[04:01:23.460 --> 04:01:24.460]  Val: Why are you going after his father?
[04:01:24.460 --> 04:01:26.460]  Val: You know, she's like, well, he's a Russian spy.
[04:01:26.460 --> 04:01:27.460]  Val: You know, you're just fucking crazy.
[04:01:27.460 --> 04:01:29.460]  Val: Do you understand what you're fucking doing?
[04:01:29.460 --> 04:01:30.460]  Val: That's weird.
[04:01:30.460 --> 04:01:31.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:01:31.460 --> 04:01:32.460]  Val: I think...
[04:01:32.460 --> 04:01:34.460]  Val: Like, David Enrich was supposed to be in one
[04:01:34.460 --> 04:01:37.460]  Val: right before COVID, the next guy.
[04:01:37.460 --> 04:01:38.460]  Val: It was a prize.
[04:01:38.460 --> 04:01:40.460]  Val: It was a present for me.
[04:01:40.460 --> 04:01:43.460]  Fed: It's like a little beat down room.
[04:01:43.460 --> 04:01:44.460]  Val: Yeah.
[04:01:44.460 --> 04:01:45.460]  Fed: That's weird.
[04:01:45.460 --> 04:01:47.460]  Fed: Hey, what are you talking about?
[04:01:47.460 --> 04:01:48.460]  Fed: What are you talking about?
[04:01:48.460 --> 04:01:49.460]  Fed: I'm talking about you.
[04:01:49.460 --> 04:01:50.460]  Fed: What?
[04:01:50.460 --> 04:01:51.460]  Fed: Cool.
[04:01:51.460 --> 04:01:53.460]  Fed: Anything else that I missed?
[04:01:53.460 --> 04:01:55.460]  Fed: Anything else that you think that...
[04:01:55.460 --> 04:01:56.460]  Val: Yes.
[04:01:56.460 --> 04:01:57.460]  Val: Tons of stuff
[04:01:57.460 --> 04:01:58.460]  Val: I can't remember all I have.
[04:01:58.460 --> 04:01:59.460]  Fed: Yeah, sure.
[04:01:59.460 --> 04:02:01.460]  Val: But if you ask me
[04:02:01.460 --> 04:02:03.460]  Val: If I remember...
[04:02:03.460 --> 04:02:05.460]  Val: I just...
[04:02:05.460 --> 04:02:07.460]  Val: I will remember it.
[04:02:07.460 --> 04:02:09.460]  Val: I have to be in a mindset.
[04:02:09.460 --> 04:02:10.460]  Fed: Sure.
[04:02:10.460 --> 04:02:12.460]  Val: You know, I mean, like...
[04:02:12.460 --> 04:02:14.460]  Val: your memory is...
[04:02:14.460 --> 04:02:15.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:02:16.460 --> 04:02:18.460]  Fed: Yeah, if I was going to ask you about something very specific.
[04:02:18.460 --> 04:02:20.460]  Fed: You could recall more about them.
[04:02:20.460 --> 04:02:21.460]  Fed: Tell me everything you know about everything.
[04:02:21.460 --> 04:02:23.460]  Val: And right now, I'm like a...
[04:02:23.460 --> 04:02:24.460]  Val: I'm not even active anymore.
[04:02:24.460 --> 04:02:26.460]  Val: I'm [???] stuff right now from my memory
[04:02:26.460 --> 04:02:27.460]  Val: because I'm in this room.
[04:02:27.460 --> 04:02:28.460]  Val: And I'm a little bit nervous.
[04:02:28.460 --> 04:02:29.460]  Val: I'm a bit not nervous.
[04:02:29.460 --> 04:02:31.460]  Val: So my brain is adapted to that point.
[04:02:31.460 --> 04:02:33.460]  Val: So as soon as I walk out of the room,
[04:02:33.460 --> 04:02:34.460]  Val: I'm like, oh, we're going to say that.
[04:02:34.460 --> 04:02:35.460]  Fed: Yeah, yeah.
[04:02:35.460 --> 04:02:36.460]  Val: You know what I mean?
[04:02:36.460 --> 04:02:37.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:02:37.460 --> 04:02:38.460]  Fed: So...
[04:02:38.460 --> 04:02:39.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:02:39.460 --> 04:02:40.460]  Fed: Anything else that...
[04:02:40.460 --> 04:02:41.460]  Fed: Oh, in turn?
[04:02:41.460 --> 04:02:42.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:02:42.460 --> 04:02:43.460]  Fed: Okay.
[04:02:43.460 --> 04:02:44.460]  Fed: Well, you still have my number so if like
[04:02:44.460 --> 04:02:46.460]  Fed: you think of something that...
[04:02:46.460 --> 04:02:48.460]  Fed: you think would be interested in, you know...
[04:02:48.460 --> 04:02:49.460]  Fed: surely you can always let me know
[04:02:49.460 --> 04:02:50.460]  Fed: and I can find a home for it.
[04:02:50.460 --> 04:02:51.460]  Val: You think?
[04:02:51.460 --> 04:02:53.460]  Val: And do you mean to prosecute?
[04:02:53.460 --> 04:02:54.460]  Val: Do you mean to go after it?
[04:02:54.460 --> 04:02:57.460]  Val: Do you mean to like to read that is...
[04:02:57.460 --> 04:02:58.460]  Val: that needs to be stopped?
[04:02:58.460 --> 04:02:59.460]  Val: Or would you say it's like,
[04:02:59.460 --> 04:03:02.460]  Val: oh, there's some fun just in hacks happening?
[04:03:02.460 --> 04:03:03.460]  Val: What do you mean?
[04:03:03.460 --> 04:03:05.460]  Fed: I mean, all those things are...
[04:03:05.460 --> 04:03:08.460]  Fed: I work a very narrow spectrum, right?
[04:03:08.460 --> 04:03:09.460]  Fed: I work cyber-crime.
[04:03:09.460 --> 04:03:10.460]  Val: Okay.
[04:03:10.460 --> 04:03:11.460]  Val: But there's...
[04:03:11.460 --> 04:03:12.460]  Val: You're fraud, though.
[04:03:12.460 --> 04:03:13.460]  Fed: Yeah.
[04:03:13.460 --> 04:03:15.460]  Fed: But there's also like counter-terrorism
[04:03:15.460 --> 04:03:16.460]  Fed: or white collar crimes
[04:03:16.460 --> 04:03:18.460]  Fed: or crimes against some children
[04:03:18.460 --> 04:03:20.460]  Fed: and national security threats.
